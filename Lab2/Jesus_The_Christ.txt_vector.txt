 PREFACE
 The
 scope
 of
 the
 subject
 presented
 in
 this
 work
 is
 expressed
 on
 the
 title
 page
 It
 will
 be
 readily
 seen
 that
 the
 author
 has
 departed
 from
 the
 course
 usually
 followed
 by
 writers
 on
 the
 Life
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 which
 course
 as
 a
 rule
 begins
 with
 the
 birth
 of
 Marys
 Babe
 and
 ends
 with
 the
 ascension
 of
 the
 slain
 and
 risen
 Lord
 from
 Olivet
 The
 treatment
 embodied
 in
 these
 pages
 in
 addition
 to
 the
 narrative
 of
 the
 Lords
 life
 in
 the
 flesh
 comprizes
 the
 antemortal
 existence
 and
 activities
 of
 the
 worlds
 Redeemer
 the
 revelations
 and
 personal
 manifestations
 of
 the
 glorified
 and
 exalted
 Son
 of
 God
 during
 the
 apostolic
 period
 of
 old
 and
 in
 modern
 times
 the
 assured
 nearness
 of
 the
 Lords
 second
 advent
 and
 predicted
 events
 beyondall
 so
 far
 as
 the
 Holy
 Scriptures
 make
 plain
 It
 is
 particularly
 congruous
 and
 appropriate
 that
 the
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 of
 Latterday
 Saintsthe
 only
 Church
 that
 affirms
 authority
 based
 on
 specific
 revelation
 and
 commission
 to
 use
 the
 Lords
 Holy
 Name
 as
 a
 distinctive
 designationshould
 set
 forth
 her
 doctrines
 concerning
 the
 Messiah
 and
 His
 mission
 The
 author
 of
 this
 volume
 entered
 upon
 his
 welcome
 service
 under
 request
 and
 appointment
 from
 the
 presiding
 authorities
 of
 the
 Church
 and
 the
 completed
 work
 has
 been
 read
 to
 and
 is
 approved
 by
 the
 First
 Presidency
 and
 the
 Council
 of
 the
 Twelve
 It
 presents
 however
 the

 personal
 belief
 and

 to
 the

 written
 The

 is
 published
 by
 the

 A
 characteristic
 feature
 of
 the
 work
 is
 the
 guidance
 afforded
 by
 modern
 scriptures
 and
 the
 explication
 of
 the
 Holy

 of
 olden
 times
 in
 the
 light
 of

 day
 revelation
 which
 as
 a
 powerful
 and
 well
 directed
 beam
 illumines
 many
 dark
 passages
 of
 ancient

 The
 spirit
 of
 the
 sacredness
 inherent
 in

 has
 been
 a
 constant
 companion
 of

 CHAPTER
 
 INTRODUCTION
 It
 is
 a
 matter
 of
 history
 that
 at
 or
 near
 the
 beginning
 of
 what
 has
 since
 come
 to
 be
 known
 as
 the
 Christian
 era
 the
 Man
 Jesus
 surnamed
 the
 Christ
 was
 born
 in
 Bethlehem
 of
 Judea
 The
 principal
 data
 as
 to
 His
 birth
 life
 and
 death
 are
 so
 well
 attested
 as
 to
 be
 reasonably
 indisputable
 they
 are
 facts
 of
 record
 and
 are
 accepted
 as
 essentially
 authentic
 by
 the
 civilized
 world
 at
 large
 True
 there
 are
 diversities
 of
 deduction
 based
 on
 alleged
 discrepancies
 in
 the
 records
 of
 the
 past
 as
 to
 circumstantial
 details
 but
 such
 differences
 are
 of
 strictly
 minor
 importance
 for
 none
 of
 them
 nor
 all
 taken
 together
 cast
 a
 shadow
 of
 rational
 doubt
 upon
 the
 historicity
 of
 the
 earthly
 existence
 of
 the
 Man
 known
 in
 literature
 as
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 As
 to
 who
 and
 what
 He
 was
 there
 are
 dissensions
 of
 grave
 moment
 dividing
 the
 opinions
 of
 men
 and
 this
 divergence
 of
 conception
 and
 belief
 is
 most
 pronounced
 upon
 those
 matters
 to
 which
 the
 greatest
 importance
 attaches
 The
 solemn
 testimonies
 of
 millions
 dead
 and
 of
 millions
 living
 unite
 in
 proclaiming
 Him
 as
 divine
 the
 Son
 of
 the
 Living
 God
 the
 Redeemer
 and
 Savior
 of
 the
 human
 race
 the
 Eternal
 Judge
 of
 the
 souls
 of
 men
 the
 Chosen
 and
 Anointed
 of
 the
 Fatherin
 short
 the
 Christ
 Others
 there
 are
 who
 deny
 His
 Godhood
 while
 extolling
 the
 transcendent
 qualities
 of
 His
 unparalleled
 and
 unapproachable
 Manhood
 To
 the
 student
 of
 history
 this
 Man
 among
 men
 stands
 first
 foremost
 and
 alone
 as
 a
 directing
 personality
 in
 the
 worlds
 progression
 Mankind
 has
 never
 produced
 a
 leader
 to
 rank
 with
 Him
 Regarded
 solely
 as
 a
 historic
 personage
 He
 is
 unique
 Judged
 by
 the
 standard
 of
 human
 estimation
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 is
 supreme
 among
 men
 by
 reason
 of
 the
 excellence
 of
 His
 personal
 character
 the
 simplicity
 beauty
 and
 genuine
 worth
 of
 His
 precepts
 and
 the
 influence
 of
 His
 example
 and
 doctrines
 in
 the
 advancement
 of
 the
 race
 To
 these
 distinguishing
 characteristics
 of
 surpassing
 greatness
 the
 devout
 Christian
 soul
 adds
 an
 attribute
 that
 far
 exceeds
 the
 sum
 of
 all
 the
 othersthe
 divinity
 of
 Christs
 origin
 and
 the
 eternal
 reality
 of
 His
 status
 as
 Lord
 and
 God
 Christian
 and
 unbeliever
 alike
 acknowledge
 His
 supremacy
 as
 a
 Man
 and
 respect
 the
 epochmaking
 significance
 of
 His
 birth
 Christ
 was
 born
 in
 the
 meridian
 of
 time
 and
 His
 life
 on
 earth
 marked
 at
 once
 the
 culmination
 of
 the
 past
 and
 the
 inauguration
 of
 an
 era
 distinctive
 in
 human
 hope
 endeavor
 and
 achievement
 His
 advent
 determined
 a
 new
 order
 in
 the
 reckoning
 of
 the
 years
 and
 by
 common
 consent
 the
 centuries
 antedating
 His
 birth
 have
 been
 counted
 backward
 from
 the
 pivotal
 event
 and
 are
 designated
 accordingly
 The
 rise
 and
 fall
 of
 dynasties
 the
 birth
 and
 dissolution
 of
 nations
 all
 the
 cycles
 of
 history
 as
 to
 war
 and
 peace
 as
 to
 prosperity
 and
 adversity
 as
 to
 health
 and

 of
 plenty
 and
 of
 famine

 awful
 happenings
 of
 earthquake
 and
 storm
 the
 triumphs
 of
 invention
 and
 discovery
 the
 epochs
 of
 mans
 development
 in
 godliness
 and
 the
 long
 periods
 of
 his
 dwindling
 in
 unbeliefall
 the
 occurrences
 that
 make
 historyare
 chronicled
 throughout
 Christendom
 by
 reference
 to
 the
 year
 before
 or
 after
 the
 birth
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 His
 earthly
 life
 covered
 a
 period
 of
 thirtythree
 years
 and
 of
 these
 but
 three
 were
 spent
 by
 Him
 as
 an
 acknowledged
 Teacher
 openly
 engaged
 in
 the
 activities
 of
 public
 ministry
 He
 was
 brought
 to
 a
 violent
 death
 before
 He
 had
 attained
 what
 we
 now
 regard
 as
 the
 age
 of
 manhoods
 prime
 As
 an
 individual
 He
 was
 personally
 known
 to
 but
 few
 and
 His
 fame
 as
 a
 world
 character
 became
 general
 only
 after
 His
 death
 Brief
 account
 of
 some
 of
 His
 words
 and
 works
 has
 been
 preserved
 to
 us
 and
 this
 record
 fragmentary
 and
 incomplete
 though
 it
 be
 is
 rightly
 esteemed
 as
 the
 worlds
 greatest
 treasure
 The
 earliest
 and
 most
 extended
 history
 of
 His
 mortal
 existence
 is
 embodied
 within
 the
 compilation
 of
 scriptures
 known
 as
 the
 New
 Testament
 indeed
 but
 little
 is
 said
 of
 Him
 by
 secular
 historians
 of
 His
 time
 Few
 and
 short
 as
 are
 the
 allusions
 to
 Him
 made
 by
 nonscriptural
 writers
 in
 the
 period
 immediately
 following
 that
 of
 His
 ministry
 enough
 is
 found
 to
 corroborate
 the
 sacred
 record
 as
 to
 the
 actuality
 and
 period
 of
 Christs
 earthly
 existence
 No
 adequate
 biography
 of
 Jesus
 as
 Boy
 and
 Man
 has
 been
 or
 can
 be
 written
 for
 the
 sufficing
 reason
 that
 a
 fulness
 of
 data
 is
 lacking
 Nevertheless
 man
 never
 lived
 of
 whom
 more
 has
 been
 said
 and
 sung
 none
 to
 whom
 is
 devoted
 a
 greater
 proportion
 of
 the
 worlds
 literature
 He
 is
 extolled
 by
 Christian
 Mohammedan
 and
 Jew
 by
 skeptic
 and
 infidel
 by
 the
 worlds
 greatest
 poets
 philosophers
 statesmen
 scientists
 and
 historian
 Even
 the
 profane
 sinner
 in
 the
 foul
 sacrilege
 of
 his
 oath
 acclaims
 the
 divine
 supremacy
 of
 Him
 whose
 name
 he
 desecrates
 The
 purpose
 of
 the
 present
 treatise
 is
 that
 of
 considering
 the
 life
 and
 mission
 of
 Jesus
 as
 the
 Christ
 In
 this
 undertaking
 we
 are
 to
 be
 guided
 by
 the
 light
 of
 both
 ancient
 and
 modern
 scriptures
 and
 thus
 led
 we
 shall
 discover
 even
 in
 the
 early
 stages
 of
 our
 course
 that
 the
 word
 of
 God
 as
 revealed
 in
 latter
 days
 is
 effective
 in
 illuming
 and
 making
 plain
 the
 Holy
 Writ
 of
 ancient
 times
 and
 this
 in
 many
 matters
 of
 the
 profoundest
 imports
 Instead
 of
 beginning
 our
 study
 with
 the
 earthly
 birth
 of
 the
 Holy
 Babe
 of
 Bethlehem
 we
 shall
 consider
 the
 part
 taken
 by
 the
 Firstborn
 Son
 of
 God
 in
 the
 primeval
 councils
 of
 heaven
 at
 the
 time
 when
 He
 was
 chosen
 and
 ordained
 to
 be
 the
 Savior
 of
 the
 unborn
 race
 of
 mortals
 the
 Redeemer
 of
 a
 world
 then
 in
 its
 formative
 stages
 of
 development
 We
 are
 to
 study
 Him
 as
 the
 Creator
 of
 the
 world
 as
 the
 Word
 of
 Power
 through
 whom
 the
 purposes
 of
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 were
 realized
 in
 the
 preparation
 of
 the
 earth
 for
 the
 abode
 of
 His
 myriad
 spiritchildren
 during
 the
 appointed
 period
 of
 their
 mortal
 probation
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 and
 is
 Jehovah
 the
 God
 of
 Adam
 and
 of
 Noah
 the
 God
 of
 Abraham
 Isaac
 and
 Jacob
 the
 God
 of
 Israel
 the
 God
 at
 whose
 instance
 the
 prophets
 of
 the
 ages
 have
 spoken
 the
 God
 of
 all
 nations
 and
 He
 who
 shall
 yet
 reign
 on
 earth
 as
 King
 of
 kings
 and
 Lord
 of
 lords
 His
 wondrous
 yet
 natural
 birth
 His
 immaculate
 life
 in
 the
 flesh
 and
 His
 voluntary
 death
 as
 a
 consecrated
 sacrifice
 for
 the
 sins
 of
 mankind
 shall
 claim
 our
 reverent
 attention
 as
 shall
 also
 His
 redeeming
 service
 in
 the
 world
 of
 disembodied
 spirits
 His
 literal
 resurrection
 from
 bodily
 death
 to
 immortality
 His
 several
 appearings
 to
 men
 and
 His
 continued
 ministry
 as
 the
 Resurrected
 Lord
 on
 both
 continents
 the
 reestablishment
 of
 His
 Church
 through
 His
 personal
 presence
 and
 that
 of
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 in
 the
 latter
 days
 and
 His
 coming
 to
 His
 temple
 in
 the
 current
 dispensation
 All
 these
 developments
 in
 the
 ministration
 of
 the
 Christ
 are
 already
 of
 the
 past
 Our
 proposed
 course
 of
 investigation
 will
 lead
 yet
 onward
 into
 the
 future
 concerning
 which
 the
 word
 of
 divine
 revelation
 is
 of
 record
 We
 shall
 consider
 the
 conditions
 incident
 to
 the
 Lords
 return
 in
 power
 and
 glory
 to
 inaugurate
 the
 dominion
 of
 the
 Kingdom
 of
 Heaven
 on
 earth
 and
 to
 usher
 in
 the
 predicted
 Millennium
 of
 peace
 and
 righteousness
 And
 yet
 beyond
 we
 shall
 follow
 Him
 through
 the
 postMillennial
 conflict
 between
 the
 powers
 of
 heaven
 and
 the
 forces
 of
 hell
 to
 the
 completion
 of
 His
 victory
 over
 Satan
 sin
 and
 death
 when
 He
 shall
 present
 the
 glorified
 earth
 and
 its
 sanctified
 hosts
 spotless
 and
 celestialized
 unto
 the
 Father
 The
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 of
 Latterday
 Saints
 affirms
 her
 possession
 of
 divine
 authority
 for
 the
 use
 of
 the
 sacred
 name
 Jesus
 Christ
 as
 the
 essential
 part
 of
 her
 distinctive
 designation
 In
 view
 of
 this
 exalted
 claim
 it
 is
 pertinent
 to
 inquire
 as
 to
 what
 special
 or
 particular
 message
 the
 Church
 has
 to
 give
 to
 the
 world
 concerning
 the
 Redeemer
 and
 Savior
 of
 the
 race
 and
 as
 to
 what
 she
 has
 to
 say
 in
 justification
 of
 her
 solemn
 affirmation
 or
 in
 vindication
 of
 her
 exclusive
 name
 and
 title
 As
 we
 proceed
 with
 our
 study
 we
 shall
 find
 that
 among
 the
 specific
 teachings
 of
 the
 Church
 respecting
 the
 Christ
 are
 these
 
 The
 unity
 and
 continuity
 of
 His
 mission
 in
 all
 agesthis
 of
 necessity
 involving
 the
 verity
 of
 His
 preexistence
 and
 foreordination
 
 The
 fact
 of
 His
 antemortal
 Godship
 
 The
 actuality
 of
 His
 birth
 in
 the
 flesh
 as
 the
 natural
 issue
 of
 divine
 and
 mortal
 parentage
 
 The
 reality
 of
 His
 death
 and
 physical
 resurrection
 as
 a
 result
 of
 which
 the
 power
 of
 death
 shall
 be
 eventually
 overcome
 
 The
 literalness
 of
 the
 atonement
 wrought
 by
 Him
 including
 the
 absolute
 requirement
 of
 individual
 compliance
 with
 the
 laws
 and
 ordinances
 of
 His
 gospel
 as
 the
 means
 by
 which
 salvation
 may
 be
 attained
 
 The
 restoration
 of
 His
 Priesthood
 and
 the
 reestablishment
 of
 His
 Church
 in
 the
 current
 age
 which
 is
 verily
 the
 Dispensation
 of
 the
 Fulness
 of
 Times
 
 The
 certainty
 of
 His
 return
 to
 earth
 in
 the
 near
 future
 with
 power
 and
 great
 glory
 to
 reign
 in
 Person
 and
 bodily
 presence
 as
 Lord
 and
 King

 These

 Scriptures

 they

 CHAPTER
 
 PREEXISTENCE
 AND
 FOREORDINATION
 OF
 THE
 CHRIST
 We
 affirm
 on
 the
 authority
 of
 Holy
 Scripture
 that
 the
 Being
 who
 is
 known
 among
 men
 as
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 and
 by
 all
 who
 acknowledge
 His
 Godhood
 as
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 existed
 with
 the
 Father
 prior
 to
 birth
 in
 the
 flesh
 and
 that
 in
 the
 preexistent
 state
 He
 was
 chosen
 and
 ordained
 to
 be
 the
 one
 and
 only
 Savior
 and
 Redeemer
 of
 the
 human
 race
 Foreordination
 implies
 and
 comprizes
 preexistence
 as
 an
 essential
 condition
 therefore
 scriptures
 bearing
 upon
 the
 one
 are
 germane
 to
 the
 other
 and
 consequently
 in
 this
 presentation
 no
 segregation
 of
 evidence
 as
 applying
 specifically
 to
 the
 preexistence
 of
 Christ
 or
 to
 His
 foreordination
 will
 be
 attempted
 John
 the
 Revelator
 beheld
 in
 vision
 some
 of
 the
 scenes
 that
 had
 been
 enacted
 in
 the
 spiritworld
 before
 the
 beginning
 of
 human
 history
 He
 witnessed
 strife
 and
 contention
 between
 loyalty
 and
 rebellion
 with
 the
 hosts
 defending
 the
 former
 led
 by
 Michael
 the
 archangel
 and
 the
 rebellious
 forces
 captained
 by
 Satan
 who
 is
 also
 called
 the
 devil
 the
 serpent
 and
 the
 dragon
 We
 read
 And
 there
 was
 war
 in
 heaven
 Michael
 and
 his
 angels
 fought
 against
 the
 dragon
 and
 the
 dragon
 fought
 and
 his
 angels
 In
 this
 struggle
 between
 unembodied
 hosts
 the
 forces
 were
 unequally
 divided
 Satan
 drew
 to
 his
 standard
 only
 a
 third
 part
 of
 the
 children
 of
 God
 who
 are
 symbolized
 as
 the
 stars
 of
 heaven
 the
 majority
 either
 fought
 with
 Michael
 or
 at
 least
 refrained
 from
 active
 opposition
 thus
 accomplishing
 the
 purpose
 of
 their
 first
 estate
 while
 the
 angels
 who
 arrayed
 themselves
 on
 the
 side
 of
 Satan
 kept
 not
 their
 first
 estate
 and
 therefore
 rendered
 themselves
 ineligible
 for
 the
 glorious
 possibilities
 of
 an
 advanced
 condition
 or
 second
 estate
 The
 victory
 was
 with
 Michael
 and
 his
 angels
 and
 Satan
 or
 Lucifer
 theretofore
 a
 son
 of
 the
 morning
 was
 cast
 out
 of
 heaven
 yea
 he
 was
 cast
 out
 into
 the
 earth
 and
 his
 angels
 were
 cast
 out
 with
 him
 The
 prophet
 Isaiah
 to
 whom
 these
 momentous
 occurrences
 had
 been
 revealed
 about
 eight
 centuries
 prior
 to
 the
 time
 of
 Johns
 writings
 laments
 with
 inspired
 pathos
 the
 fall
 of
 so
 great
 a
 one
 and
 specifies
 selfish
 ambition
 as
 the
 occasion
 How
 art
 thou
 fallen
 from
 heaven
 O
 Lucifer
 son
 of
 the
 morning
 how
 art
 thou
 cut
 down
 to
 the
 ground
 which
 didst
 weaken
 the
 nations
 For
 thou
 hast
 said
 in
 thine
 heart
 I
 will
 ascent
 into
 heaven
 I
 will
 exalt
 my
 throne
 above
 the
 stars
 of
 God
 I
 will
 sit
 also
 upon
 the
 mount
 of
 the
 congregation
 in
 the
 sides
 of
 the
 north
 I
 will
 ascend
 above
 the
 heights
 of
 the
 clouds
 I
 will
 be
 like
 the
 most
 High
 Yet
 thou
 shalt
 be
 brought
 down
 to
 hell
 to
 the
 sides
 of
 the
 pit
 Justification
 for
 citing
 these
 scriptures
 in
 connection
 with
 our
 present
 consideration
 will
 be
 found
 in
 the
 cause
 of
 the
 great
 contentionthe
 conditions
 that
 led
 to
 this
 war
 in
 heaven
 It
 is
 plain
 from
 the
 words
 of
 Isaiah
 that
 Lucifer
 already
 of
 exalted
 rank
 sought
 to
 aggrandize
 himself
 without
 regard
 to
 the
 rights
 and
 agency
 of
 others
 The
 matter
 is
 set
 forth
 in
 words
 that
 none
 may
 misapprehend
 in
 a
 revelation
 given
 to
 Moses
 and
 repeated
 through
 the
 first
 prophet
 of
 the
 present
 dispensation
 And
 I
 the
 Lord
 God
 spake
 unto
 Moses
 saying
 That
 Satan
 whom
 thou
 hast
 commanded
 in
 the
 name
 of
 mine
 Only
 Begotten
 is
 the
 same
 which
 was
 from
 the
 beginning
 and
 he
 came
 before
 me
 sayingBehold
 here
 am
 I
 send
 me
 I
 will
 be
 thy
 son
 and
 I
 will
 redeem
 all
 mankind
 that
 one
 soul
 shall
 not
 be
 lost
 and
 surely
 I
 will
 do
 it
 wherefore
 give
 me
 thine
 honor
 But
 behold
 my
 Beloved
 son
 which
 was
 my
 Beloved
 and
 Chosen
 from
 the
 beginning
 said
 unto
 meFather
 thy
 will
 be
 done
 and
 the
 glory
 be
 thine
 forever
 Wherefore
 because
 that
 Satan
 rebelled
 against
 me
 and
 sought
 to
 destroy
 the
 agency
 of
 man
 which
 I
 the
 Lord
 God
 had
 given
 him
 and
 also
 that
 I
 should
 give
 unto
 him
 mine
 own
 power
 by
 the
 power
 of
 mine
 Only
 Begotten
 I
 caused
 that
 he
 should
 be
 cast
 down
 and
 he
 became
 Satan
 yea
 even
 the
 devil
 the
 father
 of
 all
 lies
 to
 deceive
 and
 to
 blind
 men
 and
 to
 lead
 them
 captive
 at
 his
 will
 even
 as
 many
 as
 would
 not
 hearken
 unto
 my
 voice
 Thus
 it
 is
 shown
 that
 prior
 to
 the
 placing
 of
 man
 upon
 the
 earth
 how
 long
 before
 we
 do
 not
 know
 Christ
 and
 Satan
 together
 with
 the
 hosts
 of
 the
 spiritchildren
 of
 God
 existed
 as
 intelligent
 individuals
 possessing
 power
 and
 opportunity
 to
 choose
 the
 course
 they
 would
 pursue
 and
 the
 leaders
 whom
 they
 would
 follow
 and
 obey
 In
 that
 great
 concourse
 of
 spiritintelligences
 the
 Fathers
 plan
 whereby
 His
 children
 would
 be
 advanced
 to
 their
 second
 estate
 was
 submitted
 and
 doubtless
 discussed
 The
 opportunity
 so
 placed
 within
 the
 reach
 of
 the
 spirits
 who
 were
 to
 be
 privileged
 to
 take
 bodies
 upon
 the
 earth
 was
 so
 transcendently
 glorious
 that
 those
 heavenly
 multitudes
 burst
 forth
 into
 song
 and
 shouted
 for
 joy
 Satans
 plan
 of
 compulsion
 whereby
 all
 would
 be
 safely
 conducted
 through
 the
 career
 of
 mortality
 bereft
 of
 freedom
 to
 act
 and
 agency
 to
 choose
 so
 circumscribed
 that
 they
 would
 be
 compelled
 to
 do
 rightthat
 one
 soul
 would
 not
 be
 lostwas
 rejected
 and
 the
 humble
 offer
 of
 Jesus
 the
 Firstbornto
 assume
 mortality
 and
 live
 among
 men
 as
 their
 Exemplar
 and
 Teacher
 observing
 the
 sanctity
 of
 mans
 agency
 but
 teaching
 men
 to
 use
 aright
 that
 divine
 heritagewas
 accepted
 The
 decision
 brought
 war
 which
 resulted
 in
 the
 vanquishment
 of
 Satan
 and
 his
 angels
 who
 were
 cast
 out
 and
 deprived
 of
 the
 boundless
 privileges
 incident
 to
 the
 mortal
 or
 second
 estate
 In
 that
 august
 council
 of
 the
 angels
 and
 the
 Gods
 the
 Being
 who
 later
 was
 born
 in
 flesh
 as
 Marys
 Son
 Jesus
 took
 prominent
 part
 and
 there
 was
 He
 ordained
 of
 the
 Father
 to
 be
 the
 Savior
 of
 mankind
 As
 to
 time
 the
 term
 being
 used
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 all
 duration
 past
 this
 is
 our
 earliest
 record
 of
 the
 Firstborn
 among
 the
 sons
 of
 God
 to
 us
 who
 read
 it
 marks
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 written
 history
 of
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 Old
 Testament
 scriptures
 while
 abounding
 in
 promises
 relating
 to
 the
 actuality
 of
 Christs
 advent
 in
 the
 flesh
 are
 less
 specific
 in
 information
 concerning
 His
 antemortal
 existence
 By
 the
 children
 of
 Israel
 while
 living
 under
 the
 law
 and
 still
 unprepared
 to
 receive
 the
 gospel
 the
 Messiah
 was
 looked
 for
 as
 one
 to
 be
 born
 in
 the
 lineage
 of
 Abraham
 and
 David
 empowered
 to
 deliver
 them
 from
 personal
 and
 national
 burdens
 and
 to
 vanquish
 their
 enemies
 The
 actuality
 of
 the
 Messiahs
 status
 as
 the
 chosen
 Son
 of
 God
 who
 was
 with
 the
 Father
 from
 the
 beginning
 a
 Being
 of
 preexistent
 power
 and
 glory
 was
 but
 dimly
 perceived
 if
 conceived
 at
 all
 by
 the
 people
 in
 general
 and
 although
 to
 prophets
 specially
 commissioned
 in
 the
 authorities
 and
 privileges
 of
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 revelation
 of
 the
 great
 truth
 was
 given
 they
 transmitted
 it
 to
 the
 people
 rather
 in
 the
 language
 of
 imagery
 and
 parable
 than
 in
 words
 of
 direct
 plainness
 Nevertheless
 the
 testimony
 of
 the
 evangelists
 and
 the
 apostles
 the
 attestation
 of
 the
 Christ
 Himself
 while
 in
 the
 flesh
 and
 the
 revelations
 given
 in
 the
 present
 dispensation
 leave
 us
 without
 dearth
 of
 scriptural
 proof
 In
 the
 opening
 lines
 of
 the
 Gospel
 book
 written
 by
 John
 the
 apostle
 we
 read
 In
 the
 beginning
 was
 the
 Word
 and
 the
 word
 was
 with
 God
 and
 the
 word
 was
 God
 The
 same
 was
 in
 the
 beginning
 with
 God
 All
 things
 were
 made
 by
 him
 and
 without
 him
 was
 not
 anything
 made
 that
 was
 made
 And
 the
 Word
 was
 made
 flesh
 and
 dwelt
 among
 us
 and
 we
 beheld
 his
 glory
 the
 glory
 as
 of
 the
 only
 begotten
 of
 the
 Father
 full
 of
 grace
 and
 truth
 The
 passage
 is
 simple
 precise
 and
 unambiguous
 We
 may
 reasonably
 give
 to
 the
 phrase
 In
 the
 beginning
 the
 same
 meaning
 as
 attaches
 thereto
 in
 the
 first
 line
 of
 Genesis
 and
 such
 signification
 must
 indicate
 a
 time
 antecedent
 to
 the
 earliest
 stages
 of
 human
 existence
 upon
 the
 earth
 That
 the
 Word
 is
 Jesus
 Christ
 who
 was
 with
 the
 Father
 in
 that
 beginning
 and
 who
 was
 Himself
 invested
 with
 the
 powers
 and
 rank
 of
 Godship
 and
 that
 He
 came
 into
 the
 world
 and
 dwelt
 among
 men
 are
 definitely
 affirmed
 These
 statements
 are
 corroborated
 through
 a
 revelation
 given
 to
 Moses
 in
 which
 he
 was
 permitted
 to
 see
 many
 of
 the
 creations
 of
 God
 and
 to
 hear
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 Father
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 things
 that
 had
 been
 made
 And
 by
 the
 word
 of
 my
 power
 have
 I
 created
 them
 which
 is
 mine
 Only
 Begotten
 Son
 who
 is
 full
 of
 grace
 and
 truth
 John
 the
 apostle
 repeatedly
 affirms
 the
 preexistence
 of
 the
 Christ
 and
 the
 fact
 of
 His
 authority
 and
 power
 in
 the
 antemortal
 state
 To
 the
 same
 effect
 is
 the
 testimony
 of
 Paul
 and
 of
 Peter
 Instructing
 the
 saints
 concerning
 the
 basis
 of
 their
 faith
 the
 lastnamed
 apostle
 impressed
 upon
 them
 that
 their
 redemption
 was
 not
 to
 be
 secured
 through
 corruptible
 things
 nor
 by
 the
 outward
 observance
 of
 traditional
 requirements
 But
 with
 the
 precious
 blood
 of
 Christ
 as
 of
 a
 lamb
 without
 blemish
 and
 without
 spot
 who
 verily
 was
 foreordained
 before
 the
 foundation
 of
 the
 world
 but
 was
 manifest
 in
 these
 last
 times
 for
 you
 Even
 more
 impressive
 and
 yet
 more
 truly
 conclusive
 are
 the
 personal
 testimonies
 of
 the
 Savior
 as
 to
 His
 own
 preexistent
 life
 and
 the
 mission
 among
 men
 to
 which
 He
 had
 been
 appointed
 No
 one
 who
 accepts
 Jesus
 as
 the
 Messiah
 can
 consistently
 reject
 these
 evidences
 of
 His
 eternal
 nature
 When
 on
 a
 certain
 occasion
 the
 Jews
 in
 the
 synagogue
 disputed
 among
 themselves
 and
 murmured
 because
 of
 their
 failure
 to
 understand
 aright
 His
 doctrine
 concerning
 Himself
 especially
 as
 touching
 His
 relationship
 with
 the
 Father
 Jesus
 said
 unto
 them
 For
 I
 came
 down
 from
 heaven
 not
 to
 do
 mine
 own
 will
 but
 the
 will
 of
 him
 that
 sent
 me
 And
 then
 continuing
 the
 lesson
 based
 upon
 the
 contrast
 between
 the
 manna
 with
 which
 their
 fathers
 had
 been
 fed
 in
 the
 wilderness
 and
 the
 bread
 of
 life
 which
 He
 had
 to
 offer
 He
 added
 I
 am
 the
 living
 bread
 which
 came
 down
 from
 heaven
 and
 again
 declared
 the
 living
 Father
 hath
 sent
 me
 Not
 a
 few
 of
 the
 disciples
 failed
 to
 comprehend
 His
 teachings
 and
 their
 complaints
 drew
 from
 Him
 these
 words
 Doth
 this
 offend
 you
 What
 and
 if
 ye
 shall
 see
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 ascend
 up
 where
 he
 was
 before
 To
 certain
 wicked
 Jews
 wrapped
 in
 the
 mantle
 of
 racial
 pride
 boastful
 of
 their
 descent
 through
 the
 lineage
 of
 Abraham
 and
 seeking
 to
 excuse
 their
 sins
 through
 an
 unwarranted
 use
 of
 the
 great
 patriarchs
 name
 our
 Lord
 thus
 proclaimed
 His
 own
 preeminence
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Before
 Abraham
 was
 I
 am
 The
 fuller
 significance
 of
 this
 remark
 will
 be
 treated
 later
 suffice
 it
 in
 the
 present
 connection
 to
 consider
 this
 scripture
 as
 a
 plain
 avowal
 of
 our
 Lords
 seniority
 and
 supremacy
 over
 Abraham
 But
 as
 Abrahams
 birth
 had
 preceded
 that
 of
 Christ
 by
 more
 than
 nineteen
 centuries
 such
 seniority
 must
 have
 reference
 to
 a
 state
 of
 existence
 antedating
 that
 of
 mortality
 When
 the
 hour
 of
 His
 betrayal
 was
 near
 in
 the
 last
 interview
 with
 the
 apostles
 prior
 to
 His
 agonizing
 experience
 in
 Gethsemane
 Jesus
 comforted
 them
 saying
 For
 the
 Father
 himself
 loveth
 you
 because
 ye
 have
 loved
 me
 and
 have
 believed
 that
 I
 came
 out
 from
 God
 I
 came
 forth
 from
 the
 Father
 and
 am
 come
 into
 the
 world
 again
 I
 leave
 the
 world
 and
 go
 to
 the
 Father
 Furthermore
 in
 the
 course
 of
 upwelling
 prayer
 for
 those
 who
 had
 been
 true
 to
 their
 testimony
 of
 His
 Messiahship
 He
 addressed
 the
 Father
 with
 this
 solemn
 invocation
 And
 this
 is
 the
 life
 eternal
 that
 they
 might
 know
 thee
 the
 only
 true
 God
 and
 Jesus
 Christ
 whom
 thou
 hast
 sent
 I
 have
 glorified
 thee
 on
 the
 earth
 I
 have
 finished
 the
 work
 which
 thou
 gavest
 me
 to
 do
 And
 now
 O
 Father
 glorify
 thou
 with
 thine
 own
 self
 with
 the
 glory
 which
 I
 had
 with
 thee
 before
 the
 world
 was
 Book
 of
 Mormon
 scriptures
 are
 likewise
 explicit
 in
 proof
 of
 the
 preexistence
 of
 the
 Christ
 and
 of
 His
 foreappointed
 mission
 One
 only
 of
 the
 many
 evidences
 therein
 found
 will
 be
 cited
 here
 An
 ancient
 prophet
 designated
 in
 the
 record
 as
 the
 brother
 of
 Jared
 once
 pleaded
 with
 the
 Lord
 in
 special
 supplication
 And
 the
 Lord
 said
 unto
 him
 Believest
 thou
 the
 words
 which
 I
 shall
 speak
 And
 he
 answered
 Yea
 Lord
 I
 know
 that
 thou
 speakest
 the
 truth
 for
 thou
 art
 a
 God
 of
 truth
 and
 canst
 not
 lie
 And
 when
 he
 had
 said
 these
 words
 behold
 the
 Lord
 shewed
 himself
 unto
 him
 and
 said
 Because
 thou
 knowest
 these
 things
 ye
 are
 redeemed
 from
 the
 fall
 therefore
 ye
 are
 brought
 back
 into
 my
 presence
 therefore
 I
 shew
 myself
 unto
 you
 Behold
 I
 am
 he
 who
 was
 prepared
 from
 the
 foundation
 of
 the
 world
 to
 redeem
 my
 people
 Behold
 I
 am
 Jesus
 Christ
 I
 am
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Son
 In
 me
 shall
 all
 mankind
 have
 light
 and
 that
 eternally
 even
 they
 who
 shall
 believe
 on
 my
 name
 and
 they
 shall
 become
 my
 sons
 and
 my
 daughters
 And
 never
 have
 I
 shewed
 myself
 unto
 man
 whom
 I
 have
 created
 for
 never
 has
 man
 believed
 in
 me
 as
 thou
 hast
 Seest
 thou
 that
 ye
 are
 created
 after
 mine
 own
 image
 Yea
 even
 all
 men
 were
 created
 in
 the
 beginning
 after
 mine
 own
 image
 Behold
 this
 body
 which
 ye
 now
 behold
 is
 the
 body
 of
 my
 spirit
 and
 man
 have
 I
 created
 after
 the
 body
 of
 my
 spirit
 and
 even
 as
 I
 appear
 unto
 thee
 to
 be
 in
 the
 spirit
 will
 I
 appear
 unto
 my
 people
 in
 the
 flesh
 The
 main
 facts
 attested
 by
 this
 scripture
 as
 having
 a
 direct
 bearing
 upon
 our
 present
 subject
 are
 those
 of
 the
 Christ
 manifesting
 Himself
 while
 yet
 in
 His
 antemortal
 state
 and
 of
 His
 declaration
 that
 He
 had
 been
 chosen
 from
 the
 foundation
 of
 the
 world
 as
 the
 Redeemer
 Revelation
 given
 through
 the
 prophets
 of
 God
 in
 the
 present
 dispensation
 is
 replete
 with
 evidence
 of
 Christs
 appointment
 and
 ordination
 in
 the
 primeval
 world
 and
 the
 whole
 tenor
 of
 the
 scriptures
 contained
 in
 the
 Doctrine
 and
 Covenants
 may
 be
 called
 in
 witness
 The
 following
 instances
 are
 particularly
 in
 point
 In
 a
 communication
 to
 Joseph
 Smith
 the
 prophet
 in
 May
 
 the
 Lord
 declared
 Himself
 as
 the
 One
 who
 had
 previously
 come
 into
 the
 world
 from
 the
 Father
 and
 of
 whom
 John
 had
 borne
 testimony
 as
 the
 Word
 and
 the
 solemn
 truth
 is
 reiterated
 that
 He
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 in
 the
 beginning
 before
 the
 world
 was
 and
 further
 that
 He
 was
 the
 Redeemer
 who
 came
 into
 the
 world
 because
 the
 world
 was
 made
 by
 him
 and
 in
 him
 was
 the
 life
 of
 men
 and
 the
 light
 of
 men
 Again
 He
 is
 referred
 to
 as
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 of
 the
 Father
 full
 of
 grace
 and
 truth
 even
 the
 Spirit
 of
 truth
 which
 came
 and
 dwelt
 in
 the
 flesh
 In
 the
 course
 of
 the
 same
 revelation
 the
 Lord
 said
 And
 now
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 I
 was
 in
 the
 beginning
 with
 the
 Father
 and
 am
 the
 firstborn
 On
 an
 earlier
 occasion
 as
 the
 modern
 prophet
 testifies
 he
 and
 an
 associate
 in
 the
 priesthood
 were
 enlightened
 by
 the
 Spirit
 so
 that
 they
 were
 able
 to
 see
 and
 understand
 the
 things
 of
 GodEven
 those
 things
 which
 were
 from
 the
 beginning
 before
 the
 world
 was
 which
 were
 ordained
 of
 the
 Father
 through
 his
 Only
 Begotten
 Son
 who
 was
 in
 the
 bosom
 of
 the
 Father
 even
 from
 the
 beginning
 of
 whom
 we
 bear
 record
 and
 the
 record
 which
 we
 bear
 is
 the
 fulness
 of
 the
 gospel
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 who
 is
 the
 Son
 whom
 we
 saw
 and
 with
 whom
 we
 conversed
 in
 the
 heavenly
 vision
 The
 testimony
 of
 scriptures
 written
 on
 both
 hemispheres
 that
 of
 records
 both
 ancient
 and
 modern
 the
 inspired
 utterances
 of
 prophets
 and
 apostles
 and
 the
 words
 of
 the
 Lord
 Himself
 are
 of
 one
 voice
 in
 proclaiming
 the
 preexistence
 of
 the
 Christ
 and
 His
 ordination
 as
 the
 chosen
 Savior
 and
 Redeemer
 of
 mankindin
 the
 beginning
 yea
 even
 before
 the
 foundation
 of
 the
 world
 NOTES
 TO
 CHAPTER
 
 
 Graded
 Intelligences
 in
 the
 Antemortal
 StateThat
 the
 spirits
 of
 men
 existed
 as
 individual
 intelligences
 of
 varying
 degrees
 of
 ability
 and
 power
 prior
 to
 the
 inauguration
 of
 the
 mortal
 state
 upon
 this
 earth
 and
 even
 prior
 to
 the
 creation
 of
 the
 world
 as
 a
 suitable
 abode
 for
 human
 beings
 is
 shown
 in
 great
 plainness
 through
 a
 divine
 revelation
 to
 Abraham
 Now
 the
 Lord
 had
 shown
 unto
 me
 Abraham
 the
 intelligences
 that
 were
 organized
 before
 the
 world
 was
 and
 among
 all
 these
 there
 were
 many
 of
 the
 noble
 and
 great
 ones
 and
 God
 saw
 these
 souls
 that
 they
 were
 good
 and
 he
 stood
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 them
 and
 he
 said
 These
 I
 will
 make
 my
 rulers
 for
 he
 stood
 among
 those
 that
 were
 spirits
 and
 he
 saw
 that
 they
 were
 good
 and
 he
 said
 unto
 me
 Abraham
 thou
 art
 one
 of
 them
 thou
 wast
 chosen
 before
 thou
 wast
 born
 P
 of
 GP
 Abraham
 
 
 That
 both
 Christ
 and
 Satan
 were
 among
 those
 exalted
 intelligences
 and
 that
 Christ
 was
 chosen
 while
 Satan
 was
 rejected
 as
 the
 future
 Savior
 of
 mankind
 are
 shown
 by
 the
 portions
 of
 the
 revelation
 immediately
 following
 that
 above
 quoted
 And
 there
 stood
 one
 among
 them
 that
 was
 like
 unto
 God
 and
 he
 said
 unto
 those
 who
 were
 with
 him
 We
 will
 go
 down
 for
 there
 is
 space
 there
 and
 we
 will
 take
 of
 these
 materials
 and
 we
 will
 make
 an
 earth
 whereon
 these
 may
 dwell
 and
 we
 will
 prove
 them
 herewith
 to
 see
 if
 they
 will
 do
 all
 things
 whatsoever
 the
 Lord
 their
 God
 shall
 command
 them
 and
 they
 who
 keep
 their
 first
 estate
 shall
 be
 added
 upon
 and
 they
 who
 keep
 not
 their
 first
 estate
 shall
 not
 have
 glory
 in
 the
 same
 kingdom
 with
 those
 who
 keep
 their
 first
 estate
 and
 they
 who
 keep
 their
 second
 estate
 shall
 have
 glory
 added
 upon
 their
 heads
 forever
 and
 ever
 And
 the
 Lord
 said
 Whom
 shall
 I
 send
 And
 one
 answered
 like
 unto
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 Here
 am
 I
 send
 me
 And
 another
 answered
 and
 said
 Here
 am
 I
 send
 me
 And
 the
 Lord
 said
 I
 will
 send
 the
 first
 And
 the
 second
 was
 angry
 and
 kept
 not
 his
 first
 estate
 and
 at
 that
 day
 many
 followed
 after
 him
 verses
 
 
 The
 Primeval
 Council
 in
 the
 HeavensIt
 is
 definitely
 stated
 in
 the
 Book
 of
 Genesis
 that
 God
 said
 Let
 us
 make
 man
 in
 our
 image
 after
 our
 likeness
 and
 again
 after
 Adam
 had
 taken
 of
 the
 forbidden
 fruit
 the
 Lord
 said
 Behold
 the
 man
 has
 become
 as
 one
 of
 us
 and
 the
 inference
 is
 direct
 that
 in
 all
 that
 related
 to
 the
 work
 of
 the
 creation
 of
 the
 world
 there
 was
 a
 consultation
 and
 though
 God
 spake
 as
 it
 is
 recorded
 in
 the
 Bible
 yet
 it
 is
 evident
 He
 counseled
 with
 others
 The
 scriptures
 tell
 us
 there
 are
 Gods
 many
 and
 Lords
 many
 But
 to
 us
 there
 is
 but
 one
 God
 the
 Father
 
 Cor
 
 And
 for
 this
 reason
 though
 there
 were
 others
 engaged
 in
 the
 creation
 of
 the
 worlds
 it
 is
 given
 to
 us
 in
 the
 Bible
 in
 the
 shape
 that
 it
 is
 for
 the
 fulness
 of
 these
 truths
 is
 only
 revealed
 to
 highly
 favored
 persons
 for
 certain
 reasons
 known
 to
 God
 as
 we
 are
 told
 in
 the
 scriptures
 The
 secret
 of
 the
 Lord
 is
 with
 them
 that
 fear
 him
 and
 he
 will
 show
 them
 his
 covenantPsalms
 
 It
 is
 consistent
 to
 believe
 that
 at
 this
 Council
 in
 the
 heavens
 the
 plan
 that
 should
 be
 adopted
 in
 relation
 to
 the
 sons
 of
 God
 who
 were
 then
 spirits
 and
 had
 not
 yet
 obtained
 tabernacles
 was
 duly
 considered
 For
 in
 view
 of
 the
 creation
 of
 the
 world
 and
 the
 placing
 of
 men
 upon
 it
 whereby
 it
 would
 be
 possible
 for
 them
 to
 obtain
 tabernacles
 and
 in
 those
 tabernacles
 obey
 laws
 of
 life
 and
 with
 them
 again
 be
 exalted
 among
 the
 Gods
 we
 are
 told
 that
 at
 that
 time
 the
 morning
 stars
 sang
 together
 and
 all
 the
 sons
 of
 God
 shouted
 for
 joy
 The
 question
 then
 arose
 how
 and
 upon
 what
 principle
 should
 the
 salvation
 exaltation
 and
 eternal
 glory
 of
 Gods
 sons
 be
 brought
 about
 It
 is
 evident
 that
 at
 that
 Council
 certain
 plans
 had
 been
 proposed
 and
 discussed
 and
 that
 after
 a
 full
 discussion
 of
 those
 principles
 and
 the
 declaration
 of
 the
 Fathers
 will
 pertaining
 to
 His
 design
 Lucifer
 came
 before
 the
 Father
 with
 a
 plan
 of
 his
 own
 saying
 Behold
 here
 am
 I
 send
 me
 I
 will
 be
 thy
 son
 and
 I
 will
 redeem
 all
 mankind
 that
 one
 soul
 shall
 not
 be
 lost
 and
 surely
 I
 will
 do
 it
 wherefore
 give
 me
 thine
 honor
 But
 Jesus
 on
 hearing
 this
 statement
 made
 by
 Lucifer
 said
 Father
 thy
 will
 be
 done
 and
 the
 glory
 be
 thine
 forever
 From
 these
 remarks
 made
 by
 the
 well
 beloved
 Son
 we
 should
 naturally
 infer
 that
 in
 the
 discussion
 of
 this
 subject
 the
 Father
 had
 made
 known
 His
 will
 and
 developed
 His
 plan
 and
 design
 pertaining
 to
 these
 matters
 and
 all
 that
 His
 well
 beloved
 Son
 wanted
 to
 do
 was
 to
 carry
 out
 the
 will
 of
 His
 Father
 as
 it
 would
 appear
 had
 been
 before
 expressed
 He
 also
 wished
 the
 glory
 to
 be
 given
 to
 His
 Father
 who
 as
 God
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 originator
 and
 designer
 of
 the
 plan
 had
 a
 right
 to
 all
 the
 honor
 and
 glory
 But
 Lucifer
 wanted
 to
 introduce
 a
 plan
 contrary
 to
 the
 will
 of
 his
 Father
 and
 then
 wanted
 His
 honor
 and
 said
 I
 will
 save
 every
 soul
 of
 man
 wherefore
 give
 me
 thine
 honor
 He
 wanted
 to
 go
 contrary
 to
 the
 will
 of
 his
 Father
 and
 presumptuously
 sought
 to
 deprive
 man
 of
 his
 free
 agency
 thus
 making
 him
 a
 serf
 and
 placing
 him
 in
 a
 position
 in
 which
 it
 was
 impossible
 for
 him
 to
 obtain
 that
 exaltation
 which
 God
 designed
 should
 be
 mans
 through
 obedience
 to
 the
 law
 which
 He
 had
 suggested
 and
 again
 Lucifer
 wanted
 the
 honor
 and
 power
 of
 his
 Father
 to
 enable
 him
 to
 carry
 out
 principles
 which
 were
 contrary
 to
 the
 Fathers
 wishJohn

 The
 JareditesOf
 the
 two
 nations
 whose
 histories
 constitute
 the
 Book
 of
 Mormon
 the
 first
 in
 order
 of
 time
 consisted
 of
 the
 people
 of
 Jared
 who
 followed
 their
 leader
 from
 the
 Tower
 of
 Babel
 at
 the
 time
 of
 the
 confusion
 of
 tongues
 Their
 history
 was
 written
 on
 twentyfour
 plates
 of
 gold
 by
 Ether
 the
 last
 of
 their
 prophets
 who
 foreseeing
 the
 destruction
 of
 his
 people
 because
 of
 their
 wickedness
 hid
 away
 the
 historical
 plates
 They
 were
 afterward
 found
 BC
 
 by
 an
 expedition
 sent
 out
 by
 King
 Limhi
 a
 Nephite
 ruler
 The
 record
 engraved
 on
 these
 plates
 was
 subsequently
 abridged
 by
 Moroni
 and
 the
 condensed
 account
 was
 attached
 by
 him
 to
 the
 Book
 of
 Mormon
 record
 it
 appears
 in
 the
 modern
 translation
 under
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Book
 of
 Ether
 The
 first
 and
 chief
 prophet
 of
 the
 Jaredites
 is
 not
 mentioned
 by
 name
 in
 the
 record
 as
 we
 have
 it
 he
 is
 known
 only
 as
 the
 brother
 of
 Jared
 Of
 the
 people
 we
 learn
 that
 amid
 the
 confusion
 of
 Babel
 Jared
 and
 his
 brother
 importuned
 the
 Lord
 that
 He
 would
 spare
 them
 and
 their
 associates
 from
 the
 impending
 disruption
 Their
 prayer
 was
 heard
 and
 the
 Lord
 led
 them
 with
 a
 considerable
 company
 who
 like
 themselves
 were
 free
 from
 the
 taint
 of
 idolatry
 away
 from
 their
 homes
 promising
 to
 conduct
 them
 to
 a
 land
 choice
 above
 all
 other
 lands
 Their
 course
 of
 travel
 is
 not
 given
 with
 exactness
 we
 learn
 only
 that
 they
 reached
 the
 ocean
 and
 there
 constructed
 eight
 vessels
 called
 barges
 in
 which
 they
 set
 out
 upon
 the
 waters
 These
 vessels
 were
 small
 and
 dark
 within
 but
 the
 Lord
 made
 luminous
 certain
 stones
 which
 gave
 light
 to
 the
 imprisoned
 voyagers
 After
 a
 passage
 of
 three
 hundred
 and
 fortyfour
 days
 the
 colony
 landed
 on
 the
 western
 shore
 of
 North
 America
 probably
 at
 a
 place
 south
 of
 the
 Gulf
 of
 California
 and
 north
 of
 the
 Isthmus
 of
 Panama
 Here
 they
 became
 a
 flourishing
 nation
 but
 giving
 way
 in
 time
 to
 internal
 dissensions
 they
 divided
 into
 factions
 which
 warred
 with
 one
 another
 until
 the
 people
 were
 totally
 destroyed
 This
 destruction
 which
 occurred
 near
 the
 hill
 Ramah
 afterward
 known
 among
 the
 Nephites
 as
 Cumorah
 probably
 took
 place
 at
 about
 the
 time
 of
 Lehis
 landing
 in
 South
 America

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 NEED
 OF
 A
 REDEEMER
 We
 have
 heretofore
 shown
 that
 the
 entire
 human
 race
 existed
 as
 spiritbeings
 in
 the
 primeval
 world
 and
 that
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 making
 possible
 to
 them
 the
 experiences
 of
 mortality
 this
 earth
 was
 created
 They
 were
 endowed
 with
 the
 powers
 of
 agency
 or
 choice
 while
 yet
 but
 spirits
 and
 the
 divine
 plan
 provided
 that
 they
 be
 freeborn
 in
 the
 flesh
 heirs
 to
 the
 inalienable
 birthright
 of
 liberty
 to
 choose
 and
 to
 act
 for
 themselves
 in
 mortality
 It
 is
 undeniably
 essential
 to
 the
 eternal
 progression
 of
 Gods
 children
 that
 they
 be
 subjected
 to
 the
 influences
 of
 both
 good
 and
 evil
 that
 they
 be
 tried
 and
 tested
 and
 proved
 withal
 to
 see
 if
 they
 will
 do
 all
 things
 whatsoever
 the
 Lord
 their
 God
 shall
 command
 them
 Free
 agency
 is
 an
 indispensable
 element
 of
 such
 a
 test
 The
 Eternal
 Father
 well
 understood
 the
 diverse
 natures
 and
 varied
 capacities
 of
 His
 spiritoffspring
 and
 His
 infinite
 foreknowledge
 made
 plain
 to
 Him
 even
 in
 the
 beginning
 that
 in
 the
 school
 of
 life
 some
 of
 His
 children
 would
 succeed
 and
 others
 would
 fail
 some
 would
 be
 faithful
 others
 false
 some
 would
 choose
 the
 good
 others
 the
 evil
 some
 would
 seek
 the
 way
 of
 life
 while
 others
 would
 elect
 to
 follow
 the
 road
 to
 destruction
 He
 further
 foresaw
 that
 death
 would
 enter
 the
 world
 and
 that
 the
 possession
 of
 bodies
 by
 His
 children
 would
 be
 of
 but
 brief
 individual
 duration
 He
 saw
 that
 His
 commandments
 would
 be
 disobeyed
 and
 His
 law
 violated
 and
 that
 men
 shut
 out
 from
 His
 presence
 and
 left
 to
 themselves
 would
 sink
 rather
 than
 rise
 would
 retrograde
 rather
 than
 advance
 and
 would
 be
 lost
 to
 the
 heavens
 It
 was
 necessary
 that
 a
 means
 of
 redemption
 be
 provided
 whereby
 erring
 man
 might
 make
 amends
 and
 by
 compliance
 with
 established
 law
 achieve
 salvation
 and
 eventual
 exaltation
 in
 the
 eternal
 worlds
 The
 power
 of
 death
 was
 to
 be
 overcome
 so
 that
 though
 men
 would
 of
 necessity
 die
 they
 would
 live
 anew
 their
 spirits
 clothed
 with
 immortalized
 bodies
 over
 which
 death
 could
 not
 again
 prevail
 Let
 not
 ignorance
 and
 thoughtlessness
 lead
 us
 into
 the
 error
 of
 assuming
 that
 the
 Fathers
 foreknowledge
 as
 to
 what
 would
 be
 under
 given
 conditions
 determined
 that
 such
 must
 be
 It
 was
 not
 His
 design
 that
 the
 souls
 of
 mankind
 be
 lost
 on
 the
 contrary
 it
 was
 and
 is
 His
 work
 and
 glory
 to
 bring
 to
 pass
 the
 immortality
 and
 eternal
 life
 of
 man
 Nevertheless
 He
 saw
 the
 evil
 into
 which
 His
 children
 would
 assuredly
 fall
 and
 with
 infinite
 love
 and
 mercy
 did
 He
 ordain
 means
 of
 averting
 the
 dire
 effect
 provided
 the
 transgressor
 would
 elect
 to
 avail
 himself
 thereof
 The
 offer
 of
 the
 firstborn
 Son
 to
 establish
 through
 His
 own
 ministry
 among
 men
 the
 gospel
 of
 salvation
 and
 to
 sacrifice
 Himself
 through
 labor
 humiliation
 and
 suffering
 even
 unto
 death
 was
 accepted
 and
 made
 the
 foreordained
 plan
 of
 mans
 redemption
 from
 death
 of
 his
 eventual
 salvation
 from
 the
 effects
 of
 sin
 and
 of
 his
 possible
 exaltation
 through
 righteous
 achievement
 In
 accordance
 with
 the
 plan
 adopted
 in
 the
 council
 of
 the
 Gods
 man
 was
 created
 as
 an
 embodied
 spirit
 his
 tabernacle
 of
 flesh
 was
 composed
 of
 the
 elements
 of
 earth
 He
 was
 given
 commandment
 and
 law
 and
 was
 free
 to
 obey
 or
 disobeywith
 the
 just
 and
 inevitable
 condition
 that
 he
 should
 enjoy
 or
 suffer
 the
 natural
 results
 of
 his
 choice
 Adam
 the
 first
 man
 placed
 upon
 the
 earth
 in
 pursuance
 of
 the
 established
 plan
 and
 Eve
 who
 was
 given
 unto
 him
 as
 companion
 and
 associate
 indispensable
 to
 him
 in
 the
 appointed
 mission
 of
 peopling
 the
 earth
 disobeyed
 the
 express
 commandment
 of
 God
 and
 so
 brought
 about
 the
 fall
 of
 man
 whereby
 the
 mortal
 state
 of
 which
 death
 is
 an
 essential
 element
 was
 inaugurated
 It
 is
 not
 proposed
 to
 consider
 here
 at
 length
 the
 doctrine
 of
 the
 fall
 for
 the
 present
 argument
 it
 is
 sufficient
 to
 establish
 the
 fact
 of
 the
 momentous
 occurrence
 and
 its
 portentous
 consequences
 The
 woman
 was
 deceived
 and
 in
 direct
 violation
 of
 counsel
 and
 commandment
 partook
 of
 the
 food
 that
 had
 been
 forbidden
 as
 a
 result
 of
 which
 act
 her
 body
 became
 degenerate
 and
 subject
 to
 death
 Adam
 realized
 the
 disparity
 that
 had
 been
 brought
 between
 him
 and
 his
 companion
 and
 with
 some
 measure
 of
 understanding
 followed
 her
 course
 thus
 becoming
 her
 partner
 in
 bodily
 degeneracy
 Note
 in
 this
 matter
 the
 words
 of
 Paul
 the
 apostle
 Adam
 was
 not
 deceived
 but
 the
 woman
 being
 deceived
 was
 in
 the
 transgression
 The
 man
 and
 the
 woman
 had
 now
 become
 mortal
 through
 indulgence
 in
 food
 unsuited
 to
 their
 nature
 and
 condition
 and
 against
 which
 they
 had
 been
 specifically
 warned
 and
 as
 the
 inevitable
 result
 of
 their
 disobeying
 the
 divine
 law
 and
 commandment
 they
 became
 liable
 to
 the
 physical
 ailments
 and
 bodily
 frailties
 to
 which
 mankind
 has
 since
 been
 the
 natural
 heir
 Those
 bodies
 which
 before
 the
 fall
 had
 been
 perfect
 in
 form
 and
 function
 were
 now
 subjects
 for
 eventual
 dissolution
 or
 death
 The
 archtempter
 through
 whose
 sophistries
 halftruths
 and
 infamous
 falsehoods
 Eve
 had
 been
 beguiled
 was
 none
 other
 than
 Satan
 or
 Lucifer
 that
 rebellious
 and
 fallen
 son
 of
 the
 morning
 whose
 proposal
 involving
 the
 destruction
 of
 mans
 liberty
 had
 been
 rejected
 in
 the
 council
 of
 the
 heavens
 and
 who
 had
 been
 cast
 out
 into
 the
 earth
 he
 and
 all
 his
 angels
 as
 unbodied
 spirits
 never
 to
 be
 tabernacled
 in
 bodies
 of
 their
 own
 As
 an
 act
 of
 diabolic
 reprisal
 following
 his
 rejection
 in
 the
 council
 his
 defeat
 by
 Michael
 and
 the
 heavenly
 hosts
 and
 his
 ignominious
 expulsion
 from
 heaven
 Satan
 planned
 to
 destroy
 the
 bodies
 in
 which
 the
 faithful
 spiritsthose
 who
 had
 kept
 their
 first
 estatewould
 be
 born
 and
 his
 beguilement
 of
 Eve
 was
 but
 an
 early
 stage
 of
 that
 infernal
 scheme
 Death
 has
 come
 to
 be
 the
 universal
 heritage
 it
 may
 claim
 its
 victim
 in
 infancy
 or
 youth
 in
 the
 period
 of
 lifes
 prime
 or
 its
 summons
 may
 be
 deferred
 until
 the
 snows
 of
 age
 have
 gathered
 upon
 the
 hoary
 head
 it
 may
 befall
 as
 the
 result
 of
 accident
 or
 disease
 by
 violence
 or
 as
 we
 say
 through
 natural
 causes
 but
 come
 it
 must
 as
 Satan
 well
 knows
 and
 in
 this
 knowledge
 is
 his
 present
 though
 but
 temporary
 triumph
 But
 the
 purposes
 of
 God
 as
 they
 ever
 have
 been
 and
 ever
 shall
 be
 are
 infinitely
 superior
 to
 the
 deepest
 designs
 of
 men
 or
 devils
 and
 the
 Satanic
 machinations
 to
 make
 death
 inevitable
 perpetual
 and
 supreme
 were
 provided
 against
 even
 before
 the
 first
 man
 had
 been
 created
 in
 the
 flesh
 The
 atonement
 to
 be
 wrought
 by
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 was
 ordained
 to
 overcome
 death
 and
 to
 provide
 a
 means
 of
 ransom
 from
 the
 power
 of
 Satan
 As
 the
 penalty
 incident
 to
 the
 fall
 came
 upon
 the
 race
 through
 an
 individual
 act
 it
 would
 be
 manifestly
 unjust
 and
 therefore
 impossible
 as
 part
 of
 the
 divine
 purpose
 to
 make
 all
 men
 suffer
 the
 results
 thereof
 without
 provision
 for
 deliverance
 Moreover
 since
 by
 the
 transgression
 of
 one
 man
 sin
 came
 into
 the
 world
 and
 death
 was
 entailed
 upon
 all
 it
 is
 consistent
 with
 reason
 that
 the
 atonement
 thus
 made
 necessary
 should
 be
 wrought
 by
 one
 Wherefore
 as
 by
 one
 man
 sin
 entered
 into
 the
 world
 and
 death
 by
 sin
 and
 so
 death
 passed
 upon
 all
 men
 for
 that
 all
 have
 sinned
 
 Therefore
 as
 by
 the
 offence
 of
 one
 judgment
 came
 upon
 all
 men
 to
 condemnation
 even
 so
 by
 the
 righteousness
 of
 one
 the
 free
 gift
 came
 upon
 all
 men
 unto
 justification
 of
 life
 So
 taught
 the
 apostle
 Paul
 and
 further
 For
 since
 by
 man
 came
 death
 by
 man
 came
 also
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 dead
 For
 as
 in
 Adam
 all
 die
 even
 so
 in
 Christ
 shall
 all
 be
 made
 alive
 The
 atonement
 was
 plainly
 to
 be
 a
 vicarious
 sacrifice
 voluntary
 and
 loveinspired
 on
 the
 Saviors
 part
 universal
 in
 its
 application
 to
 mankind
 so
 far
 as
 men
 shall
 accept
 the
 means
 of
 deliverance
 thus
 placed
 within
 their
 reach
 For
 such
 a
 mission
 only
 one
 who
 was
 without
 sin
 could
 be
 eligible
 Even
 the
 altar
 victims
 of
 ancient
 Israel
 offered
 as
 a
 provisional
 propitiation
 for
 the
 offenses
 of
 the
 people
 under
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 had
 to
 be
 clean
 and
 devoid
 of
 spot
 or
 blemish
 otherwise
 they
 were
 unacceptable
 and
 the
 attempt
 to
 offer
 them
 was
 sacrilege
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 the
 only
 Being
 suited
 to
 the
 requirements
 of
 the
 great
 sacrifice
 As
 the
 one
 and
 only
 sinless
 Man
 As
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 of
 the
 Father
 and
 therefore
 the
 only
 Being
 born
 to
 earth
 possessing
 in
 their
 fulness
 the
 attributes
 of
 both
 Godhood
 and
 manhood
 As
 the
 One
 who
 had
 been
 chosen
 in
 the
 heavens
 and
 foreordained
 to
 this
 service
 What
 other
 man
 has
 been
 without
 sin
 and
 therefore
 wholly
 exempt
 from
 the
 dominion
 of
 Satan
 and
 to
 whom
 death
 the
 wage
 of
 sin
 is
 not
 naturally
 due
 Had
 Jesus
 Christ
 met
 death
 as
 other
 men
 have
 donethe
 result
 of
 the
 power
 that
 Satan
 has
 gained
 over
 them
 through
 their
 sinsHis
 death
 would
 have
 been
 but
 an
 individual
 experience
 expiatory
 in
 no
 degree
 of
 any
 faults
 or
 offenses
 but
 His
 own
 Christs
 absolute
 sinlessness
 made
 Him
 eligible
 His
 humility
 and
 willingness
 rendered
 Him
 acceptable
 to
 the
 Father
 as
 the
 atoning
 sacrifice
 whereby
 propitiation
 could
 be
 made
 for
 the
 sins
 of
 all
 men
 What
 other
 man
 has
 lived
 with
 power
 to
 withstand
 death
 over
 whom
 death
 could
 not
 prevail
 except
 through
 his
 own
 submission
 Yet
 Jesus
 Christ
 could
 not
 be
 slain
 until
 His
 hour
 had
 come
 and
 that
 the
 hour
 in
 which
 He
 voluntarily
 surrendered
 His
 life
 and
 permitted
 His
 own
 decease
 through
 an
 act
 of
 will
 Born
 of
 a
 mortal
 mother
 He
 inherited
 the
 capacity
 to
 die
 begotten
 by
 an
 immortal
 Sire
 He
 possessed
 as
 a
 heritage
 the
 power
 to
 withstand
 death
 indefinitely
 He
 literally
 gave
 up
 His
 life
 to
 this
 effect
 is
 His
 own
 affirmation
 Therefore
 doth
 my
 Father
 love
 me
 because
 I
 lay
 down
 my
 life
 that
 I
 might
 take
 it
 again
 No
 man
 taketh
 it
 from
 me
 but
 I
 lay
 it
 down
 of
 myself
 I
 have
 power
 to
 lay
 it
 down
 and
 I
 have
 power
 to
 take
 it
 again
 And
 further
 For
 as
 the
 Father
 hath
 life
 in
 himself
 so
 hath
 he
 given
 to
 the
 Son
 to
 have
 life
 in
 himself
 Only
 such
 a
 One
 could
 conquer
 death
 in
 none
 but
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 was
 realized
 this
 requisite
 condition
 of
 a
 Redeemer
 of
 the
 world
 What
 other
 man
 has
 come
 to
 earth
 with
 such
 appointment
 clothed
 with
 the
 authority
 of
 such
 foreordination
 The
 atoning
 mission
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 no
 selfassumption
 True
 He
 had
 offered
 Himself
 when
 the
 call
 was
 made
 in
 the
 heavens
 true
 He
 had
 been
 accepted
 and
 in
 due
 time
 came
 to
 earth
 to
 carry
 into
 effect
 the
 terms
 of
 that
 acceptance
 but
 He
 was
 chosen
 by
 One
 greater
 than
 Himself
 The
 burden
 of
 His
 confession
 of
 authority
 was
 ever
 to
 the
 effect
 that
 He
 operated
 under
 the
 direction
 of
 the
 Father
 as
 witness
 these
 words
 I
 came
 down
 from
 heaven
 not
 to
 do
 mine
 own
 will
 but
 the
 will
 of
 him
 that
 sent
 me
 My
 meat
 is
 to
 do
 the
 will
 of
 him
 that
 sent
 me
 and
 to
 finish
 his
 work
 I
 can
 of
 mine
 own
 self
 do
 nothing
 as
 I
 hear
 I
 judge
 and
 my
 judgment
 is
 just
 because
 I
 seek
 not
 mine
 own
 will
 but
 the
 will
 of
 the
 Father
 which
 hath
 sent
 me
 Through
 the
 atonement
 accomplished
 by
 Jesus
 Christa
 redeeming
 service
 vicariously
 rendered
 in
 behalf
 of
 mankind
 all
 of
 whom
 have
 become
 estranged
 from
 God
 by
 the
 effects
 of
 sin
 both
 inherited
 and
 individually
 incurredthe
 way
 is
 opened
 for
 a
 reconciliation
 whereby
 man
 may
 come
 again
 into
 communion
 with
 God
 and
 be
 made
 fit
 to
 dwell
 anew
 and
 forever
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 his
 Eternal
 Father
 This
 basal
 thought
 is
 admirably
 implied
 in
 our
 English
 word
 atonement
 which
 as
 its
 syllables
 attest
 is
 atonement
 denoting
 reconciliation
 or
 the
 bringing
 into
 agreement
 of
 those
 who
 have
 been
 estranged
 The
 effect
 of
 the
 atonement
 may
 be
 conveniently
 considered
 as
 twofold
 The
 universal
 redemption
 of
 the
 human
 race
 from
 death
 invoked
 by
 the
 fall
 of
 our
 first
 parents
 and
 Salvation
 whereby
 means
 of
 relief
 from
 the
 results
 of
 individual
 sin
 are
 provided
 The
 victory
 over
 death
 was
 made
 manifest
 in
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 crucified
 Christ
 He
 was
 the
 first
 to
 pass
 from
 death
 to
 immortality
 and
 so
 is
 justly
 known
 as
 the
 first
 fruits
 of
 them
 that
 slept
 That
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 dead
 so
 inaugurated
 is
 to
 be
 extended
 to
 every
 one
 who
 has
 or
 shall
 have
 lived
 is
 proved
 by
 an
 abundance
 of
 scriptural
 evidence
 Following
 our
 Lords
 resurrection
 others
 who
 had
 slept
 in
 the
 tomb
 arose
 and
 were
 seen
 of
 many
 not
 as
 spiritapparitions
 but
 as
 resurrected
 beings
 possessing
 immortalized
 bodies
 And
 the
 graves
 were
 opened
 and
 many
 bodies
 of
 the
 saints
 which
 slept
 arose
 and
 came
 out
 of
 the
 graves
 after
 his
 resurrection
 and
 went
 into
 the
 holy
 city
 and
 appeared
 unto
 many
 Those
 who
 thus
 early
 came
 forth
 are
 spoken
 of
 as
 the
 saints
 and
 other
 scriptures
 confirm
 the
 fact
 that
 only
 the
 righteous
 shall
 be
 brought
 forth
 in
 the
 earlier
 stages
 of
 the
 resurrection
 yet
 to
 be
 consummated
 but
 that
 all
 the
 dead
 shall
 in
 turn
 resume
 bodies
 of
 flesh
 and
 bones
 is
 placed
 beyond
 doubt
 by
 the
 revealed
 word
 The
 Saviors
 direct
 affirmation
 ought
 to
 be
 conclusive
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 The
 hour
 is
 coming
 and
 now
 is
 when
 the
 dead
 shall
 hear
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 and
 they
 that
 hear
 shall
 live
 Marvel
 not
 at
 this
 for
 the
 hour
 is
 coming
 in
 the
 which
 all
 that
 are
 in
 the
 graves
 shall
 hear
 his
 voice
 and
 shall
 come
 forth
 they
 that
 have
 done
 good
 unto
 the
 resurrection
 of
 life
 and
 they
 that
 have
 done
 evil
 unto
 the
 resurrection
 of
 damnation
 The
 doctrine
 of
 a
 universal
 resurrection
 was
 taught
 by
 the
 apostles
 of
 old
 as
 also
 by
 the
 Nephite
 prophets
 and
 the
 same
 is
 confirmed
 by
 revelation
 incident
 to
 the
 present
 dispensation
 Even
 the
 heathen
 who
 have
 not
 known
 God
 shall
 be
 brought
 forth
 from
 their
 graves
 and
 inasmuch
 as
 they
 have
 lived
 and
 died
 in
 ignorance
 of
 the
 saving
 law
 a
 means
 of
 making
 the
 plan
 of
 salvation
 known
 unto
 them
 is
 provided
 And
 then
 shall
 the
 heathen
 nations
 be
 redeemed
 and
 they
 that
 knew
 no
 law
 shall
 have
 part
 in
 the
 first
 resurrection
 Jacob
 a
 Nephite
 prophet
 taught
 the
 universality
 of
 the
 resurrection
 and
 set
 forth
 the
 absolute
 need
 of
 a
 Redeemer
 without
 whom
 the
 purposes
 of
 God
 in
 the
 creation
 of
 man
 would
 be
 rendered
 futile
 His
 words
 constitute
 a
 concise
 and
 forceful
 summary
 of
 revealed
 truth
 directly
 bearing
 upon
 our
 present
 subject
 For
 as
 death
 hath
 passed
 upon
 all
 men
 to
 fulfil
 the
 merciful
 plan
 of
 the
 great
 Creator
 there
 must
 needs
 be
 a
 power
 of
 resurrection
 and
 the
 resurrection
 must
 needs
 come
 unto
 man
 by
 reason
 of
 the
 fall
 and
 the
 fall
 came
 by
 reason
 of
 transgression
 and
 because
 man
 became
 fallen
 they
 were
 cut
 off
 from
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 Lord
 wherefore
 it
 must
 needs
 be
 an
 infinite
 atonement
 save
 it
 should
 be
 an
 infinite
 atonement
 this
 corruption
 could
 not
 put
 on
 incorruption
 Wherefore
 the
 first
 judgment
 which
 came
 upon
 man
 must
 needs
 have
 remained
 to
 an
 endless
 duration
 And
 if
 so
 this
 flesh
 must
 have
 laid
 down
 to
 rot
 and
 to
 crumble
 to
 its
 mother
 earth
 to
 rise
 no
 more
 O
 the
 wisdom
 of
 God
 his
 mercy
 and
 grace
 For
 behold
 if
 the
 flesh
 should
 rise
 no
 more
 our
 spirits
 must
 become
 subject
 to
 that
 angel
 who
 fell
 from
 before
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 eternal
 God
 and
 became
 the
 devil
 to
 rise
 no
 more
 And
 our
 spirits
 must
 have
 become
 like
 unto
 him
 and
 we
 become
 devils
 angels
 to
 a
 devil
 to
 be
 shut
 out
 from
 the
 presence
 of
 our
 God
 and
 to
 remain
 with
 the
 father
 of
 lies
 in
 misery
 like
 unto
 himself
 yea
 to
 that
 being
 who
 beguiled
 our
 first
 parents
 who
 transformeth
 himself
 nigh
 unto
 an
 angel
 of
 light
 and
 stirreth
 up
 the
 children
 of
 men
 unto
 secret
 combinations
 of
 murder
 and
 all
 manner
 of
 secret
 works
 of
 darkness
 O
 how
 great
 the
 goodness
 of
 our
 God
 who
 prepareth
 a
 way
 for
 our
 escape
 from
 the
 grasp
 of
 this
 awful
 monster
 yea
 that
 monster
 death
 and
 hell
 which
 I
 call
 the
 death
 of
 the
 body
 and
 also
 the
 death
 of
 the
 spirit
 And
 because
 of
 the
 way
 of
 deliverance
 of
 our
 God
 the
 Holy
 One
 of
 Israel
 this
 death
 of
 which
 I
 have
 spoken
 which
 is
 the
 temporal
 shall
 deliver
 up
 its
 dead
 which
 death
 is
 the
 grave
 And
 this
 death
 of
 which
 I
 have
 spoken
 which
 is
 the
 spiritual
 death
 shall
 deliver
 up
 its
 dead
 which
 spiritual
 death
 is
 hell
 wherefore
 death
 and
 hell
 must
 deliver
 up
 their
 dead
 and
 hell
 must
 deliver
 up
 its
 captive
 spirits
 and
 the
 grave
 must
 deliver
 up
 its
 captive
 bodies
 and
 the
 bodies
 and
 the
 spirits
 of
 men
 will
 be
 restored
 one
 to
 the
 other
 and
 it
 is
 by
 the
 power
 of
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 Holy
 One
 of
 Israel
 O
 how
 great
 the
 plan
 of
 our
 God
 For
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 the
 paradise
 of
 God
 must
 deliver
 up
 the
 spirits
 of
 the
 righteous
 and
 the
 grave
 deliver
 up
 the
 body
 of
 the
 righteous
 and
 the
 spirit
 and
 the
 body
 is
 restored
 to
 itself
 again
 and
 all
 men
 become
 incorruptible
 and
 immortal
 and
 they
 are
 living
 souls
 having
 a
 perfect
 knowledge
 like
 unto
 us
 in
 the
 flesh
 save
 it
 be
 that
 our
 knowledge
 shall
 be
 perfect
 The
 application
 of
 the
 atonement
 to
 individual
 transgression
 whereby
 the
 sinner
 may
 obtain
 absolution
 through
 compliance
 with
 the
 laws
 and
 ordinances
 embodied
 in
 the
 gospel
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 is
 conclusively
 attested
 by
 scripture
 Since
 forgiveness
 of
 sins
 can
 be
 secured
 in
 none
 other
 way
 there
 being
 either
 in
 heaven
 or
 earth
 no
 name
 save
 that
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 whereby
 salvation
 shall
 come
 unto
 the
 children
 of
 men
 every
 soul
 stands
 in
 need
 of
 the
 Saviors
 mediation
 since
 all
 are
 sinners
 For
 all
 have
 sinned
 and
 come
 short
 of
 the
 glory
 of
 God
 said
 Paul
 of
 old
 and
 John
 the
 apostle
 added
 his
 testimony
 in
 these
 words
 If
 we
 say
 that
 we
 have
 no
 sin
 we
 deceive
 ourselves
 and
 the
 truth
 is
 not
 in
 us
 Who
 shall
 question
 the
 justice
 of
 God
 which
 denies
 salvation
 to
 all
 who
 will
 not
 comply
 with
 the
 prescribed
 conditions
 on
 which
 alone
 it
 is
 declared
 obtainable
 Christ
 is
 the
 author
 of
 eternal
 salvation
 unto
 all
 them
 that
 obey
 him
 and
 God
 will
 render
 to
 every
 man
 according
 to
 his
 deeds
 to
 them
 who
 by
 patient
 continuance
 in
 well
 doing
 seek
 for
 glory
 and
 honor
 and
 immortality
 eternal
 life
 but
 unto
 them
 that
 are
 contentious
 and
 do
 not
 obey
 the
 truth
 but
 obey
 unrighteousness
 indignation
 and
 wrath
 tribulation
 and
 anguish
 upon
 every
 soul
 of
 man
 that
 doeth
 evil
 Such
 then
 is
 the
 need
 of
 a
 Redeemer
 for
 without
 Him
 mankind
 would
 forever
 remain
 in
 a
 fallen
 state
 and
 as
 to
 hope
 of
 eternal
 progression
 would
 be
 inevitably
 lost
 The
 mortal
 probation
 is
 provided
 as
 an
 opportunity
 for
 advancement
 but
 so
 great
 are
 the
 difficulties
 and
 the
 dangers
 so
 strong
 is
 the
 influence
 of
 evil
 in
 the
 world
 and
 so
 weak
 is
 man
 in
 resistance
 thereto
 that
 without
 the
 aid
 of
 a
 power
 above
 that
 of
 humanity
 no
 soul
 would
 find
 its
 way
 back
 to
 God
 from
 whom
 it
 came
 The
 need
 of
 a
 Redeemer
 lies
 in
 the
 inability
 of
 man
 to
 raise
 himself
 from
 the
 temporal
 to
 the
 spiritual
 plane
 from
 the
 lower
 kingdom
 to
 the
 higher
 In
 this
 conception
 we
 are
 not
 without
 analogies
 in
 the
 natural
 world
 We
 recognize
 a
 fundamental
 distinction
 between
 inanimate
 and
 living
 matter
 between
 the
 inorganic
 and
 the
 organic
 between
 the
 lifeless
 mineral
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 and
 the
 living
 plant
 or
 animal
 on
 the
 other
 Within
 the
 limitations
 of
 its
 order
 the
 dead
 mineral
 grows
 by
 accretion
 of
 substance
 and
 may
 attain
 a
 relatively
 perfect
 condition
 of
 structure
 and
 form
 as
 is
 seen
 in
 the
 crystal
 But
 mineral
 matter
 though
 acted
 upon
 favorably
 by
 the
 forces
 of
 naturelight
 heat
 electric
 energy
 and
 otherscan
 never
 become
 a
 living
 organism
 nor
 can
 the
 dead
 elements
 through
 any
 process
 of
 chemical
 combination
 dissociated
 from
 life
 enter
 into
 the
 tissues
 of
 the
 plant
 as
 essential
 parts
 thereof
 But
 the
 plant
 which
 is
 of
 a
 higher
 order
 sends
 its
 rootlets
 into
 the
 earth
 spreads
 its
 leaves
 in
 the
 atmosphere
 and
 through
 these
 organs
 absorbs
 the
 solutions
 of
 the
 soil
 inspires
 the
 gases
 of
 the
 air
 and
 from
 such
 lifeless
 materials
 weaves
 the
 tissue
 of
 its
 wondrous
 structure
 No
 mineral
 particle
 no
 dead
 chemical
 substance
 has
 ever
 been
 made
 a
 constituent
 of
 organic
 tissue
 except
 through
 the
 agency
 of
 life
 We
 may
 perhaps
 with
 profit
 carry
 the
 analogy
 a
 step
 farther
 The
 plant
 is
 unable
 to
 advance
 its
 own
 tissue
 to
 the
 animal
 plane
 Though
 it
 be
 the
 recognized
 order
 of
 nature
 that
 the
 animal
 kingdom
 is
 dependent
 upon
 the
 vegetable
 kingdom
 for
 its
 sustenance
 the
 substance
 of
 the
 plant
 may
 become
 part
 of
 the
 animal
 organism
 only
 as
 the
 latter
 reaches
 down
 from
 its
 higher
 plane
 and
 by
 its
 own
 vital
 action
 incorporates
 the
 vegetable
 compounds
 with
 itself
 In
 turn
 animal
 matter
 can
 never
 become
 even
 transitorily
 part
 of
 a
 human
 body
 except
 as
 the
 living
 man
 assimilates
 it
 and
 by
 the
 vital
 processes
 of
 his
 own
 existence
 lifts
 for
 the
 time
 being
 the
 substance
 of
 the
 animal
 that
 supplied
 him
 food
 to
 the
 higher
 plane
 of
 his
 own
 existence
 The
 comparison
 herein
 employed
 is
 admittedly
 defective
 if
 carried
 beyond
 reasonable
 limits
 of
 application
 for
 the
 raising
 of
 mineral
 matter
 to
 the
 plane
 of
 the
 plant
 vegetable
 tissue
 to
 the
 level
 of
 the
 animal
 and
 the
 elevation
 of
 either
 to
 the
 human
 plane
 is
 but
 a
 temporary
 change
 with
 the
 dissolution
 of
 the
 higher
 tissues
 the
 material
 thereof
 falls
 again
 to
 the
 level
 of
 the
 inanimate
 and
 the
 dead
 But
 as
 a
 means
 of
 illustration
 the
 analogy
 may
 not
 be
 wholly
 without
 value
 So
 for
 the
 advancement
 of
 man
 from
 his
 present
 fallen
 and
 relatively
 degenerate
 state
 to
 the
 higher
 condition
 of
 spiritual
 life
 a
 power
 above
 his
 own
 must
 cooperate
 Through
 the
 operation
 of
 the
 laws
 obtaining
 in
 the
 higher
 kingdom
 man
 may
 be
 reached
 and
 lifted
 himself
 he
 cannot
 save
 by
 his
 own
 unaided
 effort
 A
 Redeemer
 and
 Savior
 of
 mankind
 is
 beyond
 all
 question
 essential
 to
 the
 realization
 of
 the
 plan
 of
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 to
 bring
 to
 pass
 the
 immortality
 and
 eternal
 life
 of
 man
 and
 that
 Redeemer
 and
 Savior
 is
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 beside
 whom
 there
 is
 and
 can
 be
 none

 Gods
 Foreknowledge
 Not
 a
 Determining
 CauseRespecting
 the
 foreknowledge
 of
 God
 let
 it
 not
 be
 said
 that
 divine
 omniscience
 is
 of
 itself
 a
 determining
 cause
 whereby
 events
 are
 inevitably
 brought
 to
 pass
 A
 mortal
 father
 who
 knows
 the
 weaknesses
 and
 frailties
 of
 his
 son
 may
 by
 reason
 of
 that
 knowledge
 sorrowfully
 predict
 the
 calamities
 and
 sufferings
 awaiting
 his
 wayward
 boy
 He
 may
 foresee
 in
 that
 sons
 future
 a
 forfeiture
 of
 blessings
 that
 could
 have
 been
 won
 loss
 of
 position
 selfrespect
 reputation
 and
 honor
 even
 the
 dark
 shadows
 of
 a
 felons
 cell
 and
 the
 night
 of
 a
 drunkards
 grave
 may
 appear
 in
 the
 saddening
 visions
 of
 that
 fond
 fathers
 soul
 yet
 convinced
 by
 experience
 of
 the
 impossibility
 of
 bringing
 about
 that
 sons
 reform
 he
 foresees
 the
 dread
 developments
 of
 the
 future
 and
 he
 finds
 but
 sorrow
 and
 anguish
 in
 his
 knowledge
 Can
 it
 be
 said
 that
 the
 fathers
 foreknowledge
 is
 a
 cause
 of
 the
 sons
 sinful
 life
 The
 son
 perchance
 has
 reached
 his
 maturity
 he
 is
 the
 master
 of
 his
 own
 destiny
 a
 free
 agent
 unto
 himself
 The
 father
 is
 powerless
 to
 control
 by
 force
 or
 to
 direct
 by
 arbitrary
 command
 and
 while
 he
 would
 gladly
 make
 any
 effort
 or
 sacrifice
 to
 save
 his
 son
 from
 the
 fate
 impending
 he
 fears
 for
 what
 seems
 to
 be
 an
 awful
 certainty
 But
 surely
 that
 thoughtful
 prayerful
 loving
 parent
 does
 not
 because
 of
 his
 knowledge
 contribute
 to
 the
 sons
 waywardness
 To
 reason
 otherwise
 would
 be
 to
 say
 that
 a
 neglectful
 father
 who
 takes
 not
 the
 trouble
 to
 study
 the
 nature
 and
 character
 of
 his
 son
 who
 shuts
 his
 eyes
 to
 sinful
 tendencies
 and
 rests
 in
 careless
 indifference
 as
 to
 the
 probable
 future
 will
 by
 his
 very
 heartlessness
 be
 benefitting
 his
 child
 because
 his
 lack
 of
 forethought
 cannot
 operate
 as
 a
 contributory
 cause
 to
 dereliction
 Our
 Heavenly
 Father
 has
 a
 full
 knowledge
 of
 the
 nature
 and
 disposition
 of
 each
 of
 His
 children
 a
 knowledge
 gained
 by
 long
 observation
 and
 experience
 in
 the
 past
 eternity
 of
 our
 primeval
 childhood
 a
 knowledge
 compared
 with
 which
 that
 gained
 by
 earthly
 parents
 through
 mortal
 experience
 with
 their
 children
 is
 infinitesimally
 small
 By
 reason
 of
 that
 surpassing
 knowledge
 God
 reads
 the
 future
 of
 child
 and
 children
 of
 men
 individually
 and
 of
 men
 collectively
 as
 communities
 and
 nations
 He
 knows
 what
 each
 will
 do
 under
 given
 conditions
 and
 sees
 the
 end
 from
 the
 beginning
 His
 foreknowledge
 is
 based
 on
 intelligence
 and
 reason
 He
 foresees
 the
 future
 as
 a

 Man
 Free

 Father
 of

 has
 endowed
 His

 does
 not

 He

 This
 the
 Word
 of
 Wisdom
 like
 other
 revelations
 that
 have
 come
 in
 the
 present
 dispensation
 is
 not
 wholly
 new
 It
 is
 as
 old
 as
 the
 human
 race
 The
 principle
 of
 the
 Word
 of
 Wisdom
 was
 revealed
 unto
 Adam
 All
 the
 essentials
 of
 the
 Word
 of
 Wisdom
 were
 made
 known
 unto
 him
 in
 his
 immortal
 state
 before
 he
 had
 taken
 into
 his
 body
 those
 things
 that
 made
 of
 it
 a
 thing
 of
 earth
 He
 was
 warned
 against
 that
 very
 practise
 He
 was
 not
 told
 to
 treat
 his
 body
 as
 something
 to
 be
 tortured
 He
 was
 not
 told
 to
 look
 upon
 it
 as
 the
 fakir
 of
 India
 has
 come
 to
 look
 upon
 his
 body
 or
 professes
 to
 look
 upon
 it
 as
 a
 thing
 to
 be
 utterly
 contemned
 but
 he
 was
 told
 that
 he
 must
 not
 take
 into
 that
 body
 certain
 things
 which
 were
 there
 at
 hand
 He
 was
 warned
 that
 if
 he
 did
 his
 body
 would
 lose
 the
 power
 which
 it
 then
 held
 of
 living
 for
 ever
 and
 that
 he
 would
 become
 subject
 to
 death
 It
 was
 pointed
 out
 to
 him
 as
 it
 has
 been
 pointed
 out
 to
 you
 that
 there
 are
 many
 good
 fruits
 to
 be
 plucked
 to
 be
 eaten
 to
 be
 enjoyed
 We
 believe
 in
 enjoying
 good
 food
 We
 think
 that
 these
 good
 things
 are
 given
 us
 of
 God
 We
 believe
 in
 getting
 all
 the
 enjoyment
 out
 of
 eating
 that
 we
 can
 and
 therefore
 we
 should
 avoid
 gluttony
 and
 we
 should
 avoid
 extremes
 in
 all
 our
 habits
 of
 eating
 and
 as
 was
 told
 unto
 Adam
 so
 is
 it
 told
 unto
 us
 Touch
 not
 these
 things
 for
 in
 the
 day
 that
 thou
 doest
 it
 thy
 life
 shall
 be
 shortened
 and
 thou
 shalt
 die
 Here
 let
 me
 say
 that
 therein
 consisted
 the
 fallthe
 eating
 of
 things
 unfit
 the
 taking
 into
 the
 body
 of
 the
 things
 that
 made
 of
 that
 body
 a
 thing
 of
 earth
 and
 I
 take
 this
 occasion
 to
 raise
 my
 voice
 against
 the
 false
 interpretation
 of
 scripture
 which
 has
 been
 adopted
 by
 certain
 people
 and
 is
 current
 in
 their
 minds
 and
 is
 referred
 to
 in
 a
 hushed
 and
 halfsecret
 way
 that
 the
 fall
 of
 man
 consisted
 in
 some
 offense
 against
 the
 laws
 of
 chastity
 and
 of
 virtue
 Such
 a
 doctrine
 is
 an
 abomination
 What
 right
 have
 we
 to
 turn
 the
 scriptures
 from
 their
 proper
 sense
 and
 meaning
 What
 right
 have
 we
 to
 declare
 that
 God
 meant
 not
 what
 He
 said
 The
 fall
 was
 a
 natural
 process
 resulting
 through
 the
 incorporation
 into
 the
 bodies
 of
 our
 first
 parents
 of
 the
 things
 that
 came
 from
 food
 unfit
 through
 the
 violation
 of
 the
 command
 of
 God
 regarding
 what
 they
 should
 eat
 Dont
 go
 around
 whispering
 that
 the
 fall
 consisted
 in
 the
 mother
 of
 the
 race
 losing
 her
 chastity
 and
 her
 virtue
 It
 is
 not
 true
 the
 human
 race
 is
 not
 born
 of
 fornication
 These
 bodies
 that
 are
 given
 unto
 us
 are
 given
 in
 the
 way
 that
 God
 has
 provided
 Let
 it
 not
 be
 said
 that
 the
 patriarch
 of
 the
 race
 who
 stood
 with
 the
 gods
 before
 he
 came
 here
 upon
 the
 earth
 and
 his
 equally
 royal
 consort
 were
 guilty
 of
 any
 such
 foul
 offense
 The
 adoption
 of
 that
 belief
 has
 led
 many
 to
 excuse
 departures
 from
 the
 path
 of
 chastity
 and
 the
 path
 of
 virtue
 by
 saying
 that
 it
 is
 the
 sin
 of
 the
 race
 that
 it
 is
 as
 old
 as
 Adam
 It
 was
 not
 introduced
 by
 Adam
 It
 was
 not
 committed
 by
 Eve
 It
 was
 the
 introduction
 of
 the
 devil
 and
 came
 in
 order
 that
 he
 might
 sow
 the
 seeds
 of
 early
 death
 in
 the
 bodies
 of
 men
 and
 women
 that
 the
 race
 should
 degenerate
 as
 it
 has
 degenerated
 whenever
 the
 laws
 of
 virtue
 and
 of
 chastity
 have
 been
 transgressed
 Our
 first
 parents
 were
 pure
 and
 noble
 and
 when
 we
 pass
 behind
 the
 veil
 we
 shall
 perhaps
 learn
 something
 of
 their
 high
 estate
 more
 than
 we
 know
 now
 But
 be
 it
 known
 that
 they
 were
 pure
 they
 were
 noble
 It
 is
 true
 that
 they
 disobeyed
 the
 law
 of
 God
 in
 eating
 things
 they
 were
 told
 not
 to
 eat
 but
 who
 amongst
 you
 can
 rise
 up
 and
 condemnFrom

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 ANTEMORTAL
 GODSHIP
 OF
 CHRIST
 It
 now
 becomes
 our
 purpose
 to
 inquire
 as
 to
 the
 position
 and
 status
 of
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 in
 the
 antemortal
 world
 from
 the
 period
 of
 the
 solemn
 council
 in
 heaven
 in
 which
 He
 was
 chosen
 to
 be
 the
 future
 Savior
 and
 Redeemer
 of
 mankind
 to
 the
 time
 at
 which
 He
 was
 born
 in
 the
 flesh
 We
 claim
 scriptural
 authority
 for
 the
 assertion
 that
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 and
 is
 God
 the
 Creator
 the
 God
 who
 revealed
 Himself
 to
 Adam
 Enoch
 and
 all
 the
 antediluvial
 patriarchs
 and
 prophets
 down
 to
 Noah
 the
 God
 of
 Abraham
 Isaac
 and
 Jacob
 the
 God
 of
 Israel
 as
 a
 united
 people
 and
 the
 God
 of
 Ephraim
 and
 Judah
 after
 the
 disruption
 of
 the
 Hebrew
 nation
 the
 God
 who
 made
 Himself
 known
 to
 the
 prophets
 from
 Moses
 to
 Malachi
 the
 God
 of
 the
 Old
 Testament
 record
 and
 the
 God
 of
 the
 Nephites
 We
 affirm
 that
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 and
 is
 Jehovah
 the
 Eternal
 One
 The
 scriptures
 specify
 three
 personages
 in
 the
 Godhead
 
 God
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 
 His
 Son
 Jesus
 Christ
 and
 
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 These
 constitute
 the
 Holy
 Trinity
 comprizing
 three
 physically
 separate
 and
 distinct
 individuals
 who
 together
 constitute
 the
 presiding
 council
 of
 the
 heavens
 At
 least
 two
 of
 these
 appear
 as
 directing
 participants
 in
 the
 work
 of
 creation
 this
 fact
 is
 instanced
 by
 the
 plurality
 expressed
 in
 Genesis
 And
 God
 said
 Let
 us
 make
 man
 in
 our
 image
 after
 our
 likeness
 and
 later
 in
 the
 course
 of
 consultation
 concerning
 Adams
 act
 of
 transgression
 the
 Lord
 God
 said
 Behold
 the
 man
 is
 become
 as
 one
 of
 us
 From
 the
 words
 of
 Moses
 as
 revealed
 anew
 in
 the
 present
 dispensation
 we
 learn
 more
 fully
 of
 the
 Gods
 who
 were
 actively
 engaged
 in
 the
 creation
 of
 this
 earth
 And
 I
 God
 said
 unto
 mine
 Only
 Begotten
 which
 was
 with
 me
 from
 the
 beginning
 Let
 us
 make
 man
 in
 our
 image
 after
 our
 likeness
 Then
 further
 with
 regard
 to
 the
 condition
 of
 Adam
 after
 the
 fall
 I
 the
 Lord
 God
 said
 unto
 mine
 Only
 Begotten
 Behold
 the
 man
 is
 become
 as
 one
 of
 us
 In
 the
 account
 of
 the
 creation
 recorded
 by
 Abraham
 the
 Gods
 are
 repeatedly
 mentioned
 As
 heretofore
 shown
 in
 another
 connection
 the
 Father
 operated
 in
 the
 work
 of
 creation
 through
 the
 Son
 who
 thus
 became
 the
 executive
 through
 whom
 the
 will
 commandment
 or
 word
 of
 the
 Father
 was
 put
 into
 effect
 It
 is
 with
 incisive
 appropriateness
 therefore
 that
 the
 Son
 Jesus
 Christ
 is
 designated
 by
 the
 apostle
 John
 as
 the
 Word
 or
 as
 declared
 by
 the
 Father
 the
 word
 of
 my
 power
 The
 part
 taken
 by
 Jesus
 Christ
 in
 the
 creation
 a
 part
 so
 prominent
 as
 to
 justify
 our
 calling
 Him
 the
 Creator
 is
 set
 forth
 in
 many
 scriptures
 The
 author
 of
 the
 Epistle
 to
 the
 Hebrews
 refers
 in
 this
 wise
 distinctively
 to
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Son
 as
 separate
 though
 associated
 Beings
 God
 who
 at
 sundry
 times
 and
 in
 divers
 manners
 spake
 in
 time
 past
 unto
 the
 fathers
 by
 the
 prophets
 hath
 in
 these
 last
 days
 spoken
 unto
 us
 by
 his
 Son
 whom
 he
 hath
 appointed
 heir
 of
 all
 things
 by
 whom
 also
 he
 made
 the
 worlds
 Paul
 is
 even
 more
 explicit
 in
 his
 letter
 to
 the
 Colossians
 wherein
 speaking
 of
 Jesus
 the
 Son
 he
 says
 For
 by
 him
 were
 all
 things
 created
 that
 are
 in
 heaven
 and
 that
 are
 in
 earth
 visible
 and
 invisible
 whether
 they
 be
 thrones
 or
 dominions
 or
 principalities
 or
 powers
 all
 things
 were
 created
 by
 him
 and
 for
 him
 and
 he
 is
 before
 all
 things
 and
 by
 him
 all
 things
 consist
 And
 here
 let
 be
 repeated
 the
 testimony
 of
 John
 that
 by
 the
 Word
 who
 was
 with
 God
 and
 who
 was
 God
 even
 in
 the
 beginning
 all
 things
 were
 made
 and
 without
 him
 was
 not
 anything
 made
 that
 was
 made
 That
 the
 Christ
 who
 was
 to
 come
 was
 in
 reality
 God
 the
 Creator
 was
 revealed
 in
 plainness
 to
 the
 prophets
 on
 the
 western
 hemisphere
 Samuel
 the
 converted
 Lamanite
 in
 preaching
 to
 the
 unbelieving
 Nephites
 justified
 his
 testimony
 as
 follows
 And
 also
 that
 ye
 might
 know
 of
 the
 coming
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 the
 Father
 of
 heaven
 and
 of
 earth
 the
 Creator
 of
 all
 things
 from
 the
 beginning
 and
 that
 ye
 might
 know
 of
 the
 signs
 of
 his
 coming
 to
 the
 intent
 that
 ye
 might
 believe
 on
 his
 name
 To
 these
 citations
 of
 ancient
 scripture
 may
 most
 properly
 be
 added
 the
 personal
 testimony
 of
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 after
 He
 had
 become
 a
 resurrected
 Being
 In
 His
 visitation
 to
 the
 Nephites
 He
 thus
 proclaimed
 Himself
 Behold
 I
 am
 Jesus
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 I
 created
 the
 heavens
 and
 the
 earth
 and
 all
 things
 that
 in
 them
 are
 I
 was
 with
 the
 Father
 from
 the
 beginning
 I
 am
 in
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Father
 in
 me
 and
 in
 me
 hath
 the
 Father
 glorified
 his
 name
 To
 the
 Nephites
 who
 failed
 to
 comprehend
 the
 relation
 between
 the
 gospel
 declared
 unto
 them
 by
 the
 Resurrected
 Lord
 and
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 which
 they
 held
 traditionally
 to
 be
 in
 force
 and
 who
 marveled
 at
 His
 saying
 that
 old
 things
 had
 passed
 away
 He
 explained
 in
 this
 wise
 Behold
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 that
 the
 law
 is
 fulfilled
 that
 was
 given
 unto
 Moses
 Behold
 I
 am
 he
 that
 gave
 the
 law
 and
 I
 am
 he
 who
 covenanted
 with
 my
 people
 Israel
 therefore
 the
 law
 in
 me
 is
 fulfilled
 for
 I
 have
 come
 to
 fulfil
 the
 law
 therefore
 it
 hath
 an
 end
 Through
 revelation
 in
 the
 present
 or
 last
 dispensation
 the
 voice
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 the
 Creator
 of
 heaven
 and
 earth
 has
 been
 heard
 anew
 Hearken
 O
 ye
 people
 of
 my
 church
 to
 whom
 the
 kingdom
 has
 been
 givenhearken
 ye
 and
 give
 ear
 to
 him
 who
 laid
 the
 foundation
 of
 the
 earth
 who
 made
 the
 heavens
 and
 all
 the
 hosts
 thereof
 and
 by
 whom
 all
 things
 were
 made
 which
 live
 and
 move
 and
 have
 a
 being
 And
 again
 Behold
 I
 am
 Jesus
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 the
 living
 God
 who
 created
 the
 heavens
 and
 the
 earth
 a
 light
 which
 cannot
 be
 hid
 in
 darkness
 The
 divinity
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 is
 indicated
 by
 the
 specific
 names
 and
 titles
 authoritatively
 applied
 to
 Him
 According
 to
 mans
 judgment
 there
 may
 be
 but
 little
 importance
 attached
 to
 names
 but
 in
 the
 nomenclature
 of
 the
 Gods
 every
 name
 is
 a
 title
 of
 power
 or
 station
 God
 is
 righteously
 zealous
 of
 the
 sanctity
 of
 His
 own
 name
 and
 of
 names
 given
 by
 His
 appointment
 In
 the
 case
 of
 children
 of
 promise
 names
 have
 been
 prescribed
 before
 birth
 this
 is
 true
 of
 our
 Lord
 Jesus
 and
 of
 the
 Baptist
 John
 who
 was
 sent
 to
 prepare
 the
 way
 for
 the
 Christ
 Names
 of
 persons
 have
 been
 changed
 by
 divine
 direction
 when
 not
 sufficiently
 definite
 as
 titles
 denoting
 the
 particular
 service
 to
 which
 the
 bearers
 were
 called
 or
 the
 special
 blessings
 conferred
 upon
 them
 Jesus
 is
 the
 individual
 name
 of
 the
 Savior
 and
 as
 thus
 spelled
 is
 of
 Greek
 derivation
 its
 Hebrew
 equivalent
 was
 Yehoshua
 or
 Yeshua
 or
 as
 we
 render
 it
 in
 English
 Joshua
 In
 the
 original
 the
 name
 was
 well
 understood
 as
 meaning
 Help
 of
 Jehovah
 or
 Savior
 Though
 as
 common
 an
 appellation
 as
 John
 or
 Henry
 or
 Charles
 today
 the
 name
 was
 nevertheless
 divinely
 prescribed
 as
 already
 stated
 Thus
 unto
 Joseph
 the
 espoused
 husband
 of
 the
 Virgin
 the
 angel
 said
 And
 thou
 shalt
 call
 his
 name
 JESUS
 for
 he
 shall
 save
 his
 people
 from
 their
 sins
 Christ
 is
 a
 sacred
 title
 and
 not
 an
 ordinary
 appellation
 or
 common
 name
 it
 is
 of
 Greek
 derivation
 and
 in
 meaning
 is
 identical
 with
 its
 Hebrew
 equivalent
 Messiah
 or
 Messias
 signifying
 the
 Anointed
 One
 Other
 titles
 each
 possessing
 a
 definitive
 meaning
 such
 as
 Emmanuel
 Savior
 Redeemer
 Only
 Begotten
 Son
 Lord
 Son
 of
 God
 Son
 of
 Man
 and
 many
 more
 are
 of
 scriptural
 occurrence
 the
 fact
 of
 main
 present
 importance
 to
 us
 is
 that
 these
 several
 titles
 are
 expressive
 of
 our
 Lords
 divine
 origin
 and
 Godship
 As
 seen
 the
 essential
 names
 or
 titles
 of
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 were
 made
 known
 before
 His
 birth
 and
 were
 revealed
 to
 prophets
 who
 preceded
 Him
 in
 the
 mortal
 state
 Jehovah
 is
 the
 Anglicized
 rendering
 of
 the
 Hebrew
 Yahveh
 or
 Jahveh
 signifying
 the
 Selfexistent
 One
 or
 The
 Eternal
 This
 name
 is
 generally
 rendered
 in
 our
 English
 version
 of
 the
 Old
 Testament
 as
 LORD
 printed
 in
 capitals
 The
 Hebrew
 Ehyeh
 signifying
 I
 Am
 is
 related
 in
 meaning
 and
 through
 derivation
 with
 the
 term
 Yahveh
 or
 Jehovah
 and
 herein
 lies
 the
 significance
 of
 this
 name
 by
 which
 the
 Lord
 revealed
 Himself
 to
 Moses
 when
 the
 latter
 received
 the
 commission
 to
 go
 into
 Egypt
 and
 deliver
 the
 children
 of
 Israel
 from
 bondage
 Moses
 said
 unto
 God
 Behold
 when
 I
 come
 unto
 the
 children
 of
 Israel
 and
 shall
 say
 unto
 them
 The
 God
 of
 your
 fathers
 hath
 sent
 me
 unto
 you
 and
 they
 shall
 say
 to
 me
 What
 is
 his
 name
 what
 shall
 I
 say
 unto
 them
 And
 God
 said
 unto
 Moses
 I
 AM
 THAT
 I
 AM
 and
 he
 said
 Thus
 shalt
 thou
 say
 unto
 the
 children
 of
 Israel
 I
 AM
 hath
 sent
 me
 unto
 you
 In
 the
 succeeding
 verse
 the
 Lord
 declares
 Himself
 to
 be
 the
 God
 of
 Abraham
 the
 God
 of
 Isaac
 and
 the
 God
 of
 Jacob
 While
 Moses
 was
 in
 Egypt
 the
 Lord
 further
 revealed
 Himself
 saying
 I
 am
 the
 LORD
 and
 I
 appeared
 unto
 Abraham
 unto
 Isaac
 and
 unto
 Jacob
 by
 the
 name
 of
 God
 Almighty
 but
 by
 my
 name
 JEHOVAH
 was
 I
 not
 known
 to
 them
 The
 central
 fact
 connoted
 by
 this
 name
 I
 Am
 or
 Jehovah
 the
 two
 having
 essentially
 the
 same
 meaning
 is
 that
 of
 existence
 or
 duration
 that
 shall
 have
 no
 end
 and
 which
 judged
 by
 all
 human
 standards
 of
 reckoning
 could
 have
 had
 no
 beginning
 the
 name
 is
 related
 to
 such
 other
 titles
 as
 Alpha
 and
 Omega
 the
 first
 and
 the
 last
 the
 beginning
 and
 the
 end
 Jesus
 when
 once
 assailed
 with
 question
 and
 criticism
 from
 certain
 Jews
 who
 regarded
 their
 Abrahamic
 lineage
 as
 an
 assurance
 of
 divine
 preferment
 met
 their
 abusive
 words
 with
 the
 declaration
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Before
 Abraham
 was
 I
 am
 The
 true
 significance
 of
 this
 saying
 would
 be
 more
 plainly
 expressed
 were
 the
 sentence
 punctuated
 and
 pointed
 as
 follows
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Before
 Abraham
 was
 I
 AM
 which
 means
 the
 same
 as
 had
 He
 saidBefore
 Abraham
 was
 I
 Jehovah
 The
 captious
 Jews
 were
 so
 offended
 at
 hearing
 Him
 use
 a
 name
 which
 through
 an
 erroneous
 rendering
 of
 an
 earlier
 scripture
 they
 held
 was
 not
 to
 be
 uttered
 on
 pain
 of
 death
 that
 they
 immediately
 took
 up
 stones
 with
 the
 intent
 of
 killing
 Him
 The
 Jews
 regarded
 Jehovah
 as
 an
 ineffable
 name
 not
 to
 be
 spoken
 they
 substituted
 for
 it
 the
 sacred
 though
 to
 them
 the
 notforbidden
 name
 Adonai
 signifying
 the
 Lord
 The
 original
 of
 the
 terms
 Lord
 and
 God
 as
 they
 appear
 in
 the
 Old
 Testament
 was
 either
 Yahveh
 or
 Adonai
 and
 the
 divine
 Being
 designated
 by
 these
 sacred
 names
 was
 as
 shown
 by
 the
 scriptures
 cited
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 John
 evangelist
 and
 apostle
 positively
 identifies
 Jesus
 Christ
 with
 Adonai
 or
 the
 Lord
 who
 spoke
 through
 the
 voice
 of
 Isaiah
 and
 with
 Jehovah
 who
 spoke
 through
 Zechariah
 The
 name
 Elohim
 is
 of
 frequent
 occurrence
 in
 the
 Hebrew
 texts
 of
 the
 Old
 Testament
 though
 it
 is
 not
 found
 in
 our
 English
 versions
 In
 form
 the
 word
 is
 a
 Hebrew
 plural
 noun
 but
 it
 connotes
 the
 plurality
 of
 excellence
 or
 intensity
 rather
 than
 distinctively
 of
 number
 It
 is
 expressive
 of
 supreme
 or
 absolute
 exaltation
 and
 power

 proclaimed
 as

 Jacob
 the
 God
 who
 led
 Israel
 from
 the
 bondage
 of

 to
 the
 freedom
 of
 the
 promised
 land
 the
 one
 and
 only
 God
 known
 by
 direct
 and
 personal
 revelation
 to
 the
 Hebrew
 prophets
 in
 general
 The
 identity
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 with
 the
 Jehovah
 of
 the
 Israelites
 was
 well
 understood
 by
 the
 Nephite
 prophets
 and
 the
 truth
 of
 their
 teachings
 was
 confirmed
 by
 the
 risen
 Lord
 who
 manifested
 Himself
 unto
 them
 shortly
 after
 His
 ascension
 from
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 apostles
 at
 Jerusalem
 This
 is
 the
 record
 And
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 that
 the
 Lord
 spake
 unto
 them
 saying
 Arise
 and
 come
 forth
 unto
 me
 that
 ye
 may
 thrust
 your
 hands
 into
 my
 side
 and
 also
 that
 ye
 may
 feel
 the
 prints
 of
 the
 nails
 in
 my
 hands
 and
 in
 my
 feet
 that
 ye
 may
 know
 that
 I
 am
 the
 God
 of
 Israel
 and
 the
 God
 of
 the
 whole
 earth
 and
 have
 been
 slain
 for
 the
 sins
 of
 the
 world
 It
 would
 appear
 unnecessary
 to
 cite
 at
 greater
 length
 in
 substantiating
 our
 affirmation
 that
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 God
 even
 before
 He
 assumed
 a
 body
 of
 flesh
 During
 that
 antemortal
 period
 there
 was
 essential
 difference
 between
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Son
 in
 that
 the
 former
 had
 already
 passed
 through
 the
 experiences
 of
 mortal
 life
 including
 death
 and
 resurrection
 and
 was
 therefore
 a
 Being
 possessed
 of
 a
 perfect
 immortalized
 body
 of
 flesh
 and
 bones
 while
 the
 Son
 was
 yet
 unembodied
 Through
 His
 death
 and
 subsequent
 resurrection
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 is
 today
 a
 Being
 like
 unto
 the
 Father
 in
 all
 essential
 characteristics
 A
 general
 consideration
 of
 scriptural
 evidence
 leads
 to
 the
 conclusion
 that
 God
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 has
 manifested
 Himself
 to
 earthly
 prophets
 or
 revelators
 on
 very
 few
 occasions
 and
 then
 principally
 to
 attest
 the
 divine
 authority
 of
 His
 Son
 Jesus
 Christ
 As
 before
 shown
 the
 Son
 was
 the
 active
 executive
 in
 the
 work
 of
 creation
 throughout
 the
 creative
 scenes
 the
 Father
 appears
 mostly
 in
 a
 directing
 or
 consulting
 capacity
 Unto
 Adam
 Enoch
 Noah
 Abraham
 and
 Moses
 the
 Father
 revealed
 Himself
 attesting
 the
 Godship
 of
 the
 Christ
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 Son
 was
 the
 chosen
 Savior
 of
 mankind
 On
 the
 occasion
 of
 the
 baptism
 of
 Jesus
 the
 Fathers
 voice
 was
 heard
 saying
 This
 is
 my
 beloved
 Son
 in
 whom
 I
 am
 well
 pleased
 and
 at
 the
 transfiguration
 a
 similar
 testimony
 was
 given
 by
 the
 Father
 On
 an
 occasion
 yet
 later
 while
 Jesus
 prayed
 in
 anguish
 of
 soul
 submitting
 Himself
 that
 the
 Fathers
 purposes
 be
 fulfilled
 and
 the
 Fathers
 name
 glorified
 Then
 came
 there
 a
 voice
 from
 heaven
 saying
 I
 have
 both
 glorified
 it
 and
 will
 glorify
 it
 again
 The
 resurrected
 and
 glorified
 Christ
 was
 announced
 by
 the
 Father
 to
 the
 Nephites
 on
 the
 western
 hemisphere
 in
 these
 words
 Behold
 my
 beloved
 Son
 in
 whom
 I
 am
 well
 pleased
 in
 whom
 I
 have
 glorified
 my
 name
 hear
 ye
 him
 From
 the
 time
 of
 the
 occurrence
 last
 noted
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 Father
 was
 not
 heard
 again
 among
 men
 so
 far
 as
 the
 scriptures
 aver
 until
 the
 spring
 of
 
 when
 both
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Son
 ministered
 unto
 the
 prophet
 Joseph
 Smith
 the
 Father
 saying
 This
 is
 my
 beloved
 Son
 hear
 him
 These
 are
 the
 instances
 of
 record
 in
 which
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 has
 been
 manifest
 in
 personal
 utterance
 or
 other
 revelation
 to
 man
 apart
 from
 the
 Son
 God
 the
 Creator
 the
 Jehovah
 of
 Israel
 the
 Savior
 and
 Redeemer
 of
 all
 nations
 kindreds
 and
 tongues
 are
 the
 same
 and
 He
 is
 Jesus
 the
 Christ

 A
 Little
 
 Jehovah
 a
 Name
 Not
 Uttered
 by
 the
 JewsLong
 prior
 to
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 certain
 schools
 among
 the
 Jews
 ever
 intent
 on
 the
 observance
 of
 the
 letter
 of
 the
 law
 though
 not
 without
 disregard
 of
 its
 spirit
 had
 taught
 that
 the
 mere
 utterance
 of
 the
 name
 of
 God
 was
 blasphemous
 and
 that
 the
 sin
 of
 so
 doing
 constituted
 a
 capital
 offense
 This
 extreme
 conception
 arose
 from
 the
 accepted
 though
 uninspired
 interpretation
 of
 Lev
 
 And
 he
 that
 blasphemeth
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Lord
 he
 shall
 surely
 be
 put
 to
 death
 and
 all
 the
 congregation
 shall
 certainly
 stone
 him

 Jehovah
 The
 true
 pronunciation
 of
 this
 name
 Yehovah
 by
 which
 God
 was
 known
 to
 the
 Hebrews
 has
 been
 entirely
 lost
 the
 Jews
 themselves
 scrupulously
 avoiding
 every
 mention
 of
 it
 and
 substituting
 in
 its
 stead
 one
 or
 other
 of
 the
 words
 with
 whose
 proper
 vowelpoints
 it
 may
 happen
 to
 be
 written
 Adonai
 Lord
 or
 Elohim
 God
 According
 to
 Jewish
 tradition
 it
 was
 pronounced
 but
 once
 a
 year
 by
 the
 high
 priest
 on
 the
 day
 of
 atonement
 when
 he
 entered
 the
 Holy
 of
 Holies

 is

 CHAPTER
 
 EARTHLY
 ADVENT
 OF
 THE
 CHRIST
 PREDICTED
 The
 coming
 of
 Christ
 to
 earth
 to
 tabernacle
 in
 the
 flesh
 was
 no
 unexpected
 or
 unheralded
 event
 For
 centuries
 prior
 to
 the
 great
 occurrence
 the
 Jews
 had
 professed
 to
 be
 looking
 for
 the
 advent
 of
 their
 King
 and
 in
 the
 appointed
 ceremonials
 of
 worship
 as
 in
 private
 devotions
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 promised
 Messiah
 was
 prominent
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 the
 supplication
 of
 Israel
 to
 Jehovah
 True
 there
 was
 much
 diversity
 in
 lay
 opinion
 and
 in
 rabbinical
 exposition
 as
 to
 the
 time
 and
 manner
 of
 His
 appearing
 but
 the
 certainty
 thereof
 was
 fundamentally
 established
 in
 the
 beliefs
 and
 hopes
 of
 the
 Hebrew
 nation
 The
 records
 known
 to
 us
 as
 the
 books
 of
 the
 Old
 Testament
 together
 with
 other
 inspired
 writings
 once
 regarded
 as
 authentic
 but
 excluded
 from
 later
 compilations
 as
 not
 strictly
 canonical
 were
 current
 among
 the
 Hebrews
 at
 and
 long
 before
 the
 time
 of
 Christs
 birth
 These
 scriptures
 had
 their
 beginning
 in
 the
 proclamation
 of
 the
 law
 through
 Moses
 who
 wrote
 the
 same
 and
 delivered
 the
 writing
 into
 the
 official
 custody
 of
 the
 priests
 with
 an
 express
 command
 that
 it
 be
 read
 in
 the
 assemblies
 of
 the
 people
 at
 stated
 times
 To
 these
 earlier
 writings
 were
 added
 the
 utterances
 of
 divinely
 commissioned
 prophets
 the
 records
 of
 appointed
 historians
 and
 the
 songs
 of
 inspired
 poets
 as
 the
 centuries
 passed
 so
 that
 at
 the
 time
 of
 our
 Lords
 ministry
 the
 Jews
 possessed
 a
 great
 accumulation
 of
 writings
 accepted
 and
 revered
 by
 them
 as
 authoritative
 These
 records
 are
 rich
 in
 prediction
 and
 promise
 respecting
 the
 earthly
 advent
 of
 the
 Messiah
 as
 are
 other
 scriptures
 to
 which
 the
 Israel
 of
 old
 had
 not
 access
 Adam
 the
 patriarch
 of
 the
 race
 rejoiced
 in
 the
 assurance
 of
 the
 Saviors
 appointed
 ministry
 through
 the
 acceptance
 of
 which
 he
 the
 transgressor
 might
 gain
 redemption
 Brief
 mention
 of
 the
 plan
 of
 salvation
 the
 author
 of
 which
 is
 Jesus
 Christ
 appears
 in
 the
 promise
 given
 of
 God
 following
 the
 fallthat
 though
 the
 devil
 represented
 by
 the
 serpent
 in
 Eden
 should
 have
 power
 to
 bruise
 the
 heel
 of
 Adams
 posterity
 through
 the
 seed
 of
 the
 woman
 should
 come
 the
 power
 to
 bruise
 the
 adversarys
 head
 It
 is
 significant
 that
 this
 assurance
 of
 eventual
 victory
 over
 sin
 and
 its
 inevitable
 effect
 death
 both
 of
 which
 were
 introduced
 to
 earth
 through
 Satan
 the
 archenemy
 of
 mankind
 was
 to
 be
 realized
 through
 the
 offspring
 of
 woman
 the
 promise
 was
 not
 made
 specifically
 to
 the
 man
 nor
 to
 the
 pair
 The
 only
 instance
 of
 offspring
 from
 woman
 dissociated
 from
 mortal
 fatherhood
 is
 the
 birth
 of
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 who
 was
 the
 earthly
 Son
 of
 a
 mortal
 mother
 begotten
 by
 an
 immortal
 Father
 He
 is
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 of
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 in
 the
 flesh
 and
 was
 born
 of
 woman
 Through
 scriptures
 other
 than
 those
 embodied
 in
 the
 Old
 Testament
 we
 learn
 with
 greater
 fulness
 of
 the
 revelations
 of
 God
 to
 Adam
 respecting
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Redeemer
 As
 a
 natural
 and
 inevitable
 result
 of
 his
 disobedience
 Adam
 had
 forfeited
 the
 high
 privilege
 he
 once
 enjoyedthat
 of
 holding
 direct
 and
 personal
 association
 with
 his
 God
 nevertheless
 in
 his
 fallen
 state
 he
 was
 visited
 by
 an
 angel
 of
 the
 Lord
 who
 revealed
 unto
 him
 the
 plan
 of
 redemption
 And
 after
 many
 days
 an
 angel
 of
 the
 Lord
 appeared
 unto
 Adam
 saying
 Why
 dost
 thou
 offer
 sacrifices
 unto
 the
 Lord
 And
 Adam
 said
 unto
 him
 I
 know
 not
 save
 the
 Lord
 commanded
 me
 And
 then
 the
 angel
 spake
 saying
 This
 thing
 is
 a
 similitude
 of
 the
 sacrifice
 of
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 of
 the
 Father
 which
 is
 full
 of
 grace
 and
 truth
 Wherefore
 thou
 shalt
 do
 all
 that
 thou
 doest
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Son
 and
 thou
 shalt
 repent
 and
 call
 upon
 God
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Son
 for
 evermore
 And
 in
 that
 day
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 fell
 upon
 Adam
 which
 beareth
 record
 of
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Son
 saying
 I
 am
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 of
 the
 Father
 from
 the
 beginning
 henceforth
 and
 for
 ever
 that
 as
 thou
 hast
 fallen
 thou
 mayest
 be
 redeemed
 and
 all
 mankind
 even
 as
 many
 as
 will
 The
 Lords
 revelation
 to
 Adam
 making
 known
 the
 ordained
 plan
 whereby
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 was
 to
 take
 upon
 Himself
 flesh
 in
 the
 meridian
 of
 time
 and
 become
 the
 Redeemer
 of
 the
 world
 was
 attested
 by
 Enoch
 son
 of
 Jared
 and
 father
 of
 Methuselah
 From
 the
 words
 of
 Enoch
 we
 learn
 that
 to
 him
 as
 to
 his
 great
 progenitor
 Adam
 the
 very
 name
 by
 which
 the
 Savior
 would
 be
 known
 among
 men
 was
 revealedwhich
 is
 Jesus
 Christ
 the
 only
 name
 which
 shall
 be
 given
 under
 heaven
 whereby
 salvation
 shall
 come
 unto
 the
 children
 of
 men
 The
 recorded
 covenant
 of
 God
 with
 Abraham
 and
 the
 reiteration
 and
 confirmation
 thereof
 with
 Isaac
 and
 in
 turn
 with
 Jacobthat
 through
 their
 posterity
 should
 all
 nations
 of
 the
 earth
 be
 blessedpresaged
 the
 birth
 of
 the
 Redeemer
 through
 that
 chosen
 lineage
 Its
 fulfilment
 is
 the
 blessed
 heritage
 of
 the
 ages
 In
 pronouncing
 his
 patriarchal
 blessing
 upon
 the
 head
 of
 Judah
 Jacob
 prophesied
 The
 sceptre
 shall
 not
 depart
 from
 Judah
 nor
 a
 lawgiver
 from
 between
 his
 feet
 until
 Shiloh
 come
 and
 unto
 him
 shall
 the
 gathering
 of
 the
 people
 be
 That
 by
 Shiloh
 is
 meant
 the
 Christ
 is
 evidenced
 by
 the
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 conditions
 set
 forth
 in
 the
 prediction
 in
 the
 state
 of
 the
 Jewish
 nation
 at
 the
 time
 of
 our
 Lords
 birth
 Moses
 proclaimed
 the
 coming
 of
 a
 great
 Prophet
 in
 Israel
 whose
 ministry
 was
 to
 be
 of
 such
 importance
 that
 all
 men
 who
 would
 not
 accept
 Him
 would
 be
 under
 condemnation
 and
 that
 this
 prediction
 had
 sole
 reference
 to
 Jesus
 Christ
 is
 conclusively
 shown
 by
 later
 scriptures
 Thus
 spake
 the
 Lord
 unto
 Moses
 I
 will
 raise
 them
 up
 a
 Prophet
 from
 among
 their
 brethren
 like
 unto
 thee
 and
 will
 put
 my
 words
 in
 his
 mouth
 and
 he
 shall
 speak
 unto
 them
 all
 that
 I
 shall
 command
 him
 And
 it
 shall
 come
 to
 pass
 that
 whosoever
 will
 not
 hearken
 unto
 my
 words
 which
 he
 shall
 speak
 in
 my
 name
 I
 will
 require
 it
 of
 him
 The
 system
 of
 sacrifice
 expressly
 enjoined
 in
 the
 Mosaic
 code
 was
 essentially
 a
 prototype
 of
 the
 sacrificial
 death
 to
 be
 accomplished
 by
 the
 Savior
 on
 Calvary
 The
 blood
 of
 countless
 altar
 victims
 slain
 by
 Israels
 priests
 in
 the
 course
 of
 prescribed
 ritual
 ran
 throughout
 the
 centuries
 from
 Moses
 to
 Christ
 as
 a
 prophetic
 flood
 in
 similitude
 of
 the
 blood
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 appointed
 to
 be
 shed
 as
 an
 expiatory
 sacrifice
 for
 the
 redemption
 of
 the
 race
 But
 as
 already
 shown
 the
 institution
 of
 bloody
 sacrifice
 as
 a
 type
 of
 the
 future
 death
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 dates
 from
 the
 beginning
 of
 human
 history
 since
 the
 offering
 of
 animal
 sacrifices
 through
 the
 shedding
 of
 blood
 was
 required
 of
 Adam
 to
 whom
 the
 significance
 of
 the
 ordinance
 as
 a
 similitude
 of
 the
 sacrifice
 of
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 of
 the
 Father
 was
 expressly
 defined
 The
 paschal
 lamb
 slain
 for
 every
 Israelitish
 household
 at
 the
 annually
 recurring
 feast
 of
 the
 Passover
 was
 a
 particular
 type
 of
 the
 Lamb
 of
 God
 who
 in
 due
 time
 would
 be
 slain
 for
 the
 sins
 of
 the
 world
 The
 crucifixion
 of
 Christ
 was
 effected
 at
 the
 Passover
 season
 and
 the
 consummation
 of
 the
 supreme
 Sacrifice
 of
 which
 the
 paschal
 lambs
 had
 been
 but
 lesser
 prototypes
 led
 Paul
 the
 apostle
 to
 affirm
 in
 later
 times
 For
 even
 Christ
 our
 passover
 is
 sacrificed
 for
 us
 Job
 in
 the
 day
 of
 dire
 affliction
 rejoiced
 in
 his
 testimony
 of
 the
 coming
 Messiah
 and
 declared
 with
 prophetic
 conviction
 I
 know
 that
 my
 redeemer
 liveth
 and
 that
 he
 shall
 stand
 at
 the
 latter
 day
 upon
 the
 earth
 The
 songs
 of
 David
 the
 psalmist
 abound
 in
 oftrecurring
 allusion
 to
 the
 earthly
 life
 of
 Christ
 many
 circumstances
 of
 which
 are
 described
 in
 detail
 and
 as
 to
 these
 corroboration
 of
 the
 utterances
 is
 found
 in
 New
 Testament
 scriptures
 Isaiah
 whose
 prophetic
 office
 was
 honored
 by
 the
 personal
 testimony
 of
 Christ
 and
 the
 apostles
 manifested
 in
 numerous
 passages
 the
 burden
 of
 his
 conviction
 relating
 to
 the
 great
 event
 of
 the
 Saviors
 advent
 and
 ministry
 on
 earth
 With
 the
 forcefulness
 of
 direct
 revelation
 he
 told
 of
 the
 Virgins
 divine
 maternity
 whereof
 Immanuel
 should
 be
 born
 and
 his
 prediction
 was
 reiterated
 by
 the
 angel
 of
 the
 Lord
 over
 seven
 centuries
 later
 Looking
 down
 through
 the
 ages
 the
 prophet
 saw
 the
 accomplishment
 of
 the
 divine
 purposes
 as
 if
 already
 achieved
 and
 sang
 in
 triumph
 For
 unto
 us
 a
 child
 is
 born
 unto
 us
 a
 son
 is
 given
 and
 the
 government
 shall
 be
 upon
 his
 shoulder
 and
 his
 name
 shall
 be
 called
 Wonderful
 Counselor
 The
 mighty
 God
 The
 everlasting
 Father
 The
 Prince
 of
 Peace
 Of
 the
 increase
 of
 his
 government
 and
 peace
 there
 shall
 be
 no
 end
 upon
 the
 throne
 of
 David
 and
 upon
 his
 kingdom
 to
 order
 it
 and
 to
 establish
 it
 with
 judgment
 and
 with
 justice
 from
 henceforth
 even
 forever
 Immediately
 prior
 to
 its
 fulfilment
 the
 blessed
 promise
 was
 repeated
 by
 Gabriel
 sent
 from
 the
 presence
 of
 God
 to
 the
 chosen
 Virgin
 of
 Nazareth
 As
 made
 known
 to
 the
 prophet
 and
 by
 him
 proclaimed
 the
 coming
 Lord
 was
 the
 living
 Branch
 that
 should
 spring
 from
 the
 undying
 root
 typified
 in
 the
 family
 of
 Jesse
 the
 foundation
 Stone
 insuring
 the
 stability
 of
 Zion
 the
 Shepherd
 of
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 the
 Light
 of
 the
 world
 to
 Gentile
 as
 well
 as
 Jew
 the
 Leader
 and
 Commander
 of
 His
 people
 The
 same
 inspired
 voice
 predicted
 the
 forerunner
 who
 should
 cry
 in
 the
 wilderness
 Prepare
 ye
 the
 way
 of
 the
 Lord
 make
 straight
 in
 the
 desert
 a
 highway
 for
 our
 God
 Isaiah
 was
 permitted
 to
 read
 the
 scroll
 of
 futurity
 as
 to
 many
 distinguishing
 conditions
 to
 attend
 the
 Messiahs
 lowly
 life
 and
 atoning
 death
 In
 Him
 the
 prophet
 saw
 One
 who
 would
 be
 despized
 and
 rejected
 of
 men
 a
 Man
 of
 sorrows
 acquainted
 with
 grief
 One
 to
 be
 wounded
 and
 bruised
 for
 the
 transgressions
 of
 the
 race
 on
 whom
 would
 be
 laid
 the
 iniquity
 of
 us
 alla
 patient
 and
 willing
 Sacrifice
 silent
 under
 affliction
 as
 a
 lamb
 brought
 to
 the
 slaughter
 The
 Lords
 dying
 with
 sinners
 and
 His
 burial
 in
 the
 tomb
 of
 the
 wealthy
 were
 likewise
 declared
 with
 prophetic
 certainty
 Unto
 Jeremiah
 came
 the
 word
 of
 the
 Lord
 in
 terms
 of
 plainness
 declaring
 the
 sure
 advent
 of
 the
 King
 by
 whom
 the
 safety
 of
 both
 Judah
 and
 Israel
 should
 be
 assured
 the
 Prince
 of
 the
 House
 of
 David
 through
 whom
 the
 divine
 promise
 to
 the
 son
 of
 Jesse
 should
 be
 realized
 Under
 the
 same
 spirit
 prophesied
 Ezekiel
 Hosea
 and
 Micah
 Zechariah
 broke
 off
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 fateful
 prediction
 to
 voice
 the
 glad
 song
 of
 thanksgiving
 and
 praise
 as
 he
 beheld
 in
 vision
 the
 simple
 pageantry
 of
 the
 Kings
 triumphal
 entry
 into
 the
 city
 of
 David
 Then
 the
 prophet
 bewailed
 the
 grief
 of
 the
 consciencesmitten
 nation
 by
 whom
 as
 was
 foreseen
 the
 Savior
 of
 humankind
 would
 be
 pierced
 even
 unto
 death
 and
 showed
 that
 when
 subdued
 by
 contrition
 His
 own
 people
 would
 ask
 What
 are
 these
 wounds
 in
 thy
 hands
 the
 Lord
 would
 answer
 Those
 with
 which
 I
 was
 wounded
 in
 the
 house
 of
 my
 friends
 The
 very
 price
 to
 be
 paid
 for
 the
 betrayal
 of
 the
 Christ
 to
 His
 death
 was
 foretold
 as
 in
 parable
 The
 fact
 that
 these
 predictions
 of
 the
 Old
 Testament
 prophets
 had
 reference
 to
 Jesus
 Christ
 and
 to
 Him
 only
 is
 put
 beyond
 question
 by
 the
 attestation
 of
 the
 resurrected
 Lord
 To
 the
 assembled
 apostles
 He
 said
 These
 are
 the
 words
 which
 I
 spake
 unto
 you
 while
 I
 was
 yet
 with
 you
 that
 all
 things
 must
 be
 fulfilled
 which
 were
 written
 in
 the
 law
 of
 Moses
 and
 in
 the
 prophets
 and
 in
 the
 psalms
 concerning
 me
 Then
 opened
 he
 their
 understanding
 that
 they
 might
 understand
 the
 scriptures
 and
 said
 unto
 them
 Thus
 it
 is
 written
 and
 thus
 it
 behoved
 Christ
 to
 suffer
 and
 to
 rise
 from
 the
 dead
 the
 third
 day
 John
 the
 Baptist
 whose
 ministry
 immediately
 preceded
 that
 of
 the
 Christ
 proclaimed
 the
 coming
 of
 One
 mightier
 than
 himself
 One
 who
 should
 baptize
 with
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 and
 specifically
 identified
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 as
 that
 One
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 the
 Lamb
 who
 should
 assume
 the
 burden
 of
 the
 worlds
 sins
 The
 predictions
 thus
 far
 cited
 as
 relating
 to
 the
 life
 ministry
 and
 death
 of
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 are
 the
 utterances
 of
 prophets
 who
 excepting
 Adam
 and
 Enoch
 lived
 and
 died
 on
 the
 eastern
 hemisphere
 All
 save
 John
 the
 Baptist
 are
 of
 Old
 Testament
 record
 and
 he
 a
 contemporary
 of
 the
 Christ
 in
 mortality
 figures
 in
 the
 early
 chapters
 of
 the
 Gospels
 It
 is
 important
 to
 know
 that
 the
 scriptures
 of
 the
 western
 hemisphere
 are
 likewise
 explicit
 in
 the
 declaration
 of
 the
 great
 truth
 that
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 would
 be
 born
 in
 the
 flesh
 The
 Book
 of
 Mormon
 contains
 a
 history
 of
 a
 colony
 of
 Israelites
 of
 the
 tribe
 of
 Joseph
 who
 left
 Jerusalem
 
 BC
 during
 the
 reign
 of
 Zedekiah
 king
 of
 Judah
 on
 the
 eve
 of
 the
 subjugation
 of
 Judea
 by
 Nebuchadnezzar
 and
 the
 inauguration
 of
 the
 Babylonian
 captivity
 This
 colony
 was
 led
 by
 divine
 guidance
 to
 the
 American
 continent
 whereon
 they
 developed
 into
 a
 numerous
 and
 mighty
 people
 though
 divided
 by
 dissension
 they
 formed
 two
 opposing
 nations
 known
 respectively
 as
 Nephites
 and
 Lamanites
 The
 former
 cultivated
 the
 arts
 of
 industry
 and
 refinement
 and
 preserved
 a
 record
 embodying
 both
 history
 and
 scripture
 while
 the
 latter
 became
 degenerate
 and
 debased
 The
 Nephites
 suffered
 extinction
 about
 
 AD
 but
 the
 Lamanites
 lived
 on
 in
 their
 degraded
 course
 and
 are
 today
 extant
 upon
 the
 land
 as
 the
 American
 Indians
 The
 Nephite
 annals
 from
 the
 beginning
 thereof
 down
 to
 the
 time
 of
 our
 Lords
 birth
 abound
 in
 prediction
 and
 promise
 of
 the
 Christ
 and
 this
 chronicle
 is
 followed
 by
 a
 record
 of
 the
 actual
 visitation
 of
 the
 resurrected
 Savior
 to
 the
 Nephites
 and
 the
 establishment
 of
 His
 Church
 among
 them
 Unto
 Lehi
 the
 leader
 of
 the
 colony
 the
 Lord
 revealed
 the
 time
 place
 and
 manner
 of
 Christs
 then
 future
 advent
 together
 with
 many
 important
 facts
 of
 His
 ministry
 and
 the
 preparatory
 work
 of
 John
 the
 forerunner
 This
 revelation
 was
 given
 while
 the
 company
 was
 journeying
 in
 the
 wilderness
 of
 Arabia
 prior
 to
 their
 crossing
 the
 great
 waters
 The
 prophecy
 is
 thus
 written
 by
 Nephi
 a
 son
 of
 Lehi
 and
 his
 successor
 in
 the
 prophetic
 calling
 Yea
 even
 six
 hundred
 years
 from
 the
 time
 that
 my
 father
 left
 Jerusalem
 a
 prophet
 would
 the
 Lord
 God
 raise
 up
 among
 the
 Jews
 even
 a
 Messiah
 or
 in
 other
 words
 a
 Savior
 of
 the
 world
 And
 he
 also
 spake
 concerning
 the
 prophets
 how
 great
 a
 number
 had
 testified
 of
 these
 things
 concerning
 this
 Messiah
 of
 whom
 he
 had
 spoken
 or
 this
 Redeemer
 of
 the
 world
 Wherefore
 all
 mankind
 were
 in
 a
 lost
 and
 in
 a
 fallen
 state
 and
 ever
 would
 be
 save
 they
 should
 rely
 on
 this
 Redeemer
 And
 he
 spake
 also
 concerning
 a
 prophet
 who
 should
 come
 before
 the
 Messiah
 to
 prepare
 the
 way
 of
 the
 Lord
 yea
 even
 he
 should
 go
 forth
 and
 cry
 in
 the
 wilderness
 Prepare
 ye
 the
 way
 of
 the
 Lord
 and
 make
 his
 paths
 straight
 for
 there
 standeth
 one
 among
 you
 whom
 ye
 know
 not
 and
 he
 is
 mightier
 than
 I
 whose
 shoes
 latchet
 I
 am
 not
 worthy
 to
 unloose
 And
 much
 spake
 my
 father
 concerning
 this
 thing
 And
 my
 father
 said
 he
 should
 baptize
 in
 Bethabara
 beyond
 Jordan
 and
 he
 also
 said
 he
 should
 baptize
 with
 water
 even
 that
 he
 should
 baptize
 the
 Messiah
 with
 water
 And
 after
 he
 had
 baptized
 the
 Messiah
 with
 water
 he
 should
 behold
 and
 bear
 record
 that
 he
 had
 baptized
 the
 Lamb
 of
 God
 who
 should
 take
 away
 the
 sins
 of
 the
 world
 And
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 after
 my
 father
 had
 spoken
 these
 words
 he
 spake
 unto
 my
 brethren
 concerning
 the
 gospel
 which
 should
 be
 preached
 among
 the
 Jews
 and
 also
 concerning
 the
 dwindling
 of
 the
 Jews
 in
 unbelief
 And
 after
 they
 had
 slain
 the
 Messiah
 who
 should
 come
 and
 after
 he
 had
 been
 slain
 he
 should
 rise
 from
 the
 dead
 and
 should
 make
 himself
 manifest
 by
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 unto
 the
 Gentiles
 At
 a
 later
 time
 Nephi
 writes
 not
 as
 his
 fathers
 scribe
 but
 as
 a
 prophet
 and
 revelator
 voicing
 the
 word
 of
 God
 as
 made
 known
 to
 himself
 He
 was
 permitted
 to
 behold
 in
 vision
 and
 to
 declare
 to
 his
 people
 the
 circumstances
 of
 the
 Messiahs
 birth
 His
 baptism
 by
 John
 and
 the
 ministration
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 with
 its
 accompanying
 sign
 of
 the
 dove
 he
 beheld
 our
 Lord
 moving
 as
 a
 Teacher
 of
 righteousness
 among
 the
 people
 healing
 the
 afflicted
 and
 rebuking
 spirits
 of
 evil
 he
 saw
 and
 bore
 record
 of
 the
 dread
 scenes
 of
 Calvary
 he
 beheld
 and
 predicted
 the
 calling
 of
 the
 chosen
 Twelve
 the
 apostles
 of
 the
 Lamb
 for
 so
 these
 were
 designated
 by
 Him
 who
 vouchsafed
 the
 vision
 Moreover
 he
 told
 of
 the
 iniquity
 of
 the
 Jews
 who
 were
 seen
 in
 contention
 with
 the
 apostles
 and
 thus
 concludes
 the
 portentous
 prophecy
 And
 the
 angel
 of
 the
 Lord
 spake
 unto
 me
 again
 saying
 Thus
 shall
 be
 the
 destruction
 of
 all
 nations
 kindreds
 tongues
 and
 people
 that
 shall
 fight
 against
 the
 twelve
 apostles
 of
 the
 Lamb
 Soon
 after
 the
 defection
 whereby
 the
 distinction
 between
 Nephites
 and
 Lamanites
 was
 established
 Jacob
 a
 brother
 of
 Nephi
 continued
 in
 prophecy
 of
 the
 assured
 coming
 of
 the
 Messiah
 specifically
 declaring
 that
 He
 would
 minister
 at
 Jerusalem
 and
 affirming
 the
 necessity
 of
 His
 atoning
 death
 as
 the
 ordained
 means
 of
 human
 redemption
 The
 prophet
 Abinadi
 in
 his
 fearless
 denunciation
 of
 sin
 to
 the
 wicked
 king
 Noah
 preached
 the
 Christ
 who
 was
 to
 come
 and
 righteous
 Benjamin
 who
 was
 at
 once
 prophet
 and
 king
 proclaimed
 the
 same
 great
 truth
 to
 his
 people
 about
 
 BC
 So
 taught
 Alma
 in
 his
 inspired
 admonition
 to
 his
 wayward
 son
 Corianton
 and
 so
 also
 Amulek
 in
 his
 contention
 with
 Zeezrom
 So
 proclaimed
 the
 Lamanite
 prophet
 Samuel
 only
 five
 years
 prior
 to
 the
 actual
 occurrence
 furthermore
 he
 specified
 the
 signs
 by
 which
 the
 birth
 of
 Jesus
 in
 Judea
 would
 be
 made
 known
 to
 the
 people
 of
 the
 western
 world
 Said
 he
 Behold
 I
 give
 unto
 you
 a
 sign
 for
 five
 years
 more
 cometh
 and
 behold
 then
 cometh
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 to
 redeem
 all
 those
 who
 shall
 believe
 on
 his
 name
 And
 behold
 this
 will
 I
 give
 unto
 you
 for
 a
 sign
 at
 the
 time
 of
 his
 coming
 for
 behold
 there
 shall
 be
 great
 lights
 in
 heaven
 insomuch
 that
 in
 the
 night
 before
 he
 cometh
 there
 shall
 be
 no
 darkness
 insomuch
 that
 it
 shall
 appear
 unto
 man
 as
 if
 it
 was
 day
 therefore
 there
 shall
 be
 one
 day
 and
 a
 night
 and
 a
 day
 as
 if
 it
 were
 one
 day
 and
 there
 were
 no
 night
 and
 this
 shall
 be
 unto
 you
 for
 a
 sign
 for
 ye
 shall
 know
 of
 the
 rising
 of
 the
 sun
 and
 also
 of
 its
 setting
 therefore
 they
 shall
 know
 of
 a
 surety
 that
 there
 shall
 be
 two
 days
 and
 a
 night
 nevertheless
 the
 night
 shall
 not
 be
 darkened
 and
 it
 shall
 be
 the
 night
 before
 he
 is
 born
 And
 behold
 there
 shall
 a
 new
 star
 arise
 such
 an
 one
 as
 ye
 never
 have
 beheld
 and
 this
 also
 shall
 be
 a
 sign
 unto
 you
 And
 behold
 this
 is
 not
 all
 there
 shall
 be
 many
 signs
 and
 wonders
 in
 heaven
 Thus
 the
 scriptures
 of
 both
 hemispheres
 and
 in
 all
 ages
 of
 antemeridian
 time
 bore
 solemn
 testimony
 to
 the
 certainty
 of
 Messiahs
 advent
 thus
 the
 holy
 prophets
 of
 old
 voiced
 the
 word
 of
 revelation
 predicting
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 worlds
 King
 and
 Lord
 through
 whom
 alone
 is
 salvation
 provided
 and
 redemption
 from
 death
 made
 sure
 It
 is
 a
 characteristic
 of
 prophets
 sent
 of
 God
 that
 they
 possess
 and
 proclaim
 a
 personal
 assurance
 of
 the
 Christ
 for
 the
 testimony
 of
 Jesus
 is
 the
 spirit
 of
 prophecy
 Not
 a
 word
 of
 inspired
 prophecy
 relating
 to
 the
 great
 event
 has
 been
 found
 void
 The
 literal
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 predictions
 is
 ample
 attestation
 of
 their
 origin
 in
 divine
 revelation
 and
 proof
 conclusive
 of
 the
 divinity
 of
 Him
 whose
 coming
 was
 so
 abundantly
 foretold
 NOTES

 CHAPTER
 
 
 The
 Antiquity
 of
 Sacrifice
 as
 a
 Prototype
 of
 Christs
 Atoning
 DeathWhile
 the
 Biblical
 record
 expressly
 attests
 the
 offering
 of
 sacrifices
 long
 prior
 to
 Israels
 exodus
 from
 Egypteg
 by
 Abel
 and
 by
 Cain
 Gen
 
 
 by
 Noah
 after
 the
 deluge
 Gen
 
 by
 Abraham
 Gen
 
 
 by
 Jacob
 Gen
 
 it
 is
 silent
 concerning
 the
 divine
 origin
 of
 sacrifice
 as
 a
 propitiatory
 requirement
 prefiguring
 the
 atoning
 death
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 The
 difficulty
 of
 determining
 time
 and
 circumstance
 under
 which
 the
 offering
 of
 symbolical
 sacrifices
 originated
 amongst
 mankind
 is
 recognized
 by
 all
 investigators
 save
 those
 who
 admit
 the
 validity
 of
 modern
 revelation
 The
 necessity
 of
 assuming
 early
 instruction
 from
 God
 to
 man
 on
 the
 subject
 has
 been
 asserted
 by
 many
 Bible
 scholars
 Thus
 the
 writer
 of
 the
 article
 Sacrifice
 in
 the
 Cassell
 Bible
 Dictionary
 says
 The
 idea
 of
 sacrifice
 is
 prominent
 throughout
 the
 scriptures
 and
 one
 of
 the
 most
 ancient
 and
 widely
 recognized
 in
 the
 rites
 of
 religion
 throughout
 the
 world
 There
 is
 also
 a
 remarkable
 similarity
 in
 the
 developments
 and
 applications
 of
 the
 idea
 On
 these
 and
 other
 accounts
 it
 has
 been
 judiciously
 inferred
 that
 sacrifice
 formed
 an
 element
 in
 the
 primeval
 worship
 of
 man
 and
 that
 its
 universality
 is
 not
 merely
 an
 indirect
 argument
 for
 the
 unity
 of
 the
 human
 race
 but
 an
 illustration
 and
 confirmation
 of
 the
 first
 inspired
 pages
 of
 the
 worlds
 history
 The
 notion
 of
 sacrifice
 can
 hardly
 be
 viewed
 as
 a
 product
 of
 unassisted
 human
 nature
 and
 must
 therefore
 be
 traced
 to
 a
 higher
 source
 and
 viewed
 as
 a
 divine
 revelation
 to
 primitive
 man
 Smiths
 Dic
 of
 the
 Bible
 presents
 the
 following
 In
 tracing
 the
 history
 of
 sacrifice
 from
 its
 first
 beginning
 to
 its
 perfect
 development
 in
 the
 Mosaic
 ritual
 we
 are
 at
 once
 met
 by
 the
 longdisputed
 question
 as
 to
 the
 origin
 of
 sacrifice
 whether
 it
 arose
 from
 a
 natural
 instinct
 of
 man
 sanctioned
 and
 guided
 by
 God
 or
 was
 the
 subject
 of
 some
 distinct
 primeval
 revelation
 There
 can
 be
 no
 doubt
 that
 sacrifice
 was
 sanctioned
 by
 Gods
 Law
 with
 a
 special
 typical
 reference
 to
 the
 Atonement
 of
 Christ
 its
 universal
 prevalence
 independent
 of
 and
 often
 opposed
 to
 mans
 natural
 reasonings
 on
 his
 relation
 to
 God
 shows
 it
 to
 have
 been
 primeval
 and
 deeply
 rooted
 in
 the
 instincts
 of
 humanity
 Whether
 it
 was
 first
 enjoined
 by
 an
 external
 command
 or
 was
 based
 on
 that
 sense
 of
 sin
 and
 lost
 communion
 with
 God
 which
 is
 stamped
 by
 His
 hand
 on
 the
 heart
 of
 manis
 an
 historical
 question
 perhaps
 insoluble
 The
 difficulty
 vanishes
 and
 the
 historical
 question
 as
 to
 the
 origin
 of
 sacrifice
 is
 definitely
 solved
 by
 the
 revelations
 of
 God
 in
 the
 current
 dispensation
 whereby
 parts
 of
 the
 record
 of
 Mosesnot
 contained
 in
 the
 Biblehave
 been
 restored
 to
 human
 knowledge
 The
 scripture
 quoted
 in
 the
 text
 pp
 
 
 makes
 clear
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 offering
 of
 sacrifices
 was
 required
 of
 Adam
 after
 his
 transgression
 and
 that
 the
 significance
 of
 the
 divinely
 established
 requirement
 was
 explained
 in
 fulness
 to
 the
 patriarch
 of
 the
 race
 The
 shedding
 of
 the
 blood
 of
 animals
 in
 sacrifice
 to
 God
 as
 a
 prototype
 of
 the
 sacrifice
 of
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 of
 the
 Father
 dates
 from
 the
 time
 immediately
 following
 the
 fall
 Its
 origin
 is
 based
 on
 a
 specific
 revelation
 to
 Adam

 Jacobs
 Prophecy
 Concerning
 ShilohThe
 prediction
 of
 the
 patriarch
 Jacobthat
 the
 sceptre
 should
 not
 depart
 from
 Judah
 before
 the
 coming
 of
 Shilohhas
 given
 rise
 to
 much
 disputation
 among
 Bible
 students
 Some
 insist
 that
 Shiloh
 is
 the
 name
 of
 a
 place
 and
 not
 that
 of
 a
 person
 That
 there
 was
 a
 place
 known
 by
 that
 name
 is
 beyond
 question
 see
 Josh
 
 
 
 
 
 Sam
 
 Jer
 
 but
 the
 name
 occurring
 in
 Gen
 
 is
 plainly
 that
 of
 a
 person
 It
 should
 be
 known
 that
 the
 use
 of
 the
 word
 in
 the
 King
 James
 or
 authorized
 version
 of
 the
 Bible
 is
 held
 to
 be
 correct
 by
 many
 eminent
 authorities
 Thus
 in
 Dummelows
 Commentary
 on
 the
 Holy
 Bible
 we
 read
 This
 verse
 has
 always
 been
 regarded
 by
 both
 Jews
 and
 Christians
 as
 a
 remarkable
 prophecy
 of
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Messiah
 On
 the
 rendering
 given
 above
 the
 whole
 verse
 foretells
 that
 Judah
 would
 retain
 authority
 until
 the
 advent
 of
 the
 rightful
 ruler
 the
 Messiah
 to
 whom
 all
 peoples
 would
 gather
 And
 broadly
 speaking
 it
 may
 be
 said
 that
 the
 last
 traces
 of
 Jewish
 legislative
 power
 as
 vested
 in
 the
 Sanhedrin
 did
 not
 disappear
 until
 the
 coming
 of
 Christ
 and
 the
 destruction
 of
 Jerusalem
 from
 which
 time
 His
 kingdom
 was
 set
 up
 among
 men
 Adam
 Clarke
 in
 his
 exhaustive
 Bible
 Commentary
 briefly
 analyzes
 the
 objections
 urged
 against
 the
 admissibility
 of
 this
 passage
 as
 applying
 to
 the
 Messiahs
 advent
 and
 dismisses
 them
 all
 as
 unfounded
 His
 conclusion
 as
 to
 the
 meaning
 of
 the
 passage
 is
 thus
 worded
 Judah
 shall
 continue
 a
 distinct
 tribe
 until
 the
 Messiah
 shall
 come
 and
 it
 did
 so
 and
 after
 His
 coming
 it
 was
 confounded
 with
 the
 others
 so
 that
 all
 distinction
 has
 been
 ever
 since
 lost
 Prof
 Douglas
 as
 cited
 in
 Smiths
 Dictionary
 claims
 that
 something
 of
 Judahs
 sceptre
 still
 remained
 a
 total
 eclipse
 being
 no
 proof
 that
 the
 day
 is
 at
 an
 endthat
 the
 proper
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 prophecy
 did
 not
 begin
 till
 Davids
 time
 and
 is
 consummated
 in
 Christ
 according
 to
 Luke
 
 
 The
 accepted
 meaning
 of
 the
 word
 by
 derivation
 is
 Peaceable
 and
 this
 is
 applicable
 to
 the
 attributes
 of
 the
 Christ
 who
 in
 Isa
 
 is
 designated
 the
 Prince
 of
 Peace
 Eusebius
 who
 lived
 between
 
 and
 
 AD
 and
 is
 known
 in
 ecclesiastical
 history
 as
 Bishop
 of
 Csarea
 wrote
 At
 the
 time
 that
 Herod
 was
 king
 who
 was
 the
 first
 foreigner
 that
 reigned
 over
 the
 Jewish
 people
 the
 prophecy
 recorded
 by
 Moses
 received
 its
 fulfilment
 viz
 That
 a
 prince
 should
 not
 fail
 of
 Judah
 nor
 a
 ruler
 from
 his
 loins
 until
 He
 should
 come
 for
 whom
 it
 is
 reserved
 the
 expectation
 of
 nations
 The
 quoted
 passage
 is
 founded
 on
 the
 Septuagint
 rendering
 of
 Genesis
 
 Some
 critics
 have
 held
 that
 in
 Jacobs
 use
 of
 the
 word
 Shiloh
 he
 did
 not
 intend
 it
 as
 a
 name
 or
 proper
 noun
 at
 all
 The
 writer
 of
 the
 article
 Shiloh
 in
 Cassells
 Bible
 Dictionary
 says
 The
 preponderance
 of
 evidence
 is
 in
 favor
 of
 the
 Messianic
 interpretation
 but
 opinions
 are
 very
 divided
 respecting
 the
 retention
 of
 the
 word
 Shiloh
 as
 a
 proper
 name
 Notwithstanding
 all
 the
 objections
 that
 are
 urged
 against
 it
 being
 so
 regarded
 we
 are
 of
 the
 opinion
 that
 it
 is
 rightly
 considered
 to
 be
 a
 proper
 name
 and
 that
 the
 English
 version
 represents
 the
 true
 sense
 of
 the
 passage
 We
 recommend
 those
 who
 wish
 to
 enter
 more
 fully
 into
 a
 question
 which
 cannot
 well
 be
 discussed
 without
 Hebrew
 criticism
 to
 the
 excellent
 notes
 upon
 Gen
 
 in
 the
 Commentary
 on
 the
 Pentateuch
 by
 Keil
 and
 Delitzsch
 Here
 the
 text
 is
 thus
 rendered
 The
 sceptre
 shall
 not
 depart
 from
 Judah
 nor
 the
 rulers
 staff
 from
 between
 his
 feet
 till
 Shiloh
 come
 and
 the
 willing
 obedience
 of
 the
 nations
 be
 to
 him
 Notwithstanding
 the
 slight
 put
 upon
 the
 Messianic
 interpretation
 by
 some
 writers
 even
 those
 from
 whom
 we
 should
 scarcely
 expect
 it
 we
 see
 this
 explanation
 confirmed
 and
 not
 weakened
 in
 the
 events
 of
 history
 The
 text
 is
 not
 taken
 to
 mean
 that
 Judah
 should
 at
 no
 time
 be
 without
 a
 royal
 ruler
 of
 his
 own
 but
 that
 the
 regal
 power
 should
 not
 finally
 cease
 from
 Judah
 until
 Shiloh
 had
 come
 The
 objections
 founded
 on
 the
 Babylonian
 captivity
 and
 similar
 intermissions
 are
 of
 no
 force
 because
 it
 is
 the
 complete
 and
 final
 termination
 which
 is
 pointed
 out
 and
 that
 only
 happened
 after
 the
 time
 of
 Christ

 Christs
 First
 Coming
 
 Nephites
 and
 LamanitesThe
 progenitors
 of
 the
 Nephite
 nation
 were
 led
 from
 Jerusalem
 
 BC
 by
 Lehi
 a
 Jewish
 prophet
 of
 the
 tribe
 of
 Manasseh
 His
 immediate
 family
 at
 the
 time
 of
 their
 departure
 from
 Jerusalem
 comprized
 his
 wife
 Sariah
 and
 their
 sons
 Laman
 Lemuel
 Sam
 and
 Nephi
 at
 a
 later
 stage
 of
 the
 history
 daughters
 are
 mentioned
 but
 whether
 any
 of
 these
 were
 born
 before
 the
 family
 exodus
 we
 are
 not
 told
 Beside
 his
 own
 family
 the
 colony
 of
 Lehi
 included
 Zoram
 and
 Ishmael
 the
 latter
 an
 Israelite
 of
 the
 tribe
 of
 Ephraim
 Ishmael
 with
 his
 family
 joined
 Lehi
 in
 the
 wilderness
 and
 his
 descendants
 were
 numbered
 with
 the
 nation
 of
 whom
 we
 are
 speaking
 The
 company
 journeyed
 somewhat
 east
 of
 south
 keeping
 near
 the
 borders
 of
 the
 Red
 Sea
 then
 changing
 their
 course
 to
 the
 eastward
 crossed
 the
 peninsula
 of
 Arabia
 and
 there
 on
 the
 shores
 of
 the
 Arabian
 Sea
 built
 and
 provisioned
 a
 vessel
 in
 which
 they
 committed
 themselves
 to
 divine
 care
 upon
 the
 waters
 Their
 voyage
 carried
 them
 eastward
 across
 the
 Indian
 Ocean
 then
 over
 the
 south
 Pacific
 Ocean
 to
 the
 western
 coast
 of
 South
 America
 whereon
 they
 landed
 
 BC
 The
 people
 established
 themselves
 on
 what
 to
 them
 was
 the
 land
 of
 promise
 many
 children
 were
 born
 and
 in
 the
 course
 of
 a
 few
 generations
 a
 numerous
 posterity
 held
 possession
 of
 the
 land
 After
 the
 death
 of
 Lehi
 a
 division
 occurred
 some
 of
 the
 people
 accepting
 as
 their
 leader
 Nephi
 who
 had
 been
 duly
 appointed
 to
 the
 prophetic
 office
 while
 the
 rest
 proclaimed
 Laman
 the
 eldest
 of
 Lehis
 sons
 as
 their
 chief
 Henceforth
 the
 divided
 people
 were
 known
 as
 Nephites
 and
 Lamanites
 respectively
 At
 times
 they
 observed
 toward
 each
 other
 fairly
 friendly
 relations
 but
 generally
 they
 were
 opposed
 the
 Lamanites
 manifesting
 implacable
 hatred
 and
 hostility
 toward
 their
 Nephite
 kindred
 The
 Nephites
 advanced
 in
 the
 arts
 of
 civilization
 built
 large
 cities
 and
 established
 prosperous
 commonwealths
 yet
 they
 often
 fell
 into
 transgression
 and
 the
 Lord
 chastened
 them
 by
 allowing
 their
 foes
 to
 become
 victorious
 They
 spread
 northward
 occupying
 the
 northern
 part
 of
 South
 America
 then
 crossing
 the
 Isthmus
 they
 extended
 their
 domain
 over
 the
 southern
 central
 and
 eastern
 portions
 of
 what
 is
 now
 the
 United
 States
 of
 America
 The
 Lamanites
 while
 increasing
 in
 numbers
 fell
 under
 the
 curse
 of
 darkness
 they
 became
 dark
 in
 skin
 and
 benighted
 in
 spirit
 forgot
 the
 God
 of

 lived
 a

 The

 gospel
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 revealed
 to
 Adam
 Faith
 in
 God
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 and
 in
 His
 Son
 the
 Savior
 of
 Adam
 and
 all
 his
 posterity
 repentance
 of
 sin
 water
 baptism
 by
 immersion
 and
 the
 reception
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 as
 a
 divine
 bestowal
 were
 proclaimed
 in
 the
 beginning
 of
 human
 history
 as
 the
 essentials
 to
 salvation
 The
 following
 scriptures
 attest
 this
 fact
 And
 thus
 the
 Gospel
 began
 to
 be
 preached
 from
 the
 beginning
 being
 declared
 by
 holy
 angels
 sent
 forth
 from
 the
 presence
 of
 God
 and
 by
 his
 own
 voice
 and
 by
 the
 gift
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 Moses
 
 The
 prophet
 Enoch
 thus
 testified
 But
 God
 hath
 made
 known
 unto
 our
 fathers
 that
 all
 men
 must
 repent
 And
 he
 called
 upon
 our
 father
 Adam
 by
 his
 own
 voice
 saying
 I
 am
 God
 I
 made
 the
 world
 and
 men
 before
 they
 were
 in
 the
 flesh
 And
 he
 also
 said
 unto
 him
 If
 thou
 wilt
 turn
 unto
 me
 and
 hearken
 unto
 my
 voice
 and
 believe
 and
 repent
 of
 all
 thy
 transgressions
 and
 be
 baptized
 even
 in
 water
 in
 the
 name
 of
 mine
 Only
 Begotten
 Son
 who
 is
 full
 of
 grace
 and
 truth
 which
 is
 Jesus
 Christ
 the
 only
 name
 which
 shall
 be
 given
 under
 heaven
 whereby
 salvation
 shall
 come
 unto
 the
 children
 of
 men
 ye
 shall
 receive
 the
 gift
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 asking
 all
 things
 in
 his
 name
 and
 whatsoever
 ye
 shall
 ask
 it
 shall
 be
 given
 you
 Moses
 
 read
 also
 
 And
 now
 behold
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 This
 is
 the
 plan
 of
 salvation
 unto
 all
 men
 through
 the
 blood
 of
 mine
 Only
 Begotten
 who
 shall
 come
 in
 the
 meridian
 of
 time
 
 And
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 when
 the
 Lord
 had
 spoken
 with
 Adam
 our
 father
 that
 Adam
 cried
 unto
 the
 Lord
 and
 he
 was
 caught
 away
 by
 the
 Spirit
 of
 the
 Lord
 and
 was
 carried
 down
 into
 the
 water
 and
 was
 laid
 under
 the
 water
 and
 was
 brought
 forth
 out
 of
 the
 water
 And
 thus
 he
 was
 baptized
 and
 the
 Spirit
 of
 God
 descended
 upon
 him
 and
 thus
 he
 was
 born
 of
 the
 Spirit
 and
 became
 quickened
 in
 the
 inner
 man
 And
 he
 heard
 a
 voice
 out
 of
 heaven
 saying

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 MERIDIAN
 OF
 TIME
 Unto
 Moses
 with
 whom
 the
 Lord
 spake
 face
 to
 face
 as
 a
 man
 speaketh
 unto
 his
 friend
 the
 course
 of
 the
 human
 race
 both
 as
 then
 past
 and
 future
 was
 made
 known
 and
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Redeemer
 was
 recognized
 by
 him
 as
 the
 event
 of
 greatest
 import
 in
 all
 the
 happenings
 to
 which
 the
 earth
 and
 its
 inhabitants
 would
 be
 witness
 The
 curse
 of
 God
 had
 aforetime
 fallen
 upon
 the
 wicked
 and
 upon
 the
 earth
 because
 of
 them
 For
 they
 would
 not
 hearken
 unto
 his
 voice
 nor
 believe
 on
 his
 Only
 Begotten
 Son
 even
 him
 whom
 he
 declared
 should
 come
 in
 the
 meridian
 of
 time
 who
 was
 prepared
 from
 before
 the
 foundation
 of
 the
 world
 In
 this
 scripture
 appears
 the
 earliest
 mention
 of
 the
 expressive
 and
 profoundly
 significant
 designation
 of
 the
 period
 in
 which
 the
 Christ
 should
 appearthe
 meridian
 of
 time
 If
 the
 expression
 be
 regarded
 as
 figurative
 be
 it
 remembered
 the
 figure
 is
 the
 Lords
 The
 term
 meridian
 as
 commonly
 used
 conveys
 the
 thought
 of
 a
 principal
 division
 of
 time
 or
 space
 thus
 we
 speak
 of
 the
 hours
 before
 the
 daily
 noon
 as
 antemeridian
 am
 and
 those
 after
 noon
 as
 postmeridian
 pm
 So
 the
 years
 and
 the
 centuries
 of
 human
 history
 are
 divided
 by
 the
 great
 event
 of
 the
 birth
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 The
 years
 preceding
 that
 epochmaking
 occurrence
 are
 now
 designated
 as
 time
 Before
 Christ
 BC
 while
 subsequent
 years
 are
 each
 specified
 as
 a
 certain
 Year
 of
 our
 Lord
 or
 as
 in
 the
 Latin
 tongue
 Anno
 Domini
 AD
 Thus
 the
 worlds
 chronology
 has
 been
 adjusted
 and
 systematized
 with
 reference
 to
 the
 time
 of
 the
 Saviors
 birth
 and
 this
 method
 of
 reckoning
 is
 in
 use
 among
 all
 Christian
 nations
 It
 is
 instructive
 to
 note
 that
 a
 similar
 system
 was
 adopted
 by
 the
 isolated
 branch
 of
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 that
 had
 been
 brought
 from
 the
 land
 of
 Palestine
 to
 the
 western
 continent
 for
 from
 the
 appearance
 of
 the
 promised
 sign
 among
 the
 people
 betokening
 the
 birth
 of
 Him
 who
 had
 been
 so
 abundantly
 predicted
 by
 their
 prophets
 the
 Nephite
 reckoning
 of
 the
 years
 starting
 with
 the
 departure
 of
 Lehi
 and
 his
 colony
 from
 Jerusalem
 was
 superseded
 by
 the
 annals
 of
 the
 new
 era
 The
 occasion
 of
 the
 Saviors
 advent
 was
 preappointed
 and
 the
 time
 thereof
 was
 specifically
 revealed
 through
 authorized
 prophets
 on
 each
 of
 the
 hemispheres
 The
 long
 history
 of
 the
 Israelitish
 nation
 had
 unfolded
 a
 succession
 of
 events
 that
 found
 a
 relative
 culmination
 in
 the
 earthly
 mission
 of
 the
 Messiah
 That
 we
 may
 the
 better
 comprehend
 the
 true
 significance
 of
 the
 Lords
 life
 and
 ministry
 while
 in
 the
 flesh
 some
 consideration
 should
 be
 given
 to
 the
 political
 social
 and
 religious
 condition
 of
 the
 people
 amongst
 whom
 He
 appeared
 and
 with
 whom
 He
 lived
 and
 died
 Such
 consideration
 involves
 at
 least
 a
 brief
 review
 of
 the
 antecedent
 history
 of
 the
 Hebrew
 nation
 The
 posterity
 of
 Abraham
 through
 Isaac
 and
 Jacob
 had
 early
 come
 to
 be
 known
 by
 the
 title
 in
 which
 they
 took
 undying
 pride
 and
 found
 inspiring
 promise
 Israelites
 or
 the
 children
 of
 Israel
 Collectively
 they
 were
 so
 designated
 throughout
 the
 dark
 days
 of
 their
 bondage
 in
 Egypt
 so
 during
 the
 four
 decades
 of
 the
 exodus
 and
 the
 return
 to
 the
 land
 of
 promise
 and
 on
 through
 the
 period
 of
 their
 prosperity
 as
 a
 mighty
 people
 under
 the
 administration
 of
 the
 judges
 and
 as
 a
 united
 monarchy
 during
 the
 successive
 reigns
 of
 Saul
 David
 and
 Solomon
 Immediately
 following
 the
 death
 of
 Solomon
 about
 
 BC
 according
 to
 the
 most
 generally
 accepted
 chronology
 the
 nation
 was
 disrupted
 by
 revolt
 The
 tribe
 of
 Judah
 part
 of
 the
 tribe
 of
 Benjamin
 and
 small
 remnants
 of
 a
 few
 other
 tribes
 remained
 true
 to
 the
 royal
 succession
 and
 accepted
 Rehoboam
 son
 of
 Solomon
 as
 their
 king
 while
 the
 rest
 usually
 spoken
 of
 as
 the
 Ten
 Tribes
 broke
 their
 allegiance
 to
 the
 house
 of
 David
 and
 made
 Jeroboam
 an
 Ephraimite
 their
 king
 The
 Ten
 Tribes
 retained
 the
 title
 Kingdom
 of
 Israel
 though
 also
 known
 as
 Ephraim
 Rehoboam
 and
 his
 adherents
 were
 distinctively
 called
 the
 Kingdom
 of
 Judah
 For
 about
 two
 hundred
 and
 fifty
 years
 the
 two
 kingdoms
 maintained
 their
 separate
 autonomy
 then
 about
 
 or
 
 BC
 the
 independent
 status
 of
 the
 Kingdom
 of
 Israel
 was
 destroyed
 and
 the
 captive
 people
 were
 transported
 to
 Assyria
 by
 Shalmanezer
 and
 others
 Subsequently
 they
 disappeared
 so
 completely
 as
 to
 be
 called
 the
 Lost
 Tribes
 The
 Kingdom
 of
 Judah
 was
 recognized
 as
 a
 nation
 for
 about
 one
 hundred
 and
 thirty
 years
 longer
 then
 about
 
 BC
 it
 was
 brought
 into
 subjection
 by
 Nebuchadnezzar
 through
 whom
 the
 Babylonian
 captivity
 was
 inaugurated
 For
 three
 score
 years
 and
 ten
 Judah
 was
 kept
 in
 exile
 and
 virtual
 bondage
 in
 consequence
 of
 their
 transgression
 as
 had
 been
 predicted
 through
 Jeremiah
 Then
 the
 Lord
 softened
 the
 hearts
 of
 their
 captors
 and
 their
 restoration
 was
 begun
 under
 the
 decree
 of
 Cyrus
 the
 Persian
 who
 had
 subdued
 the
 Babylonian
 kingdom
 The
 Hebrew
 people
 were
 permitted
 to
 return
 to
 Judea
 and
 to
 enter
 upon
 the
 work
 of
 rebuilding
 the
 temple
 at
 Jerusalem
 A
 great
 company
 of
 the
 exiled
 Hebrews
 availed
 themselves
 of
 this
 opportunity
 to
 return
 to
 the
 lands
 of
 their
 fathers
 though
 many
 elected
 to
 remain
 in
 the
 country
 of
 their
 captivity
 preferring
 Babylon
 to
 Israel
 The
 whole
 congregation
 of
 the
 Jews
 who
 returned
 from
 the
 Babylonian
 exile
 were
 but
 forty
 and
 two
 thousand
 three
 hundred
 and
 three
 score
 beside
 their
 servants
 and
 their
 maids
 of
 whom
 there
 were
 seven
 thousand
 three
 hundred
 thirty
 and
 seven
 The
 relatively
 small
 size
 of
 the
 migrating
 nation
 is
 further
 shown
 by
 the
 register
 of
 their
 beasts
 of
 burden
 While
 those
 who
 did
 return
 strove
 valiantly
 to
 reestablish
 themselves
 as
 the
 house
 of
 David
 and
 to
 regain
 some
 measure
 of
 their
 former
 prestige
 and
 glory
 the
 Jews
 were
 never
 again
 a
 truly
 independent
 people
 In
 turn
 they
 were
 preyed
 upon
 by
 Greece
 Egypt
 and
 Syria
 but
 about
 
 BC
 the
 people
 threw
 off
 in
 part
 at
 least
 the
 alien
 yoke
 as
 a
 result
 of
 the
 patriotic
 revolt
 led
 by
 the
 Maccabees
 the
 most
 prominent
 of
 whom
 was
 Judas
 Maccabeus
 The
 temple
 service
 which
 had
 been
 practically
 abolished
 through
 the
 proscription
 of
 victorious
 foes
 was
 reestablished
 In
 the
 year
 
 BC
 the
 sacred
 structure
 was
 rededicated
 and
 the
 joyful
 occasion
 was
 thereafter
 celebrated
 in
 annual
 festival
 as
 the
 Feast
 of
 Dedication
 During
 the
 reign
 of
 the
 Maccabees
 however
 the
 temple
 fell
 into
 an
 almost
 ruinous
 condition
 more
 as
 a
 result
 of
 the
 inability
 of
 the
 reduced
 and
 impoverished
 people
 to
 maintain
 it
 than
 through
 any
 further
 decline
 of
 religious
 zeal
 In
 the
 hope
 of
 insuring
 a
 greater
 measure
 of
 national
 protection
 the
 Jews
 entered
 into
 an
 unequal
 alliance
 with
 the
 Romans
 and
 eventually
 became
 tributary
 to
 them
 in
 which
 condition
 the
 Jewish
 nation
 continued
 throughout
 the
 period
 of
 our
 Lords
 ministry
 In
 the
 meridian
 of
 time
 Rome
 was
 virtually
 mistress
 of
 the
 world
 When
 Christ
 was
 born
 Augustus
 Csar
 was
 emperor
 of
 Rome
 and
 the
 Idumean
 Herod
 surnamed
 the
 Great
 was
 the
 vassal
 king
 of
 Judea
 Some
 semblance
 of
 national
 autonomy
 was
 maintained
 by
 the
 Jews
 under
 Roman
 dominion
 and
 their
 religious
 ceremonials
 were
 not
 seriously
 interfered
 with
 The
 established
 orders
 in
 the
 priesthood
 were
 recognized
 and
 the
 official
 acts
 of
 the
 national
 council
 or
 Sanhedrin
 were
 held
 to
 be
 binding
 by
 Roman
 law
 though
 the
 judicial
 powers
 of
 this
 body
 did
 not
 extend
 to
 the
 infliction
 of
 capital
 punishment
 without
 the
 sanction
 of
 the
 imperial
 executive
 It
 was
 the
 established
 policy
 of
 Rome
 to
 allow
 to
 her
 tributary
 and
 vassal
 peoples
 freedom
 in
 worship
 so
 long
 as
 the
 mythological
 deities
 dear
 to
 the
 Romans
 were
 not
 maligned
 nor
 their
 altars
 desecrated
 Needless
 to
 say
 the
 Jews
 took
 not
 kindly
 to
 alien
 domination
 though
 for
 many
 generations
 they
 had
 been
 trained
 in
 that
 experience
 their
 reduced
 status
 having
 ranged
 from
 nominal
 vassalage
 to
 servile
 bondage
 They
 were
 already
 largely
 a
 dispersed
 people
 All
 the
 Jews
 in
 Palestine
 at
 the
 time
 of
 Christs
 birth
 constituted
 but
 a
 small
 remnant
 of
 the
 great
 Davidic
 nation
 The
 Ten
 Tribes
 distinctively
 the
 aforetime
 kingdom
 of
 Israel
 had
 then
 long
 been
 lost
 to
 history
 and
 the
 people
 of
 Judah
 had
 been
 widely
 scattered
 among
 the
 nations
 In
 their
 relations
 with
 other
 peoples
 the
 Jews
 generally
 endeavored
 to
 maintain
 a
 haughty
 exclusiveness
 which
 brought
 upon
 them
 Gentile
 ridicule
 Under
 Mosaic
 law
 Israel
 had
 been
 required
 to
 keep
 apart
 from
 other
 nations
 they
 attached
 supreme
 importance
 to
 their
 Abrahamic
 lineage
 as
 children
 of
 the
 covenant
 an
 holy
 people
 unto
 the
 Lord
 whom
 He
 had
 chosen
 to
 be
 a
 special
 people
 unto
 himself
 above
 all
 people
 that
 are
 upon
 the
 face
 of
 the
 earth
 Judah
 had
 experienced
 the
 woful
 effects
 of
 dalliance
 with
 pagan
 nations
 and
 at
 the
 time
 we
 are
 now
 considering
 a
 Jew
 who
 permitted
 himself
 unnecessary
 association
 with
 a
 Gentile
 became
 an
 unclean
 being
 requiring
 ceremonial
 cleansing
 to
 free
 him
 from
 defilement
 Only
 in
 strict
 isolation
 did
 the
 leaders
 find
 hope
 of
 insuring
 the
 perpetuity
 of
 the
 nation
 It
 is
 no
 exaggeration
 to
 say
 that
 the
 Jews
 hated
 all
 other
 peoples
 and
 were
 reciprocally
 despized
 and
 contemned
 by
 all
 others
 They
 manifested
 especial
 dislike
 for
 the
 Samaritans
 perhaps
 because
 this
 people
 persisted
 in
 their
 efforts
 to
 establish
 some
 claim
 of
 racial
 relationship
 These
 Samaritans
 were
 a
 mixed
 people
 and
 were
 looked
 upon
 by
 the
 Jews
 as
 a
 mongrel
 lot
 unworthy
 of
 decent
 respect
 When
 the
 Ten
 Tribes
 were
 led
 into
 captivity
 by
 the
 king
 of
 Assyria
 foreigners
 were
 sent
 to
 populate
 Samaria
 These
 intermarried
 with
 such
 Israelites
 as
 had
 escaped
 the
 captivity
 and
 some
 modification
 of
 the
 religion
 of
 Israel
 embodying
 at
 least
 the
 profession
 of
 Jehovah
 worship
 survived
 in
 Samaria
 The
 Samaritan
 rituals
 were
 regarded
 by
 the
 Jews
 as
 unorthodox
 and
 the
 people
 as
 reprobate
 At
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 the
 enmity
 between
 Jew
 and
 Samaritan
 was
 so
 intense
 that
 travelers
 between
 Judea
 and
 Galilee
 would
 make
 long
 detours
 rather
 than
 pass
 through
 the
 province
 of
 Samaria
 which
 lay
 between
 The
 Jews
 would
 have
 no
 dealings
 with
 the
 Samaritans
 The
 proud
 feeling
 of
 selfsufficiency
 the
 obsession
 for
 exclusiveness
 and
 separationso
 distinctively
 a
 Jewish
 trait
 at
 that
 timewas
 inculcated
 at
 the
 maternal
 knee
 and
 emphasized
 in
 synagog
 and
 school
 The
 Talmud
 which
 in
 codified
 form
 postdates
 the
 time
 of
 Christs
 ministry
 enjoined
 all
 Jews
 against
 reading
 the
 books
 of
 alien
 nations
 declaring
 that
 none
 who
 so
 offended
 could
 consistently
 hope
 for
 Jehovahs
 favor
 Josephus
 gives
 his
 endorsement
 to
 similar
 injunction
 and
 records
 that
 wisdom
 among
 the
 Jews
 meant
 only
 familiarity
 with
 the
 law
 and
 ability
 to
 discourse
 thereon
 A
 thorough
 acquaintanceship
 with
 the
 law
 was
 demanded
 as
 strongly
 as
 other
 studies
 were
 discountenanced
 Thus
 the
 lines
 between
 learned
 and
 unlearned
 came
 to
 be
 rigidly
 drawn
 and
 as
 an
 inevitable
 consequence
 those
 who
 were
 accounted
 learned
 or
 so
 considered
 themselves
 looked
 down
 upon
 their
 unscholarly
 fellows
 as
 a
 class
 distinct
 and
 inferior
 Long
 before
 the
 birth
 of
 Christ
 the
 Jews
 had
 ceased
 to
 be
 a
 united
 people
 even
 in
 matters
 of
 the
 law
 though
 the
 law
 was
 their
 chief
 reliance
 as
 a
 means
 of
 maintaining
 national
 solidarity
 As
 early
 as
 four
 score
 years
 after
 the
 return
 from
 the
 Babylonian
 exile
 and
 we
 know
 not
 with
 accuracy
 how
 much
 earlier
 there
 had
 come
 to
 be
 recognized
 as
 men
 having
 authority
 certain
 scholars
 afterward
 known
 as
 scribes
 and
 honored
 as
 rabbis
 or
 teachers
 In
 the
 days
 of
 Ezra
 and
 Nehemiah
 these
 specialists
 in
 the
 law
 constituted
 a
 titled
 class
 to
 whom
 deference
 and
 honor
 were
 paid
 Ezra
 is
 designated
 the
 priest
 the
 scribe
 even
 a
 scribe
 of
 the
 words
 of
 the
 commandments
 of
 the
 Lord
 and
 of
 his
 statutes
 to
 Israel
 The
 scribes
 of
 those
 days
 did
 valuable
 service
 under
 Ezra
 and
 later
 under
 Nehemiah
 in
 compiling
 the
 sacred
 writings
 then
 extant
 and
 in
 Jewish
 usage
 those
 appointed
 as
 guardians
 and
 expounders
 of
 the
 law
 came
 to
 be
 known
 as
 members
 of
 the
 Great
 Synagog
 or
 Great
 Assembly
 concerning
 which
 we
 have
 little
 information
 through
 canonical
 channels
 According
 to
 Talmudic
 record
 the
 organization
 consisted
 of
 one
 hundred
 and
 twenty
 eminent
 scholars
 The
 scope
 of
 their
 labors
 according
 to
 the
 admonition
 traditionally
 perpetuated
 by
 themselves
 is
 thus
 expressed
 Be
 careful
 in
 judgment
 set
 up
 many
 scholars
 and
 make
 a
 hedge
 about
 the
 law
 They
 followed
 this
 behest
 by
 much
 study
 and
 careful
 consideration
 of
 all
 traditional
 details
 in
 administration
 by
 multiplying
 scribes
 and
 rabbis
 unto
 themselves
 and
 as
 some
 of
 them
 interpreted
 the
 requirement
 of
 setting
 up
 many
 scholars
 by
 writing
 many
 books
 and
 tractates
 moreover
 they
 made
 a
 fence
 or
 hedge
 about
 the
 law
 by
 adding
 numerous
 rules
 which
 prescribed
 with
 great
 exactness
 the
 officially
 established
 proprieties
 for
 every
 occasion
 Scribes
 and
 rabbis
 were
 exalted
 to
 the
 highest
 rank
 in
 the
 estimation
 of
 the
 people
 higher
 than
 that
 of
 the
 Levitical
 or
 priestly
 orders
 and
 rabbinical
 sayings
 were
 given
 precedence
 over
 the
 utterances
 of
 the
 prophets
 since
 the
 latter
 were
 regarded
 as
 but
 messengers
 or
 spokesmen
 whereas
 the
 living
 scholars
 were
 of
 themselves
 sources
 of
 wisdom
 and
 authority
 Such
 secular
 powers
 as
 Roman
 suzerainty
 permitted
 the
 Jews
 to
 retain
 were
 vested
 in
 the
 hierarchy
 whose
 members
 were
 able
 thus
 to
 gather
 unto
 themselves
 practically
 all
 official
 and
 professional
 honors
 As
 a
 natural
 result
 of
 this
 condition
 there
 was
 practically
 no
 distinction
 between
 Jewish
 civil
 and
 ecclesiastical
 law
 either
 as
 to
 the
 code
 or
 its
 administration
 Rabbinism
 comprized
 as
 an
 essential
 element
 the
 doctrine
 of
 the
 equal
 authority
 of
 oral
 rabbinical
 tradition
 with
 the
 written
 word
 of
 the
 law
 The
 aggrandizement
 implied
 in
 the
 application
 of
 the
 title
 Rabbi
 and
 the
 selfpride
 manifest
 in
 welcoming
 such
 adulation
 were
 especially
 forbidden
 by
 the
 Lord
 who
 proclaimed
 Himself
 the
 one
 Master
 and
 as
 touching
 the
 interpretation
 of
 the
 title
 held
 by
 some
 as
 father
 Jesus
 proclaimed
 but
 one
 Father
 and
 He
 in
 heaven
 But
 be
 not
 ye
 called
 Rabbi
 for
 one
 is
 your
 Master
 even
 Christ
 and
 all
 ye
 are
 brethren
 And
 call
 no
 man
 your
 father
 upon
 the
 earth
 for
 one
 is
 your
 Father
 which
 is
 in
 heaven
 Neither
 be
 ye
 called
 masters
 for
 one
 is
 your
 Master
 even
 Christ
 The
 scribes
 whether
 so
 named
 or
 designated
 by
 the
 more
 distinguishing
 appellation
 rabbis
 were
 repeatedly
 denounced
 by
 Jesus
 because
 of
 the
 dead
 literalism
 of
 their
 teachings
 and
 the
 absence
 of
 the
 spirit
 of
 righteousness
 and
 virile
 morality
 therefrom
 and
 in
 such
 denunciations
 the
 Pharisees
 are
 often
 coupled
 with
 the
 scribes
 The
 judgment
 of
 the
 Christ
 upon
 them
 is
 sufficiently
 expressed
 by
 His
 withering
 imprecation
 Woe
 unto
 you
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 hypocrites
 The
 origin
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 is
 not
 fixed
 by
 undisputed
 authority
 as
 to
 either
 time
 or
 circumstance
 though
 it
 is
 probable
 that
 the
 sect
 or
 party
 had
 a
 beginning
 in
 connection
 with
 the
 return
 of
 the
 Jews
 from
 the
 Babylonian
 captivity
 New
 ideas
 and
 added
 conceptions
 of
 the
 meaning
 of
 the
 law
 were
 promulgated
 by
 Jews
 who
 had
 imbibed
 of
 the
 spirit
 of
 Babylon
 and
 the
 resulting
 innovations
 were
 accepted
 by
 some
 and
 rejected
 by
 others
 The
 name
 Pharisee
 does
 not
 occur
 in
 the
 Old
 Testament
 nor
 in
 the
 Apocrypha
 though
 it
 is
 probable
 that
 the
 Assideans
 mentioned
 in
 the
 books
 of
 the
 Maccabees
 were
 the
 original
 Pharisees
 By
 derivation
 the
 name
 expresses
 the
 thought
 of
 separatism
 the
 Pharisee
 in
 the
 estimation
 of
 his
 class
 was
 distinctively
 set
 apart
 from
 the
 common
 people
 to
 whom
 he
 considered
 himself
 as
 truly
 superior
 as
 the
 Jews
 regarded
 themselves
 in
 contrast
 with
 other
 nations
 Pharisees
 and
 scribes
 were
 one
 in
 all
 essentials
 of
 profession
 and
 rabbinism
 was
 specifically
 their
 doctrine
 In
 the
 New
 Testament
 the
 Pharisees
 are
 often
 mentioned
 as
 in
 opposition
 to
 the
 Sadducees
 and
 such
 were
 the
 relations
 of
 the
 two
 parties
 that
 it
 becomes
 a
 simpler
 matter
 to
 contrast
 one
 with
 the
 other
 than
 to
 consider
 each
 separately
 The
 Sadducees
 came
 into
 existence
 as
 a
 reactionary
 organization
 during
 the
 second
 century
 BC
 in
 connection
 with
 an
 insurgent
 movement
 against
 the
 Maccabean
 party
 Their
 platform
 was
 that
 of
 opposition
 to
 the
 everincreasing
 mass
 of
 traditional
 lore
 with
 which
 the
 law
 was
 not
 merely
 being
 fenced
 or
 hedged
 about
 for
 safety
 but
 under
 which
 it
 was
 being
 buried
 The
 Sadducees
 stood
 for
 the
 sanctity
 of
 the
 law
 as
 written
 and
 preserved
 while
 they
 rejected
 the
 whole
 mass
 of
 rabbinical
 precept
 both
 as
 orally
 transmitted
 and
 as
 collated
 and
 codified
 in
 the
 records
 of
 the
 scribes
 The
 Pharisees
 formed
 the
 more
 popular
 party
 the
 Sadducees
 figured
 as
 the
 aristocratic
 minority
 At
 the
 time
 of
 Christs
 birth
 the
 Pharisees
 existed
 as
 an
 organized
 body
 numbering
 over
 six
 thousand
 men
 with
 Jewish
 women
 very
 generally
 on
 their
 side
 in
 sympathy
 and
 effort
 while
 the
 Sadducees
 were
 so
 small
 a
 faction
 and
 of
 such
 limited
 power
 that
 when
 they
 were
 placed
 in
 official
 positions
 they
 generally
 followed
 the
 policy
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 incumbent
 expediency
 The
 Pharisees
 were
 the
 Puritans
 of
 the
 time
 unflinching
 in
 their
 demand
 for
 compliance
 with
 the
 traditional
 rules
 as
 well
 as
 the
 original
 law
 of
 Moses
 In
 this
 connection
 note
 Pauls
 confession
 of
 faith
 and
 practise
 when
 arraigned
 before
 AgrippaThat
 after
 the
 most
 straitest
 sect
 of
 our
 religion
 I
 lived
 a
 Pharisee
 The
 Sadducees
 prided
 themselves
 on
 strict
 compliance
 with
 the
 law
 as
 they
 construed
 it
 irrespective
 of
 all
 scribes
 or
 rabbis
 The
 Sadducees
 stood
 for
 the
 temple
 and
 its
 prescribed
 ordinances
 the
 Pharisees
 for
 the
 synagog
 and
 its
 rabbinical
 teachings
 It
 is
 difficult
 to
 decide
 which
 were
 the
 more
 technical
 if
 we
 judge
 each
 party
 by
 the
 standard
 of
 its
 own
 profession
 By
 way
 of
 illustration
 the
 Sadducees
 held
 to
 the
 literal
 and
 full
 exaction
 of
 the
 Mosaic
 penaltyan
 eye
 for
 an
 eye
 and
 a
 tooth
 for
 a
 toothwhile
 the
 Pharisees
 contended
 on
 the
 authority
 of
 rabbinical
 dictum
 that
 the
 wording
 was
 figurative
 and
 that
 therefore
 the
 penalty
 could
 be
 met
 by
 a
 fine
 in
 money
 or
 goods
 Pharisees
 and
 Sadducees
 differed
 on
 many
 important
 if
 not
 fundamental
 matters
 of
 belief
 and
 practise
 including
 the
 preexistence
 of
 spirits
 the
 reality
 of
 a
 future
 state
 involving
 reward
 and
 punishment
 the
 necessity
 for
 individual
 selfdenial
 the
 immortality
 of
 the
 soul
 and
 the
 resurrection
 from
 the
 dead
 in
 each
 of
 which
 the
 Pharisees
 stood
 for
 the
 affirmative
 while
 the
 Sadducees
 denied
 Josephus
 aversthe
 doctrine
 of
 the
 Sadducees
 is
 that
 the
 soul
 and
 body
 perish
 together
 the
 law
 is
 all
 that
 they
 are
 concerned
 to
 observe
 They
 were
 a
 skeptical
 school
 of
 aristocratic
 traditionalists
 adhering
 only
 to
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 Among
 the
 many
 other
 sects
 and
 parties
 established
 on
 the
 ground
 of
 religious
 or
 political
 differences
 or
 both
 are
 the
 Essenes
 the
 Nazarites
 the
 Herodians
 and
 the
 Galileans
 The
 Essenes
 were
 characterized
 by
 professions
 of
 ultrapiety
 they
 considered
 even
 the
 strictness
 of
 Pharisaic
 profession
 as
 weak
 and
 insufficient
 they
 guarded
 membership
 in
 their
 order
 by
 severe
 exactions
 extending
 through
 a
 first
 and
 a
 second
 novitiate
 they
 were
 forbidden
 even
 to
 touch
 food
 prepared
 by
 strangers
 they
 practised
 strict
 temperance
 and
 rigid
 selfdenial
 indulged
 in
 hard
 laborpreferably
 that
 of
 agriculture
 and
 were
 forbidden
 to
 trade
 as
 merchants
 to
 take
 part
 in
 war
 or
 to
 own
 or
 employ
 slaves
 Nazarites
 are
 not
 named
 in
 the
 New
 Testament
 though
 of
 specific
 record
 in
 the
 earlier
 scriptures
 and
 from
 sources
 other
 than
 scriptural
 we
 learn
 of
 their
 existence
 at
 and
 after
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 The
 Nazarite
 was
 one
 of
 either
 sex
 who
 was
 bound
 to
 abstinence
 and
 sacrifice
 by
 a
 voluntary
 vow
 for
 special
 service
 to
 God
 the
 period
 of
 the
 vow
 might
 be
 limited
 or
 for
 life
 While
 the
 Essenes
 cultivated
 an
 ascetic
 brotherhood
 the
 Nazarites
 were
 devoted
 to
 solitary
 discipline
 The
 Herodians
 constituted
 a
 politicoreligious
 party
 who
 favored
 the
 plans
 of
 the
 Herods
 under
 the
 professed
 belief
 that
 through
 that
 dynasty
 alone
 could
 the
 status
 of
 the
 Jewish
 people
 be
 maintained
 and
 a
 reestablishment
 of
 the
 nation
 be
 secured
 We
 find
 mention
 of
 the
 Herodians
 laying
 aside
 their
 partisan
 antipathies
 and
 acting
 in
 concert
 with
 the
 Pharisees
 in
 the
 effort
 to
 convict
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 and
 bring
 Him
 to
 death
 The
 Galileans
 or
 people
 of
 Galilee
 were
 distinguished
 from
 their
 fellow
 Israelites
 of
 Judea
 by
 greater
 simplicity
 and
 less
 ostentatious
 devotion
 in
 matters
 pertaining
 to
 the
 law
 They
 were
 opposed
 to
 innovations
 yet
 were
 generally
 more
 liberal
 or
 less
 bigoted
 than
 some
 of
 the
 professedly
 devout
 Judeans
 They
 were
 prominent
 as
 able
 defenders
 in
 the
 wars
 of
 the
 people
 and
 won
 for
 themselves
 a
 reputation
 for
 bravery
 and
 patriotism
 They
 are
 mentioned
 in
 connection
 with
 certain
 tragical
 occurrences
 during
 our
 Lords
 lifetime
 The
 authority
 of
 the
 priesthood
 was
 outwardly
 acknowledged
 by
 the
 Jews
 at
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 and
 the
 appointed
 order
 of
 service
 for
 priest
 and
 Levite
 was
 duly
 observed
 During
 the
 reign
 of
 David
 the
 descendants
 of
 Aaron
 who
 were
 the
 hereditary
 priests
 in
 Israel
 had
 been
 divided
 into
 twentyfour
 courses
 and
 to
 each
 course
 the
 labors
 of
 the
 sanctuary
 were
 alloted
 in
 turn
 Representatives
 of
 but
 four
 of
 these
 courses
 returned
 from
 the
 captivity
 but
 from
 these
 the
 orders
 were
 reconstructed
 on
 the
 original
 plan
 In
 the
 days
 of
 Herod
 the
 Great
 the
 temple
 ceremonies
 were
 conducted
 with
 great
 display
 and
 outward
 elaborateness
 as
 an
 essential
 matter
 of
 consistency
 with
 the
 splendor
 of
 the
 structure
 which
 surpassed
 in
 magnificence
 all
 earlier
 sanctuaries
 Priests
 and
 Levites
 therefore
 were
 in
 demand
 for
 continuous
 service
 though
 the
 individuals
 were
 changed
 at
 short
 intervals
 according
 to
 the
 established
 system
 In
 the
 regard
 of
 the
 people
 the
 priests
 were
 inferior
 to
 the
 rabbis
 and
 the
 scholarly
 attainments
 of
 a
 scribe
 transcended
 in
 honor
 that
 pertaining
 to
 ordination
 in
 the
 priesthood
 The
 religion
 of
 the
 time
 was
 a
 matter
 of
 ceremony
 and
 formality
 of
 ritual
 and
 performance
 it
 had
 lost
 the
 very
 spirit
 of
 worship
 and
 the
 true
 conception
 of
 the
 relationship
 between
 Israel
 and
 Israels
 God
 was
 but
 a
 dream
 of
 the
 past
 Such
 in
 brief
 were
 the
 principal
 features
 of
 the
 worlds
 condition
 and
 particularly
 as
 concerns
 the
 Jewish
 people
 when
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 was
 born
 in
 the
 meridian
 of
 time
 NOTES
 TO
 CHAPTER
 
 
 The
 SanhedrinThis
 the
 chief
 court
 or
 high
 council
 of
 the
 Jews
 derives
 its
 name
 from
 the
 Greek
 sunedrion
 signifying
 a
 council
 In
 English
 it
 is
 sometimes
 though
 inaccurately
 written
 Sanhedrim
 The
 Talmud
 traces
 the
 origin
 of
 this
 body
 to
 the
 calling
 of
 the
 seventy
 elders
 whom
 Moses
 associated
 with
 himself
 making
 seventyone
 in
 all
 to
 administer
 as
 judges
 in
 Israel
 Numb
 
 
 The
 Sanhedrin
 in
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 as
 also
 long
 before
 comprized
 seventyone
 members
 including
 the
 highpriest
 who
 presided
 in
 the
 assembly
 It
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 known
 in
 its
 earlier
 period
 as
 the
 Senate
 and
 was
 occasionally
 so
 designated
 even
 after
 Christs
 death
 Josephus
 Antiquities
 xii
 
 compare
 Acts
 
 the
 name
 Sanhedrin
 came
 into
 general
 use
 during
 the
 reign
 of
 Herod
 the
 Great
 but
 the
 term
 is
 not
 of
 Biblical
 usage
 its
 equivalent
 in
 the
 New
 Testament
 is
 council
 Matt
 
 
 
 though
 it
 must
 be
 remembered
 that
 the
 same
 term
 is
 applied
 to
 courts
 of
 lesser
 jurisdiction
 than
 that
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 and
 to
 local
 tribunals
 Matt
 
 
 
 Mark
 
 see
 also
 Acts
 
 The
 following
 from
 the
 Standard
 Bible
 Dictionary
 is
 instructive
 Those
 qualified
 to
 be
 members
 were
 in
 general
 of
 the
 priestly
 house
 and
 especially
 of
 the
 Sadducean
 nobility
 But
 from
 the
 days
 of
 Queen
 Alexandra
 
 BC
 onward
 there
 were
 with
 these
 chief
 priests
 also
 many
 Pharisees
 in
 it
 under
 the
 name
 of
 scribes
 and
 elders
 These
 three
 classes
 are
 found
 combined
 in
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 
 
 
 How
 such
 members
 were
 appointed
 is
 not
 entirely
 clear
 The
 aristocratic
 character
 of
 the
 body
 and
 the
 history
 of
 its
 origin
 forbid
 the
 belief
 that
 it
 was
 by
 election
 Its
 nucleus
 probably
 consisted
 of
 the
 members
 of
 certain
 ancient
 families
 to
 which
 however
 from
 time
 to
 time
 others
 were
 added
 by
 the
 secular
 rulers
 The
 presiding
 officer
 was
 the
 high
 priest
 who
 at
 first
 exercized
 in
 it
 more
 than
 the
 authority
 of
 a
 member
 claiming
 a
 voice
 equal
 to
 that
 of
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 body
 But
 after
 the
 reduction
 of
 the
 high
 priesthood
 from
 a
 hereditary
 office
 to
 one
 bestowed
 by
 the
 political
 ruler
 according
 to
 his
 pleasure
 and
 the
 frequent
 changes
 in
 the
 office
 introduced
 by
 the
 new
 system
 the
 high
 priest
 naturally
 lost
 his
 prestige
 Instead
 of
 holding
 in
 his
 hands
 the
 government
 of
 the
 nation
 he
 came
 to
 be
 but
 one
 of
 many
 to
 share
 this
 power
 those
 who
 had
 served
 as
 high
 priests
 being
 still
 in
 esteem
 among
 their
 nation
 and
 having
 lost
 their
 office
 not
 for
 any
 reason
 that
 could
 be
 considered
 valid
 by
 the
 religious
 sense
 of
 the
 community
 exerted
 a
 large
 influence
 over
 the
 decisions
 of
 the
 assembly
 In
 the
 New
 Testament
 they
 are
 regarded
 as
 the
 rulers
 Matt
 
 
 Acts
 
 
 Luke
 
 
 John
 
 and
 Josephus
 testimony
 supports
 this
 view
 The
 functions
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 were
 religious
 and
 moral
 and
 also
 political
 In
 the
 latter
 capacity
 they
 further
 exercized
 administrative
 as
 well
 as
 judicial
 functions
 As
 a
 religious
 tribunal
 the
 Sanhedrin
 wielded
 a
 potent
 influence
 over
 the
 whole
 of
 the
 Jewish
 world
 Acts
 
 but
 as
 a
 court
 of
 justice
 after
 the
 division
 of
 the
 country
 upon
 the
 death
 of
 Herod
 its
 jurisdiction
 was
 limited
 to
 Judea
 Here
 however
 its
 power
 was
 absolute
 even
 to
 the
 passing
 of
 sentence
 of
 death
 Josephus
 Ant
 xiv
 
 
 Matt
 
 Acts
 
 
 
 although
 it
 had
 no
 authority
 to
 carry
 the
 sentence
 into
 execution
 except
 as
 approved
 and
 ordered
 by
 the
 representative
 of
 the
 Roman
 government
 The
 law
 by
 which
 the
 Sanhedrin
 governed
 was
 naturally
 the
 Jewish
 and
 in
 the
 execution
 of
 it
 this
 tribunal
 had
 a
 police
 of
 its
 own
 and
 made
 arrests
 at
 its
 discretion
 Matt
 
 While
 the
 general
 authority
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 extended
 over
 the
 whole
 of
 Judea
 the
 towns
 in
 the
 country
 had
 local
 councils
 of
 their
 own
 Matt
 
 
 Mark
 
 Josephus
 B
 J
 ii
 
 for
 the
 administration
 of
 local
 affairs
 These
 were
 constituted
 of
 elders
 Luke
 
 at
 least
 seven
 in
 number
 Josephus
 Ant
 iv
 
 B
 J
 ii
 
 and
 in
 some
 of
 the
 largest
 towns
 as
 many
 as
 twentythree
 What
 the
 relation
 of
 these
 to
 the
 central
 council
 in
 Jerusalem
 was
 does
 not
 appear
 clearly
 Some
 sort
 of
 mutual
 recognition
 existed
 among
 them
 for
 whenever
 the
 judges
 of
 the
 local
 court
 could
 not
 agree
 it
 seems
 that
 they
 were
 in
 the
 habit
 of
 referring
 their
 cases
 to
 the
 Sanhedrin
 in
 Jerusalem

 RabbisThe
 title
 Rabbi
 is
 equivalent
 to
 our
 distinctive
 appellations
 Doctor
 Master
 or
 Teacher
 By
 derivation
 it
 means
 Master
 or
 my
 Master
 thus
 connoting
 dignity
 and
 rank
 associated
 with
 politeness
 of
 address
 A
 definite
 explanation
 of
 the
 term
 is
 given
 by
 John
 
 and
 the
 same
 meaning
 attaches
 by
 implication
 to
 its
 use
 as
 recorded
 by
 Matthew
 
 It
 was
 applied
 as
 a
 title
 of
 respect
 to
 Jesus
 on
 several
 occasions
 Matt
 
 
 
 
 Mark
 
 
 
 John
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The
 title
 was
 of
 comparatively
 recent
 usage
 in
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 as
 it
 appears
 to
 have
 first
 come
 into
 general
 use
 during
 the
 reign
 of
 Herod
 the
 Great
 though
 the
 earlier
 teachers
 of
 the
 class
 without
 the
 name
 of
 Rabbis
 were
 generally
 reverenced
 and
 the
 title
 was
 carried
 back
 to
 them
 by
 later
 usage
 Rab
 was
 an
 inferior
 title
 and
 Rabban
 a
 superior
 one
 to
 Rabbi
 Rabboni
 was
 expressive
 of
 most
 profound
 respect
 love
 and
 honor
 see
 John
 
 At
 the
 time
 of
 our
 Lords
 ministry
 the
 Rabbis
 were
 held
 in
 high
 esteem
 and
 rejoiced
 in
 the
 afflations
 of
 precedence
 and
 honor
 among
 men
 They
 were
 almost
 exclusively
 of
 the
 powerful
 Pharisaic
 party
 The
 following
 is
 from
 Geikies
 Life
 and
 Words
 of
 Christ
 vol
 I
 chap
 
 If
 the
 most
 important
 figures
 in
 the
 society
 of
 Christs
 day
 were
 the
 Pharisees
 it
 was
 because
 they
 were
 the
 Rabbis
 or
 teachers
 of
 the
 Law
 As
 such
 they
 received
 superstitious
 honor
 which
 was
 indeed
 the
 great
 motive
 with
 many
 to
 court
 the
 title
 or
 join
 the
 party
 The
 Rabbis
 were
 classed
 with
 Moses
 the
 patriarchs
 and
 the
 prophets
 and
 claimed
 equal
 reverence
 Jacob
 and
 Joseph
 were
 both
 said
 to
 have
 been
 Rabbis
 The
 Targum
 of
 Jonathan
 substitutes
 Rabbis
 or
 Scribes
 for
 the
 word
 prophets
 where
 it
 occurs
 Josephus
 speaks
 of
 the
 prophets
 of
 Sauls
 day
 as
 Rabbis
 In
 the
 Jerusalem
 Targum
 all
 the
 patriarchs
 are
 learned
 Rabbis
 They
 were
 to
 be
 dearer
 to
 Israel
 than
 father
 or
 motherbecause
 parents
 avail
 only
 in
 this
 world
 as
 was
 then
 taught
 but
 the
 Rabbi
 forever
 They
 were
 set
 above
 kings
 for
 is
 it
 not
 written
 Through
 me
 kings
 reign
 Their
 entrance
 into
 a
 house
 brought
 a
 blessing
 to
 live
 or
 to
 eat
 with
 them
 was
 the
 highest
 good
 fortune
 The
 Rabbis
 went
 even
 further
 than
 this
 in
 exalting
 their
 order
 The
 Mishna
 declares
 that
 it
 is
 a
 greater
 crime
 to
 speak
 anything
 to
 their
 discredit
 than
 to
 speak
 against
 the
 words
 of
 the
 Law
 Yet
 in
 form
 the
 Law
 received
 boundless
 honor
 Every
 saying
 of
 the
 Rabbis
 had
 to
 be
 based
 on
 some
 words
 of
 it
 which
 were
 however
 explained
 in
 their
 own
 way
 The
 spirit
 of
 the
 times
 the
 wild
 fanaticism
 of
 the
 people
 and
 their
 own
 bias
 tended
 alike
 to
 make
 them
 set
 value
 only
 on
 ceremonies
 and
 worthless
 externalisms
 to
 the
 utter
 neglect
 of
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 sacred
 writings
 Still
 it
 was
 held
 that
 the
 Law
 needed
 no
 confirmation
 while
 the
 words
 of
 the
 Rabbis
 did
 So
 far
 as
 the
 Roman
 authority
 under
 which
 they
 lived
 left
 them
 free
 the
 Jews
 willingly
 put
 all
 power
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 the
 Rabbis
 They
 or
 their
 nominees
 filled
 every
 office
 from
 the
 highest
 in
 the
 priesthood
 to
 the
 lowest
 in
 the
 community
 They
 were
 the
 casuists
 the
 teachers
 the
 priests
 the
 judges
 the
 magistrates
 and
 the
 physicians
 of
 the
 nation
 The
 central
 and
 dominant
 characteristic
 of
 the
 teaching
 of
 the
 Rabbis
 was
 the
 certain
 advent
 of
 a
 great
 national
 Delivererthe
 Messiah
 or
 Anointed
 of
 God
 or
 in
 the
 Greek
 translation
 of
 the
 title
 the
 Christ
 In
 no
 other
 nation
 than
 the
 Jews
 has
 such
 a
 conception
 ever
 taken
 such
 root
 or
 shown
 such
 vitality
 It
 was
 agreed
 among
 the
 Rabbis
 that
 His
 birthplace
 must
 be
 Bethlehem
 and
 that
 He
 must
 rise
 from
 the
 tribe
 of
 Judah
 Individual
 rabbis
 gathered
 disciples
 about
 them
 and
 inevitably
 rivalry
 became
 manifest
 Rabbinical
 schools
 and
 academies
 were
 established
 each
 depending
 for
 its
 popularity
 on
 the
 greatness
 of
 some
 rabbi
 The
 most
 famous
 of
 these
 institutions
 in
 the
 time
 of
 Herod
 I
 were
 the
 school
 of
 Hillel
 and
 that
 of
 his
 rival
 Shammai
 Later
 tradition
 invested
 these
 with
 the
 title
 the
 fathers
 of
 old
 It
 appears
 from
 the
 trifling
 matters
 over
 which
 the
 followers
 of
 these
 two
 disagreed
 that
 only
 by
 opposition
 could
 either
 maintain
 a
 distinguishing
 status
 Hillel
 is
 reputed
 as
 the
 grandfather
 of
 Gamaliel
 the
 rabbi
 and
 doctor
 of
 the
 law
 at
 whose
 feet
 Saul
 of
 Tarsus
 afterward
 Paul
 the
 apostle
 received
 his
 early
 instruction
 Acts
 
 So
 far
 as
 we
 have
 historic
 record
 of
 the
 views
 principles
 or
 beliefs
 advocated
 by
 the
 rival
 schools
 of
 Hillel
 and
 Shammai
 it
 appears
 that
 the
 former
 stood
 for
 a
 greater
 degree
 of
 liberality
 and
 tolerance
 while
 the
 later
 emphasized
 a
 strict
 and
 possibly
 narrow
 interpretation
 of
 the
 law
 and
 its
 associated
 traditions
 The
 dependence
 of
 the
 rabbinical
 schools
 on
 the
 authority
 of
 tradition
 is
 illustrated
 by
 an
 incident
 of
 record
 to
 the
 effect
 that
 even
 the
 prestige
 of
 the
 great
 Hillel
 did
 not
 insure
 him
 against
 uproar
 when
 once
 he
 spoke
 without
 citing
 precedent
 only
 when
 he
 added
 that
 so
 had
 his
 masters
 Abtalion
 and
 Shemajah
 spoken
 did
 the
 tumult
 subside
 
 Sadducean
 Denial
 of
 the
 ResurrectionAs
 set
 forth
 in
 the
 text
 the
 Sadducees
 formed
 an
 association
 numerically
 small
 as
 compared
 with
 the
 more
 popular
 and
 influential
 Pharisees
 In
 the
 Gospels
 the
 Pharisees
 are
 of
 frequent
 mention
 and
 very
 commonly
 in
 connection
 with
 the
 scribes
 while
 the
 Sadducees
 are
 less
 frequently
 named
 In
 the
 Acts
 of
 the
 Apostles
 the
 Sadducees
 appear
 frequently
 as
 opponents
 of
 the
 Church
 This
 condition
 was
 doubtless
 due
 to
 the
 prominence
 given
 the
 resurrection
 from
 the
 dead
 among
 the
 themes
 of
 the
 apostolic
 preaching
 the
 Twelve
 continually
 bearing
 testimony
 to
 the
 actual
 resurrection
 of
 Christ
 Sadducean
 doctrine
 denied
 the
 actuality
 and
 possibility
 of
 a
 bodily
 resurrection
 the
 contention
 resting
 mainly
 on
 the
 ground
 that
 Moses
 who
 was
 regarded
 as
 the
 supreme
 mortal
 lawgiver
 in
 Israel
 and
 the
 chief
 mouthpiece
 of
 Jehovah
 had
 written
 nothing
 concerning
 life
 after
 death
 The
 following
 is
 taken
 from
 Smiths
 Dictionary
 of
 the
 Bible
 article
 Sadducees
 as
 touching
 this
 matter
 The
 denial
 of
 mans
 resurrection
 after
 death
 followed
 in
 the
 conception
 of
 the
 Sadducees
 as
 a
 logical
 conclusion
 from
 their
 denial
 that
 Moses
 had
 revealed
 to
 the
 Israelites
 the
 Oral
 Law
 For
 on
 a
 point
 so
 momentous
 as
 a
 second
 life
 beyond
 the
 grave
 no
 religious
 party
 among
 the
 Jews
 would
 have
 deemed
 themselves
 bound
 to
 accept
 any
 doctrine
 as
 an
 article
 of
 faith
 unless
 it
 had
 been
 proclaimed
 by
 Moses
 their
 great
 legislator
 and
 it
 is
 certain
 that
 in
 the
 written
 Law
 of
 the
 Pentateuch
 there
 is
 a
 total
 absence
 of
 any
 assertion
 by
 Moses
 of
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 dead
 This
 fact
 is
 presented
 to
 Christians
 in
 a
 striking
 manner
 by
 the
 wellknown
 words
 of
 the
 Pentateuch
 which
 are
 quoted
 by
 Christ
 in
 argument
 with
 the
 Sadducees
 on
 this
 subject
 Exo
 
 
 Mark
 
 
 Matt
 
 
 Luke
 
 It
 cannot
 be
 doubted
 that
 in
 such
 a
 case
 Christ
 would
 quote
 to
 His
 powerful
 adversaries
 the
 most
 cogent
 text
 in
 the
 Law
 and
 yet
 the
 text
 actually
 quoted
 does
 not
 do
 more
 than
 suggest
 an
 inference
 on
 this
 great
 doctrine
 It
 is
 true
 that
 passages
 in
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 Old
 Testament
 express
 a
 belief
 in
 the
 resurrection
 Isa
 
 Dan
 
 Job
 
 and
 in
 some
 of
 the
 Psalms
 and
 it
 may
 at
 first
 sight
 be
 a
 subject
 of
 surprize
 that
 the
 Sadducees
 were
 not
 convinced
 by
 the
 authority
 of
 those
 passages
 But
 although
 the
 Sadducees
 regarded
 the
 books
 which
 contained
 these
 passages
 as
 sacred
 it
 is
 more
 than
 doubtful
 whether
 any
 of
 the
 Jews
 regarded
 them
 as
 sacred
 in
 precisely
 the
 same
 sense
 as
 the
 written
 Law
 To
 the
 Jews
 Moses
 was
 and
 is
 a
 colossal
 form
 preeminent
 in
 authority
 above
 all
 subsequent
 prophets
 
 The
 Temple
 of
 HerodHerods
 purpose
 in
 the
 great
 undertaking
 that
 of
 restoring
 the
 temple
 and
 of
 enlarging
 it
 on
 a
 plan
 of
 unprecedented
 magnificence
 was
 that
 of
 aggrandizing
 himself
 and
 the
 nation
 rather
 than
 the
 rendering
 of
 homage
 to
 Jehovah
 His
 proposition
 to
 rebuild
 or
 restore
 the
 temple
 on
 a
 scale
 of
 increased
 magnificence
 was
 regarded
 with
 suspicion
 and
 received
 with
 disfavor
 by
 the
 Jews
 who
 feared
 that
 were
 the
 ancient
 edifice
 demolished
 the
 arbitrary
 monarch
 might
 abandon
 his
 plan
 and
 the
 people
 would
 be
 left
 without
 a
 temple
 To
 allay
 these
 fears
 the
 king
 proceeded
 to
 reconstruct
 and
 restore
 the
 old
 edifice
 part
 by
 part
 directing
 the
 work
 so
 that
 at
 no
 time
 was
 the
 temple
 service
 seriously
 interrupted
 So
 little
 of
 the
 ancient
 structure
 was
 allowed
 to
 stand
 however
 that
 the
 temple
 of
 Herod
 must
 be
 regarded
 as
 a
 new
 creation
 The
 work
 was
 begun
 about
 sixteen
 years
 before
 the
 birth
 of
 Christ
 and
 while
 the
 Holy
 House
 itself
 was
 practically
 completed
 within
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 this
 part
 of
 the
 labor
 having
 been
 performed
 by
 a
 body
 of
 one
 thousand
 priests
 specially
 trained
 for
 the
 purpose
 the
 temple
 area
 was
 a
 scene
 of
 uninterrupted
 building
 operations
 down
 to
 the
 year
 
 AD
 We
 read
 that
 in
 the
 time
 of
 Christs
 ministry
 the
 temple
 had
 been
 fortysix
 years
 in
 building
 and
 at
 that
 time
 it
 was
 unfinished
 The
 Biblical
 record
 gives
 us
 little
 information
 regarding
 this
 the
 last
 and
 the
 greatest
 of
 ancient
 temples
 for
 what
 we
 know
 concerning
 it
 we
 are
 indebted
 mainly
 to
 Josephus
 with
 some
 corroborative
 testimony
 found
 in
 the
 Talmud
 In
 all
 essentials
 the
 Holy
 House
 or
 Temple
 proper
 was
 similar
 to
 the
 two
 earlier
 houses
 of
 sanctuary
 though
 externally
 far
 more
 elaborate
 and
 imposing
 than
 either
 but
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 surrounding
 courts
 and
 associated
 buildings
 the
 Temple
 of
 Herod
 preeminently
 excelled
 Yet
 its
 beauty
 and
 grandeur
 lay
 in
 architectural
 excellence
 rather
 than
 in
 the
 sanctity
 of
 its
 worship
 or
 in
 the
 manifestation
 of
 the
 Divine
 Presence
 within
 its
 walls
 Its
 ritual
 and
 service
 were
 largely
 manprescribed
 for
 while
 the
 letter
 of
 the
 Mosaic
 Law
 was
 professedly
 observed
 the
 law
 had
 been
 supplemented
 and
 in
 many
 features
 supplanted
 by
 rule
 and
 priestly
 prescription
 The
 Jews
 professed
 to
 consider
 it
 holy
 and
 by
 them
 it
 was
 proclaimed
 as
 the
 House
 of
 the
 Lord
 Devoid
 though
 it
 was
 of
 the
 divine
 accompaniments
 of
 earlier
 shrines
 accepted
 of
 God
 and
 defiled
 as
 it
 was
 by
 priestly
 arrogance
 and
 usurpation
 as
 also
 by
 the
 selfish
 interest
 of
 traffic
 and
 trade
 it
 was
 nevertheless
 recognized
 even
 by
 our
 Lord
 the
 Christ
 as
 His
 Fathers
 House
 Matt
 
 compare
 Mark
 
 Luke
 
 For
 thirty
 or
 more
 years
 after
 the
 death
 of
 Christ
 the
 Jews
 continued
 the
 work
 of
 adding
 to
 and
 embellishing
 the
 temple
 buildings
 The
 elaborate
 design
 conceived
 and
 projected
 by
 Herod
 had
 been
 practically
 completed
 the
 temple
 was
 wellnigh
 finished
 and
 as
 soon
 afterward
 appeared
 was
 ready
 for
 destruction
 Its
 fate
 had
 been
 definitely
 foretold
 by
 the
 Savior
 HimselfFrom

 State

 the
 World
 at
 the
 Time
 of
 the
 Saviors
 BirthAt
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 Christian
 era
 the
 Jews
 in
 common
 with
 most
 other
 nations
 were
 subjects
 of
 the
 Roman
 empire
 They
 were
 allowed
 a
 considerable
 degree
 of
 liberty
 in
 maintaining
 their
 religious
 observances
 and
 national
 customs
 generally
 but
 their
 status
 was
 far
 from
 that
 of
 a
 free
 and
 independent
 people
 The
 period
 was
 one
 of
 comparative
 peacea
 time
 marked
 by
 fewer
 wars
 and
 less
 dissension
 than
 the
 empire
 had
 known
 for
 many
 years
 These
 conditions
 were
 favorable
 for
 the
 mission
 of
 the
 Christ
 and
 for
 the
 founding
 of
 His
 Church
 on
 earth
 The
 religious
 systems
 extant
 at
 the
 time
 of
 Christs
 earthly
 ministry
 may
 be
 classified
 in
 a
 general
 way
 as
 Jewish
 and
 Pagan
 with
 a
 minor
 systemthe
 Samaritanwhich
 was
 essentially
 a
 mixture
 of
 the
 other
 two
 The
 children
 of
 Israel
 alone
 proclaimed
 the
 existence
 of
 the
 true
 and
 living
 God
 they
 alone
 looked
 forward
 to
 the
 advent
 of
 the
 Messiah
 whom
 mistakenly
 they
 awaited
 as
 a
 prospective
 conqueror
 coming
 to
 crush
 the
 enemies
 of
 their
 nation
 All
 other
 nations
 tongues
 and
 peoples
 bowed
 to
 pagan
 deities
 and
 their
 worship
 comprized
 nought
 but
 the
 sensual
 rites
 of
 heathen
 idolatry
 Paganism
 was
 a
 religion
 of
 form
 and
 ceremony
 based
 on
 polytheisma
 belief
 in
 the
 existence
 of
 a
 multitude
 of
 gods
 which
 deities
 were
 subject
 to
 all
 the
 vices
 and
 passions
 of
 humanity
 while
 distinguished
 by
 immunity
 from
 death
 Morality
 and
 virtue
 were
 unknown
 as
 elements
 of
 heathen
 service
 and
 the
 dominant
 idea
 in
 pagan
 worship
 was
 that
 of
 propitiating
 the
 gods
 in
 the
 hope
 of

 CHAPTER
 
 GABRIELS
 ANNUNCIATION
 OF
 JOHN
 AND
 OF
 JESUS
 JOHN
 THE
 FORERUNNER
 Associated
 with
 the
 prophecies
 of
 the
 birth
 of
 Christ
 are
 predictions
 concerning
 one
 who
 should
 precede
 Him
 going
 before
 to
 prepare
 the
 way
 It
 is
 not
 surprizing
 that
 the
 annunciation
 of
 the
 immediate
 advent
 of
 the
 forerunner
 was
 speedily
 followed
 by
 that
 of
 the
 Messiah
 nor
 that
 the
 proclamations
 were
 made
 by
 the
 same
 heavenly
 embassadorGabriel
 sent
 from
 the
 presence
 of
 God
 About
 fifteen
 months
 prior
 to
 the
 Saviors
 birth
 Zacharias
 a
 priest
 of
 the
 Aaronic
 order
 was
 officiating
 in
 the
 functions
 of
 his
 office
 in
 the
 temple
 at
 Jerusalem
 His
 wife
 Elisabeth
 was
 also
 of
 a
 priestly
 family
 being
 numbered
 among
 the
 descendants
 of
 Aaron
 The
 couple
 had
 never
 been
 blessed
 with
 children
 and
 at
 the
 time
 of
 which
 we
 speak
 they
 were
 both
 well
 stricken
 in
 years
 and
 had
 sorrowfully
 given
 up
 hope
 of
 posterity
 Zacharias
 belonged
 to
 the
 course
 of
 priests
 named
 after
 Abijah
 and
 known
 in
 later
 time
 as
 the
 course
 of
 Abia
 This
 was
 the
 eighth
 in
 the
 order
 of
 the
 twentyfour
 courses
 established
 by
 David
 the
 king
 each
 course
 being
 appointed
 to
 serve
 in
 turn
 a
 week
 at
 the
 sanctuary
 It
 will
 be
 remembered
 that
 on
 the
 return
 of
 the
 people
 from
 Babylon
 only
 four
 of
 the
 courses
 were
 represented
 but
 of
 these
 four
 each
 averaged
 over
 fourteen
 hundred
 men
 During
 his
 week
 of
 service
 each
 priest
 was
 required
 to
 maintain
 scrupulously
 a
 state
 of
 ceremonial
 cleanliness
 of
 person
 he
 had
 to
 abstain
 from
 wine
 and
 from
 food
 except
 that
 specifically
 prescribed
 he
 had
 to
 bathe
 frequently
 he
 lived
 within
 the
 temple
 precincts
 and
 thus
 was
 cut
 off
 from
 family
 association
 he
 was
 not
 allowed
 to
 come
 near
 the
 dead
 nor
 to
 mourn
 in
 the
 formal
 manner
 if
 death
 should
 rob
 him
 of
 even
 his
 nearest
 and
 dearest
 of
 kin
 We
 learn
 that
 the
 daily
 selection
 of
 the
 priest
 who
 should
 enter
 the
 Holy
 Place
 and
 there
 burn
 incense
 on
 the
 golden
 altar
 was
 determined
 by
 lot
 and
 furthermore
 we
 gather
 from
 nonscriptural
 history
 that
 because
 of
 the
 great
 number
 of
 priests
 the
 honor
 of
 so
 officiating
 seldom
 fell
 twice
 to
 the
 same
 person
 On
 this
 day
 the
 lot
 had
 fallen
 to
 Zacharias
 It
 was
 a
 very
 solemn
 occasion
 in
 the
 life
 of
 the
 humble
 Judean
 priestthis
 one
 day
 in
 his
 life
 on
 which
 the
 special
 and
 particularly
 sacred
 service
 was
 required
 of
 him
 Within
 the
 Holy
 Place
 he
 was
 separated
 by
 the
 veil
 of
 the
 temple
 only
 from
 the
 Oracle
 or
 Holy
 of
 Holiesthe
 inner
 sanctuary
 into
 which
 none
 but
 the
 high
 priest
 might
 enter
 and
 he
 only
 on
 the
 Day
 of
 Atonement
 after
 long
 ceremonial
 preparation
 The
 place
 and
 the
 time
 were
 conducive
 to
 the
 highest
 and
 most
 reverential
 feelings
 As
 Zacharias
 ministered
 within
 the
 Holy
 Place
 the
 people
 without
 bowed
 themselves
 in
 prayer
 watching
 for
 the
 clouds
 of
 incense
 smoke
 to
 appear
 above
 the
 great
 partition
 which
 formed
 the
 barrier
 between
 the
 place
 of
 general
 assembly
 and
 the
 Holy
 Place
 and
 awaiting
 the
 reappearance
 of
 the
 priest
 and
 his
 pronouncement
 of
 the
 benediction
 Before
 the
 astonished
 gaze
 of
 Zacharias
 at
 this
 supreme
 moment
 of
 his
 priestly
 service
 there
 appeared
 standing
 on
 the
 right
 of
 the
 golden
 altar
 of
 incense
 an
 angel
 of
 the
 Lord
 Many
 generations
 had
 passed
 in
 Jewry
 since
 any
 visible
 presence
 other
 than
 mortal
 had
 been
 manifest
 within
 the
 temple
 either
 in
 the
 Holy
 Place
 or
 the
 Holy
 of
 Holies
 the
 people
 regarded
 personal
 visitations
 of
 heavenly
 beings
 as
 occurrences
 of
 the
 past
 they
 had
 come
 almost
 to
 believe
 that
 there
 were
 no
 longer
 prophets
 in
 Israel
 Nevertheless
 there
 was
 always
 a
 feeling
 of
 anxiety
 akin
 to
 that
 of
 troubled
 expectancy
 whenever
 a
 priest
 approached
 the
 inner
 sanctuary
 which
 was
 regarded
 as
 the
 particular
 abode
 of
 Jehovah
 should
 He
 ever
 again
 condescend
 to
 visit
 His
 people
 In
 view
 of
 these
 conditions
 we
 read
 without
 surprize
 that
 this
 angelic
 presence
 troubled
 Zacharias
 and
 caused
 fear
 to
 fall
 upon
 him
 The
 words
 of
 the
 heavenly
 visitant
 however
 were
 comforting
 though
 of
 startling
 import
 embodying
 as
 they
 did
 the
 unqualified
 assurance
 that
 the
 mans
 prayers
 had
 been
 heard
 and
 that
 his
 wife
 should
 bear
 him
 a
 son
 who
 must
 be
 named
 John
 The
 promise
 went
 even
 further
 specifying
 that
 the
 child
 to
 be
 born
 of
 Elisabeth
 would
 be
 a
 blessing
 to
 the
 people
 many
 would
 rejoice
 at
 his
 birth
 he
 would
 be
 great
 in
 the
 sight
 of
 the
 Lord
 and
 must
 be
 guarded
 against
 wine
 and
 strong
 drink
 he
 would
 be
 filled
 with
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 would
 be
 the
 means
 of
 turning
 many
 souls
 to
 God
 and
 would
 go
 before
 to
 make
 ready
 a
 people
 prepared
 to
 receive
 the
 Messiah
 Doubtless
 Zacharias
 recognised
 in
 the
 predicted
 future
 of
 the
 yet
 unborn
 child
 the
 great
 forerunner
 of
 whom
 the
 prophets
 had
 told
 and
 the
 psalmist
 had
 sung
 but
 that
 such
 a
 one
 should
 be
 offspring
 of
 himself
 and
 his
 aged
 wife
 seemed
 impossible
 despite
 the
 angels
 promise
 The
 man
 doubted
 and
 asked
 whereby
 he
 should
 know
 that
 what
 his
 visitant
 had
 spoken
 was
 true
 And
 the
 angel
 answering
 said
 unto
 him
 I
 am
 Gabriel
 that
 stand
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 God
 and
 am
 sent
 to
 speak
 unto
 thee
 and
 to
 show
 thee
 these
 glad
 tidings
 And
 behold
 thou
 shalt
 be
 dumb
 and
 not
 able
 to
 speak
 until
 the
 day
 that
 these
 things
 shall
 be
 performed
 because
 thou
 believest
 not
 my
 words
 which
 shall
 be
 fulfilled
 in
 their
 season
 When
 the
 highly
 blessed
 though
 sorely
 smitten
 priest
 at
 length
 came
 from
 within
 and
 appeared
 before
 the
 expectant
 congregation
 already
 made
 anxious
 by
 his
 delayed
 return
 he
 could
 but
 mutely
 dismiss
 the
 assembly
 and
 by
 signs
 indicate
 that
 he
 had
 seen
 a
 vision
 The
 penalty
 for
 doubt
 was
 already
 operative
 Zacharias
 was
 dumb
 In
 due
 time
 the
 child
 was
 born
 there
 in
 the
 hill
 country
 of
 Judea
 where
 Zacharias
 and
 Elisabeth
 had
 their
 home
 and
 on
 the
 eighth
 day
 following
 the
 birth
 the
 family
 assembled
 in
 accordance
 with
 custom
 and
 Mosaic
 requirement
 to
 name
 the
 babe
 in
 connection
 with
 the
 rite
 of
 circumcision
 All
 suggestions
 that
 he
 be
 called
 after
 his
 father
 were
 overruled
 by
 Zacharias
 who
 wrote
 with
 decisive
 finality
 His
 name
 is
 John
 Thereupon
 the
 dumb
 priests
 tongue
 was
 loosed
 and
 being
 filled
 with
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 he
 burst
 forth
 in
 prophecy
 praise
 and
 song
 his
 inspired
 utterances
 have
 been
 set
 to
 music
 and
 are
 sung
 in
 worship
 by
 many
 Christian
 congregations
 as
 the
 Benedictus
 Blessed
 be
 the
 Lord
 God
 of
 Israel
 for
 he
 hath
 visited
 and
 redeemed
 his
 people
 and
 hath
 raised
 up
 an
 horn
 of
 salvation
 for
 us
 in
 the
 house
 of
 his
 servant
 David
 as
 he
 spake
 by
 the
 mouth
 of
 his
 holy
 prophets
 which
 have
 been
 since
 the
 world
 began
 that
 we
 should
 be
 saved
 from
 our
 enemies
 and
 from
 the
 hand
 of
 all
 that
 hate
 us
 to
 perform
 the
 mercy
 promised
 to
 our
 fathers
 and
 to
 remember
 his
 holy
 covenant
 the
 oath
 which
 he
 sware
 to
 our
 father
 Abraham
 that
 he
 would
 grant
 unto
 us
 that
 we
 being
 delivered
 out
 of
 the
 hand
 of
 our
 enemies
 might
 serve
 him
 without
 fear
 in
 holiness
 and
 righteousness
 before
 him
 all
 the
 days
 of
 our
 life
 And
 thou
 child
 shalt
 be
 called
 the
 prophet
 of
 the
 Highest
 for
 thou
 shalt
 go
 before
 the
 face
 of
 the
 Lord
 to
 prepare
 his
 ways
 to
 give
 knowledge
 of
 salvation
 unto
 his
 people
 by
 the
 remission
 of
 their
 sins
 through
 the
 tender
 mercy
 of
 our
 God
 whereby
 the
 dayspring
 from
 on
 high
 hath
 visited
 us
 to
 give
 light
 to
 them
 that
 sit
 in
 darkness
 and
 in
 the
 shadow
 of
 death
 to
 guide
 our
 feet
 into
 the
 way
 of
 peace
 The
 last
 words
 Zacharias
 had
 uttered
 prior
 to
 the
 infliction
 of
 dumbness
 were
 words
 of
 doubt
 and
 unbelief
 words
 in
 which
 he
 had
 called
 for
 a
 sign
 as
 proof
 of
 authority
 of
 one
 who
 came
 from
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 Almighty
 the
 words
 with
 which
 he
 broke
 his
 long
 silence
 were
 words
 of
 praise
 unto
 God
 in
 whom
 he
 had
 all
 assurance
 words
 that
 were
 as
 a
 sign
 to
 all
 who
 heard
 and
 the
 fame
 whereof
 spread
 throughout
 the
 region
 The
 unusual
 circumstances
 attending
 the
 birth
 of
 John
 notably
 the
 months
 of
 dumbness
 passed
 by
 the
 father
 and
 his
 sudden
 recovery
 of
 speech
 on
 the
 bestowal
 of
 the
 foreappointed
 name
 caused
 many
 to
 marvel
 and
 some
 to
 fear
 as
 they
 asked
 What
 manner
 of
 child
 shall
 this
 be
 When
 a
 man
 grown
 John
 raised
 his
 voice
 in
 the
 wilderness
 again
 in
 fulfillment
 of
 prophecy
 the
 people
 questioned
 as
 to
 whether
 he
 was
 not
 the
 Messiah
 Of
 his
 life
 between
 infancy
 and
 the
 beginning
 of
 his
 public
 ministry
 a
 period
 of
 approximately
 thirty
 years
 we
 have
 of
 record
 but
 a
 single
 sentence
 And
 the
 child
 grew
 and
 waxed
 strong
 in
 spirit
 and
 was
 in
 the
 deserts
 till
 the
 day
 of
 his
 shewing
 unto
 Israel
 THE
 ANNUNCIATION
 TO
 THE
 VIRGIN
 Six
 months
 after
 the
 visitation
 of
 Gabriel
 to
 Zacharias
 and
 three
 months
 prior
 to
 the
 birth
 of
 John
 the
 same
 heavenly
 messenger
 was
 sent
 to
 a
 young
 woman
 named
 Mary
 who
 lived
 at
 Nazareth
 a
 town
 in
 Galilee
 She
 was
 of
 the
 lineage
 of
 David
 and
 though
 unmarried
 was
 betrothed
 or
 espoused
 to
 a
 man
 named
 Joseph
 who
 also
 was
 of
 royal
 descent
 through
 the
 Davidic
 line
 The
 angels
 salutation
 while
 full
 of
 honor
 and
 blessing
 caused
 Mary
 to
 wonder
 and
 to
 feel
 troubled
 Hail
 thou
 that
 art
 highly
 favoured
 the
 Lord
 is
 with
 thee
 blessed
 art
 thou
 among
 women
 thus
 did
 Gabriel
 greet
 the
 virgin
 In
 common
 with
 other
 daughters
 of
 Israel
 specifically
 those
 of
 the
 tribe
 of
 Judah
 and
 of
 known
 descent
 from
 David
 Mary
 had
 doubtless
 contemplated
 with
 holy
 joy
 and
 ecstasy
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Messiah
 through
 the
 royal
 line
 she
 knew
 that
 some
 Jewish
 maiden
 was
 yet
 to
 become
 the
 mother
 of
 the
 Christ
 Was
 it
 possible
 that
 the
 angels
 words
 to
 her
 had
 reference
 to
 this
 supreme
 expectation
 and
 hope
 of
 the
 nation
 She
 had
 little
 time
 to
 turn
 these
 things
 in
 her
 mind
 for
 the
 angel
 continued
 Fear
 not
 Mary
 for
 thou
 hast
 found
 favour
 with
 God
 And
 behold
 thou
 shalt
 conceive
 in
 thy
 womb
 and
 bring
 forth
 a
 son
 and
 shalt
 call
 his
 name
 JESUS
 He
 shall
 be
 great
 and
 shall
 be
 called
 the
 Son
 of
 the
 Highest
 and
 the
 Lord
 God
 shall
 give
 unto
 him
 the
 throne
 of
 his
 father
 David
 and
 he
 shall
 reign
 over
 the
 house
 of
 Jacob
 for
 ever
 and
 of
 his
 kingdom
 there
 shall
 be
 no
 end
 Even
 yet
 she
 comprehended
 but
 in
 part
 the
 import
 of
 this
 momentous
 visitation
 Not
 in
 the
 spirit
 of
 doubt
 such
 as
 had
 prompted
 Zacharias
 to
 ask
 for
 a
 sign
 but
 through
 an
 earnest
 desire
 for
 information
 and
 explanation
 Mary
 conscious
 of
 her
 unmarried
 status
 and
 sure
 of
 her
 virgin
 condition
 asked
 How
 shall
 this
 be
 seeing
 I
 know
 not
 a
 man
 The
 answer
 to
 her
 natural
 and
 simple
 inquiry
 was
 the
 announcement
 of
 a
 miracle
 such
 as
 the
 world
 had
 never
 knownnot
 a
 miracle
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 a
 happening
 contrary
 to
 natures
 law
 nevertheless
 a
 miracle
 through
 the
 operation
 of
 higher
 law
 such
 as
 the
 human
 mind
 ordinarily
 fails
 to
 comprehend
 or
 regard
 as
 possible
 Mary
 was
 informed
 that
 she
 would
 conceive
 and
 in
 time
 bring
 forth
 a
 Son
 of
 whom
 no
 mortal
 man
 would
 be
 the
 fatherAnd
 the
 angel
 answered
 and
 said
 unto
 her
 The
 Holy
 Ghost
 shall
 come
 upon
 thee
 and
 the
 power
 of
 the
 Highest
 shall
 overshadow
 thee
 therefore
 also
 that
 holy
 thing
 which
 shall
 be
 born
 of
 thee
 shall
 be
 called
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 Then
 the
 angel
 told
 her
 of
 the
 blessed
 condition
 of
 her
 cousin
 Elisabeth
 who
 had
 been
 barren
 and
 by
 way
 of
 sufficient
 and
 final
 explanation
 added
 For
 with
 God
 nothing
 shall
 be
 impossible
 With
 gentle
 submissiveness
 and
 humble
 acceptance
 the
 pure
 young
 virgin
 replied
 Behold
 the
 handmaid
 of
 the
 Lord
 be
 it
 unto
 me
 according
 to
 thy
 word
 His
 message
 delivered
 Gabriel
 departed
 leaving
 the
 chosen
 Virgin
 of
 Nazareth
 to
 ponder
 over
 her
 wondrous
 experience
 Marys
 promised
 Son
 was
 to
 be
 The
 Only
 Begotten
 of
 the
 Father
 in
 the
 flesh
 so
 it
 had
 been
 both
 positively
 and
 abundantly
 predicted
 True
 the
 event
 was
 unprecedented
 true
 also
 it
 has
 never
 been
 paralleled
 but
 that
 the
 virgin
 birth
 would
 be
 unique
 was
 as
 truly
 essential
 to
 the
 fulfilment
 of
 prophecy
 as
 that
 it
 should
 occur
 at
 all
 That
 Child
 to
 be
 born
 of
 Mary
 was
 begotten
 of
 Elohim
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 not
 in
 violation
 of
 natural
 law
 but
 in
 accordance
 with
 a
 higher
 manifestation
 thereof
 and
 the
 offspring
 from
 that
 association
 of
 supreme
 sanctity
 celestial
 Sireship
 and
 pure
 though
 mortal
 maternity
 was
 of
 right
 to
 be
 called
 the
 Son
 of
 the
 Highest
 In
 His
 nature
 would
 be
 combined
 the
 powers
 of
 Godhood
 with
 the
 capacity
 and
 possibilities
 of
 mortality
 and
 this
 through
 the
 ordinary
 operation
 of
 the
 fundamental
 law
 of
 heredity
 declared
 of
 God
 demonstrated
 by
 science
 and
 admitted
 by
 philosophy
 that
 living
 beings
 shall
 propagateafter
 their
 kind
 The
 Child
 Jesus
 was
 to
 inherit
 the
 physical
 mental
 and
 spiritual
 traits
 tendencies
 and
 powers
 that
 characterized
 His
 parentsone
 immortal
 and
 glorifiedGod
 the
 other
 humanwoman
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 to
 be
 born
 of
 mortal
 woman
 but
 was
 not
 directly
 the
 offspring
 of
 mortal
 man
 except
 so
 far
 as
 His
 mother
 was
 the
 daughter
 of
 both
 man
 and
 woman
 In
 our
 Lord
 alone
 has
 been
 fulfilled
 the
 word
 of
 God
 spoken
 in
 relation
 to
 the
 fall
 of
 Adam
 that
 the
 seed
 of
 the
 woman
 should
 have
 power
 to
 overcome
 Satan
 by
 bruising
 the
 serpents
 head
 In
 respect
 to
 place
 condition
 and
 general
 environment
 Gabriels
 annunciation
 to
 Zacharias
 offers
 strong
 contrast
 to
 the
 delivery
 of
 his
 message
 to
 Mary
 The
 prospective
 forerunner
 of
 the
 Lord
 was
 announced
 to
 his
 father
 within
 the
 magnificent
 temple
 and
 in
 a
 place
 the
 most
 exclusively
 sacred
 save
 one
 other
 in
 the
 Holy
 House
 under
 the
 light
 shed
 from
 the
 golden
 candlestick
 and
 further
 illumined
 by
 the
 glow
 of
 living
 coals
 on
 the
 altar
 of
 gold
 the
 Messiah
 was
 announced
 to
 His
 mother
 in
 a
 small
 town
 far
 from
 the
 capital
 and
 the
 temple
 most
 probably
 within
 the
 walls
 of
 a
 simple
 Galilean
 cottage
 MARYS
 VISIT
 TO
 HER
 COUSIN
 ELISABETH
 It
 was
 natural
 that
 Mary
 left
 now
 to
 herself
 with
 a
 secret
 in
 her
 soul
 holier
 greater
 and
 more
 thrilling
 than
 any
 ever
 borne
 before
 or
 since
 should
 seek
 companionship
 and
 that
 of
 some
 one
 of
 her
 own
 sex
 in
 whom
 she
 could
 confide
 from
 whom
 she
 might
 hope
 to
 derive
 comfort
 and
 support
 and
 to
 whom
 it
 would
 be
 not
 wrong
 to
 tell
 what
 at
 that
 time
 was
 probably
 known
 to
 no
 mortal
 save
 herself
 Her
 heavenly
 visitant
 had
 indeed
 suggested
 all
 this
 in
 his
 mention
 of
 Elisabeth
 Marys
 cousin
 herself
 a
 subject
 of
 unusual
 blessing
 and
 a
 woman
 through
 whom
 another
 miracle
 of
 God
 had
 been
 wrought
 Mary
 set
 out
 with
 haste
 from
 Nazareth
 for
 the
 hill
 country
 of
 Judea
 on
 a
 journey
 of
 about
 a
 hundred
 miles
 if
 the
 traditional
 account
 be
 true
 that
 the
 little
 town
 of
 Juttah
 was
 the
 home
 of
 Zacharias
 There
 was
 mutual
 joy
 in
 the
 meeting
 between
 Mary
 the
 youthful
 virgin
 and
 Elisabeth
 already
 well
 advanced
 in
 life
 From
 what
 of
 Gabriels
 words
 her
 husband
 had
 communicated
 Elisabeth
 must
 have
 known
 that
 the
 approaching
 birth
 of
 her
 son
 would
 soon
 be
 followed
 by
 that
 of
 the
 Messiah
 and
 that
 therefore
 the
 day
 for
 which
 Israel
 had
 waited
 and
 prayed
 through
 the
 long
 dark
 centuries
 was
 about
 to
 dawn
 When
 Marys
 salutation
 fell
 upon
 her
 ears
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 bore
 witness
 that
 the
 chosen
 mother
 of
 the
 Lord
 stood
 before
 her
 in
 the
 person
 of
 her
 cousin
 and
 as
 she
 experienced
 the
 physical
 thrill
 incident
 to
 the
 quickening
 spirit
 of
 her
 own
 blessed
 conception
 she
 returned
 the
 greeting
 of
 her
 visitor
 with
 reverence
 Blessed
 art
 thou
 among
 women
 and
 blessed
 is
 the
 fruit
 of
 thy
 womb
 And
 whence
 is
 this
 to
 me
 that
 the
 mother
 of
 my
 Lord
 should
 come
 to
 me
 Mary
 responded
 with
 that
 glorious
 hymn
 of
 praise
 since
 adopted
 in
 the
 musical
 ritual
 of
 churches
 as
 the
 Magnificat
 My
 soul
 doth
 magnify
 the
 Lord
 and
 my
 spirit
 hath
 rejoiced
 in
 God
 my
 Saviour
 For
 he
 hath
 regarded
 the
 low
 estate
 of
 his
 handmaiden
 for
 behold
 from
 henceforth
 all
 generations
 shall
 call
 me
 blessed
 For
 he
 that
 is
 mighty
 hath
 done
 to
 me
 great
 things
 and
 holy
 is
 his
 name
 And
 his
 mercy
 is
 on
 them
 that
 fear
 him
 from
 generation
 to
 generation
 He
 hath
 shewed
 strength
 with
 his
 arm
 he
 hath
 scattered
 the
 proud
 in
 the
 imagination
 of
 their
 hearts
 He
 hath
 put
 down
 the
 mighty
 from
 their
 seats
 and
 exalted
 them
 of
 low
 degree
 He
 hath
 filled
 the
 hungry
 with
 good
 things
 and
 the
 rich
 he
 hath
 sent
 empty
 away
 He
 hath
 holpen
 his
 servant
 Israel
 in
 remembrance
 of
 his
 mercy
 as
 he
 spake
 to
 our
 fathers
 to
 Abraham
 and
 to
 his
 seed
 for
 ever
 MARY
 AND
 JOSEPH
 The
 visit
 lasted
 about
 three
 months
 after
 which
 time
 Mary
 returned
 to
 Nazareth
 The
 real
 embarrassment
 of
 her
 position
 she
 had
 now
 to
 meet
 At
 the
 home
 of
 her
 cousin
 she
 had
 been
 understood
 her
 condition
 had
 served
 to
 confirm
 the
 testimony
 of
 Zacharias
 and
 Elisabeth
 but
 how
 would
 her
 word
 be
 received
 at
 her
 own
 home
 And
 especially
 how
 would
 she
 be
 regarded
 by
 her
 espoused
 husband
 Betrothal
 or
 espousal
 in
 that
 time
 was
 in
 some
 respects
 as
 binding
 as
 the
 marriage
 vow
 and
 could
 only
 be
 set
 aside
 by
 a
 ceremonial
 separation
 akin
 to
 divorce
 yet
 an
 espousal
 was
 but
 an
 engagement
 to
 marry
 not
 a
 marriage
 When
 Joseph
 greeted
 his
 promised
 bride
 after
 her
 three
 months
 absence
 he
 was
 greatly
 distressed
 over
 the
 indications
 of
 her
 prospective
 maternity
 Now
 the
 Jewish
 law
 provided
 for
 the
 annulment
 of
 a
 betrothal
 in
 either
 of
 two
 waysby
 public
 trial
 and
 judgment
 or
 by
 private
 agreement
 attested
 by
 a
 written
 document
 signed
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 witnesses
 Joseph
 was
 a
 just
 man
 a
 strict
 observer
 of
 the
 law
 yet
 no
 harsh
 extremist
 moreover
 he
 loved
 Mary
 and
 would
 save
 her
 all
 unnecessary
 humiliation
 whatever
 might
 be
 his
 own
 sorrow
 and
 suffering
 For
 Marys
 sake
 he
 dreaded
 the
 thought
 of
 publicity
 and
 therefore
 determined
 to
 have
 the
 espousal
 annulled
 with
 such
 privacy
 the
 law
 allowed
 He
 was
 troubled
 and
 thought
 much
 of
 his
 duty
 in
 the
 matter
 when
 behold
 the
 angel
 of
 the
 Lord
 appeared
 unto
 him
 in
 a
 dream
 saying
 Joseph
 thou
 son
 of
 David
 fear
 not
 to
 take
 unto
 thee
 Mary
 thy
 wife
 for
 that
 which
 is
 conceived
 in
 her
 is
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 And
 she
 shall
 bring
 forth
 a
 son
 and
 thou
 shalt
 call
 his
 name
 JESUS
 for
 he
 shall
 save
 his
 people
 from
 their
 sins
 Great
 was
 Josephs
 relief
 of
 mind
 and
 great
 his
 joy
 in
 the
 realization
 that
 the
 long
 predicted
 coming
 of
 the
 Messiah
 was
 at
 hand
 the
 words
 of
 the
 prophets
 would
 be
 fulfilled
 a
 virgin
 and
 she
 the
 one
 in
 the
 world
 most
 dear
 to
 him
 had
 conceived
 and
 in
 due
 time
 would
 bring
 forth
 that
 blessed
 Son
 Emmanuel
 which
 name
 by
 interpretation
 means
 God
 with
 us
 The
 angels
 salutation
 was
 significant
 Joseph
 thou
 son
 of
 David
 was
 the
 form
 of
 address
 and
 the
 use
 of
 that
 royal
 title
 must
 have
 meant
 to
 Joseph
 that
 though
 he
 was
 of
 kingly
 lineage
 marriage
 with
 Mary
 would
 cast
 no
 shadow
 upon
 his
 family
 status
 Joseph
 waited
 not
 to
 insure
 Mary
 all
 possible
 protection
 and
 establish
 his
 full
 legal
 right
 as
 her
 lawful
 guardian
 he
 hastened
 the
 solemnization
 of
 the
 marriage
 and
 did
 as
 the
 angel
 of
 the
 Lord
 had
 bidden
 him
 and
 took
 unto
 him
 his
 wife
 and
 knew
 her
 not
 till
 she
 had
 brought
 forth
 her
 firstborn
 son
 and
 he
 called
 his
 name
 JESUS
 The
 national
 hope
 of
 a
 Messiah
 based
 on
 promise
 and
 prophecy
 had
 become
 confused
 in
 the
 Jewish
 mind
 through
 the
 influence
 of
 rabbinism
 with
 its
 many
 vagaries
 and
 its
 private
 interpretation
 made
 to
 appear
 authoritative
 by
 the
 artificially
 sustained
 prestige
 of
 the
 expositors
 yet
 certain
 conditions
 had
 been
 emphasized
 as
 essential
 even
 by
 the
 rabbis
 and
 by
 these
 essentials
 would
 be
 judged
 the
 claim
 of
 any
 Jew
 who
 might
 declare
 himself
 to
 be
 the
 long
 expected
 One
 It
 was
 beyond
 question
 that
 the
 Messiah
 was
 to
 be
 born
 within
 the
 tribe
 of
 Judah
 and
 through
 the
 line
 of
 descent
 from
 David
 and
 being
 of
 David
 He
 must
 of
 necessity
 be
 of
 the
 lineage
 of
 Abraham
 through
 whose
 posterity
 according
 to
 the
 covenant
 all
 nations
 of
 the
 earth
 were
 to
 be
 blessed
 Two
 genealogical
 records
 purporting
 to
 give
 the
 lineage
 of
 Jesus
 are
 found
 in
 the
 New
 Testament
 one
 in
 the
 first
 chapter
 of
 Matthew
 the
 other
 in
 the
 third
 chapter
 of
 Luke
 These
 records
 present
 several
 apparent
 discrepancies
 but
 such
 have
 been
 satisfactorily
 reconciled
 by
 the
 research
 of
 specialists
 in
 Jewish
 genealogy
 No
 detailed
 analysis
 of
 the
 matter
 will
 be
 attempted
 here
 but
 it
 should
 be
 borne
 in
 mind
 that
 the
 consensus
 of
 judgment
 on
 the
 part
 of
 investigators
 is
 that
 Matthews
 account
 is
 that
 of
 the
 royal
 lineage
 establishing
 the
 order
 of
 sequence
 among
 the
 legal
 successors
 to
 the
 throne
 of
 David
 while
 the
 account
 given
 by
 Luke
 is
 a
 personal
 pedigree
 demonstrating
 descent
 from
 David
 without
 adherence
 to
 the
 line
 of
 legal
 succession
 to
 the
 throne
 through
 primogeniture
 or
 nearness
 of
 kin
 Lukes
 record
 is
 regarded
 by
 many
 however
 as
 the
 pedigree
 of
 Mary
 while
 Matthews
 is
 accepted
 as
 that
 of
 Joseph
 The
 all
 important
 fact
 to
 be
 remembered
 is
 that
 the
 Child
 promised
 by
 Gabriel
 to
 Mary
 the
 virginal
 bride
 of
 Joseph
 would
 be
 born
 in
 the
 royal
 line
 A
 personal
 genealogy
 of
 Joseph
 was
 essentially
 that
 of
 Mary
 also
 for
 they
 were
 cousins
 Joseph
 is
 named
 as
 son
 of
 Jacob
 by
 Matthew
 and
 as
 son
 of
 Heli
 by
 Luke
 but
 Jacob
 and
 Heli
 were
 brothers
 and
 it
 appears
 that
 one
 of
 the
 two
 was
 the
 father
 of
 Joseph
 and
 the
 other
 the
 father
 of
 Mary
 and
 therefore
 fatherinlaw
 to
 Joseph
 That
 Mary
 was
 of
 Davidic
 descent
 is
 plainly
 set
 forth
 in
 many
 scriptures
 for
 since
 Jesus
 was
 to
 be
 born
 of
 Mary
 yet
 was
 not
 begotten
 by
 Joseph
 who
 was
 the
 reputed
 and
 according
 to
 the
 law
 of
 the
 Jews
 the
 legal
 father
 the
 blood
 of
 Davids
 posterity
 was
 given
 to
 the
 body
 of
 Jesus
 through
 Mary
 alone
 Our
 Lord
 though
 repeatedly
 addressed
 as
 Son
 of
 David
 never
 repudiated
 the
 title
 but
 accepted
 it
 as
 rightly
 applied
 to
 Himself
 Apostolic
 testimony
 stands
 in
 positive
 assertion
 of
 the
 royal
 heirship
 of
 Christ
 through
 earthly
 lineage
 as
 witness
 the
 affirmation
 of
 Paul
 the
 scholarly
 Pharisee
 Concerning
 his
 Son
 Jesus
 Christ
 our
 Lord
 which
 was
 made
 of
 the
 seed
 of
 David
 according
 to
 the
 flesh
 and
 again
 Remember
 that
 Jesus
 Christ
 of
 the
 seed
 of
 David
 was
 raised
 from
 the
 dead
 In
 all
 the
 persecutions
 waged
 by
 His
 implacable
 haters
 in
 all
 the
 false
 accusations
 brought
 against
 Him
 in
 the
 specific
 charges
 of
 sacrilege
 and
 blasphemy
 based
 on
 His
 acknowledgment
 of
 the
 Messiahship
 as
 His
 own
 no
 mention
 is
 found
 of
 even
 an
 insinuation
 that
 He
 could
 not
 be
 the
 Christ
 through
 any
 ineligibility
 based
 on
 lineage
 Genealogy
 was
 assiduously
 cared
 for
 by
 the
 Jews
 before
 during
 and
 after
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 indeed
 their
 national
 history
 was
 largely
 genealogical
 record
 and
 any
 possibility
 of
 denying
 the
 Christ
 because
 of
 unattested
 descent
 would
 have
 been
 used
 to
 the
 fullest
 extent
 by
 insistent
 Pharisee
 learned
 scribe
 haughty
 rabbi
 and
 aristocratic
 Sadducee
 At
 the
 time
 of
 the
 Saviors
 birth
 Israel
 was
 ruled
 by
 alien
 monarchs
 The
 rights
 of
 the
 royal
 Davidic
 family
 were
 unrecognized
 and
 the
 ruler
 of
 the
 Jews
 was
 an
 appointee
 of
 Rome
 Had
 Judah
 been
 a
 free
 and
 independent
 nation
 ruled
 by
 her
 rightful
 sovereign
 Joseph
 the
 carpenter
 would
 have
 been
 her
 crowned
 king
 and
 his
 lawful
 successor
 to
 the
 throne
 would
 have
 been
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 the
 King
 of
 the
 Jews
 Gabriels
 annunciation
 to
 Mary
 was
 that
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 David
 on
 whose
 coming
 the
 hope
 of
 Israel
 rested
 as
 on
 a
 sure
 foundation
 The
 One
 thus
 announced
 was
 Emmanuel
 even
 God
 who
 was
 to
 dwell
 in
 flesh
 with
 His
 people
 the
 Redeemer
 of

 NOTES
 TO
 CHAPTER
 
 
 John
 the
 Baptist
 Regarded
 as
 a
 NazariteThe
 instruction
 of
 the
 angel
 Gabriel
 to
 Zacharias
 that
 the
 promised
 son
 John
 was
 to
 drink
 neither
 wine
 nor
 strong
 drink
 and
 the
 adult
 life
 of
 John
 as
 a
 dweller
 in
 the
 desert
 together
 with
 his
 habit
 of
 wearing
 rough
 garb
 have
 led
 commentators
 and
 Biblical
 specialists
 to
 assume
 that
 he
 was
 a
 Nazarite
 for
 life
 It
 is
 to
 be
 remembered
 however
 that
 nowhere
 in
 scripture
 extant
 is
 John
 the
 Baptist
 definitely
 called
 a
 Nazarite
 A
 Nazarite
 the
 name
 signifying
 consecrated
 or
 separated
 was
 one
 who
 by
 personal
 vow
 or
 by
 that
 made
 for
 him
 by
 his
 parents
 was
 set
 apart
 to
 some
 special
 labor
 or
 course
 of
 life
 involving
 self
 denial
 See
 page
 
 Smiths
 Comp
 Dict
 of
 the
 Bible
 says
 There
 is
 no
 notice
 in
 the
 Pentateuch
 of
 Nazarites
 for
 life
 but
 the
 regulations
 for
 the
 vow
 of
 a
 Nazarite
 of
 days
 are
 given
 Numb
 
 The
 Nazarite
 during
 the
 term
 of
 his
 consecration
 was
 bound
 to
 abstain
 from
 wine
 grapes
 and
 every
 production
 of
 the
 vine
 and
 from
 every
 kind
 of
 intoxicating
 drink
 He
 was
 forbidden
 to
 cut
 the
 hair
 of
 his
 head
 or
 to
 approach
 any
 dead
 body
 even
 that
 of
 his
 nearest
 relation
 The
 sole
 instance
 of
 a
 Nazarite
 for
 life
 named
 in
 the
 scriptures
 is
 that
 of
 Samson
 whose
 mother
 was
 required
 to
 put
 herself
 under
 Nazarite
 observances
 prior
 to
 his
 birth
 and
 the
 child
 was
 to
 be
 a
 Nazarite
 to
 God
 from
 his
 birth
 Judges
 
 
 In
 the
 strictness
 of
 his
 life
 John
 the
 Baptist
 is
 to
 be
 credited
 with
 all
 the
 personal
 discipline
 required
 of
 Nazarites
 whether
 he
 was
 under
 voluntary
 or
 parental
 vows
 or
 was
 not
 so
 bound
 
 Circumcision
 while
 not
 exclusively
 a
 Hebrew
 or
 an
 Israelitish
 practise
 was
 made
 a
 definite
 requirement
 through
 the
 revelations
 of
 God
 to
 Abraham
 as
 the
 sign
 of
 the
 covenant
 between
 Jehovah
 and
 the
 patriarch
 Gen
 
 This
 covenant
 was
 made
 to
 include
 the
 establishment
 of
 Abrahams
 posterity
 as
 a
 great
 nation
 and
 provided
 that
 through
 his
 descendants
 should
 all
 nations
 of
 the
 earth
 be
 blessed
 Gen
 a
 promise
 which
 has
 been
 proved
 to
 mean
 that
 through
 that
 lineage
 should
 the
 Messiah
 be
 born
 Circumcision
 was
 a
 binding
 condition
 and
 its
 practise
 therefore
 became
 a
 national
 characteristic
 Every
 male
 was
 to
 be
 circumcized
 eight
 days
 after
 birth
 Gen
 
 Lev
 
 This
 requirement
 as
 to
 age
 came
 to
 be
 so
 rigidly
 enforced
 that
 even
 if
 the
 eighth
 day
 fell
 on
 a
 Sabbath
 the
 rite
 had
 to
 be
 performed
 on
 that
 day
 John
 
 
 All
 male
 slaves
 had
 to
 be
 circumcized
 Gen
 
 
 and
 even
 strangers
 who
 sojourned
 with
 the
 Hebrews
 and
 desired
 to
 partake
 of
 the
 Passover
 with
 them
 had
 to
 submit
 to
 the
 requirement
 Exo
 
 From
 the
 Standard
 Bible
 Dictionary
 we
 take
 the
 following
 The
 ceremony
 indicated
 the
 casting
 off
 of
 uncleanness
 as
 a
 preparation
 for
 entrance
 into
 the
 privileges
 of
 membership
 in
 Israel
 In
 the
 New
 Testament
 with
 its
 transfer
 of
 emphasis
 from
 the
 external
 and
 formal
 to
 the
 inner
 and
 spiritual
 side
 of
 things
 it
 was
 first
 declared
 unnecessary
 for
 Gentile
 converts
 to
 the
 gospel
 to
 be
 circumcized
 Acts
 
 and
 afterward
 the
 rite
 was
 set
 aside
 even
 by
 Jewish
 Christians
 It
 became
 customary
 to
 name
 a
 child
 at
 the
 time
 it
 was
 circumcized
 as
 is
 instanced
 in
 the
 case
 of
 John
 son
 of
 Zacharias
 Luke
 
 
 Zacharias
 AfflictionThe
 sign
 for
 which
 Zacharias
 asked
 was
 thus
 given
 by
 the
 angel
 Behold
 thou
 shalt
 be
 dumb
 and
 not
 able
 to
 speak
 until
 the
 day
 that
 these
 things
 shall
 be
 performed
 because
 thou
 believest
 not
 my
 words
 which
 shall
 be
 fulfilled
 in
 their
 season
 Luke
 
 From
 the
 account
 of
 the
 circumcision
 and
 naming
 of
 the
 boy
 John
 it
 is
 held
 by
 some
 that
 the
 afflicted
 father
 was
 also
 deaf
 as
 the
 company
 made
 signs
 to
 him
 as
 to
 how
 he
 would
 have
 his
 son
 named

 Jewish
 BetrothalThe
 vow
 of
 espousal
 or
 betrothal
 has
 always
 been
 regarded
 as
 sacred
 and
 binding
 in
 Jewish
 law
 In
 a
 manner
 it
 was
 as
 binding
 as
 a
 marriage
 ceremony
 though
 it
 carried
 none
 of
 the
 particular
 rights
 of
 marriage
 The
 following
 succinct
 statements
 are
 taken
 from

 and
 Words

 p
 
 Among
 the
 Jews
 of
 Marys
 day
 it
 was
 even
 more
 of
 an
 actual
 engagement
 than
 it
 later
 came
 to
 be
 The
 betrothal
 was
 formally
 made
 with
 rejoicings
 in
 the
 house
 of
 the
 bride
 under
 a
 tent
 or
 slight
 canopy
 raised
 for
 the
 purpose
 It
 was
 called
 the
 making
 sacred
 as
 the
 bride
 thenceforth
 was
 sacred
 to
 her
 husband
 in
 the
 strictest
 sense
 To
 make
 it
 legal
 the
 bridegroom
 gave
 his
 betrothed
 a
 piece
 of
 money
 or
 the
 worth
 of
 it
 before
 witnesses
 with
 the
 words
 Lo
 thou
 art
 betrothed
 unto
 me
 or
 by
 a
 formal
 writing
 in
 which
 similar
 words
 and
 the
 maidens
 name
 were
 given
 and
 this
 in
 the
 same
 way
 was
 handed
 to
 her
 before
 witnesses
 
 Genealogies
 of
 Joseph
 and
 MaryIt
 is
 now
 almost
 certain
 that
 the
 genealogies
 in
 both
 Gospels
 are
 genealogies
 of
 Joseph
 which
 if
 we
 may
 rely
 on
 early
 traditions
 of
 their
 consanguinity
 involve
 genealogies
 of
 Mary
 also
 The
 Davidic
 descent
 of
 Mary
 is
 implied
 in
 Acts
 
 
 Rom
 
 Luke
 
 etc
 St
 Matthew
 gives
 the
 legal
 descent
 of
 Joseph
 through
 the
 elder
 and
 regal
 line
 as
 heir
 to
 the
 throne
 of
 David
 St
 Luke
 gives
 the
 natural
 descent
 Thus
 the
 real
 father
 of
 Salathiel
 was
 heir
 of
 the
 house
 of
 Nathan
 but
 the
 childless
 Jeconiah
 Jer
 
 was
 the
 last
 lineal
 representative
 of
 the
 elder
 kingly
 line
 The
 omission
 of
 some
 obscure
 names
 and
 the
 symmetrical
 arrangement
 into
 tesseradecads
 were
 common
 Jewish
 customs
 It
 is
 not
 too
 much

 note
 The
 writer
 of
 the
 article
 Genealogy
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 in
 Smiths
 Bible
 Dict
 says
 The
 New
 Testament
 gives
 us
 the
 genealogy
 of
 but
 one
 person
 our
 Savior
 Matt
 
 Luke
 
 The
 following
 propositions
 will
 explain
 the
 true
 construction
 of
 these
 genealogies
 so
 Lord
 A
 C
 Hervey
 
 They
 are
 both
 the
 genealogies
 of
 Joseph
 ie
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 as
 the
 reputed
 and
 legal
 son
 of
 Joseph
 and
 Mary
 
 The
 genealogy
 of
 Matthew
 is
 as
 Grotius
 asserted
 Josephs
 genealogy
 as
 legal
 successor
 to
 the
 throne
 of
 David
 That
 of
 Luke
 is
 Josephs
 private
 genealogy
 exhibiting
 his
 real
 birth
 as
 Davids
 son
 and
 thus
 showing
 why
 he
 was
 heir
 to
 Solomons
 crown
 The
 simple
 principle
 that
 one
 evangelist
 exhibits
 that
 genealogy
 which
 contained
 the
 successive
 heirs
 to
 Davids
 and
 Solomons
 throne
 while
 the
 other
 exhibits
 the
 paternal
 stem
 of
 him
 who
 was
 the
 heir
 explains
 all
 the
 anomalies

 the
 two
 pedigrees

 agreements
 as
 well
 as
 their
 discrepancies

 the
 circumstance

 Mrs

 is
 an
 authority
 on
 Syriac
 manuscripts

 is
 one
 of
 the
 two
 women
 who
 in
 
 discovered

 Syriac
 palimpsest

 The
 gifted
 author
 holds
 that
 Matthews
 account
 attests
 the
 royal
 pedigree
 of
 Joseph
 and
 that
 Lukes
 genealogical
 table
 proves
 the
 equally
 royal
 descent
 of
 Mary
 Mrs
 Lewis
 says
 The
 Sinai
 Palimpsest
 also
 tells
 us
 that
 Joseph
 and
 Mary
 went
 to
 Bethlehem
 to
 be
 enrolled
 there
 because
 they
 were
 both
 of
 the
 house
 and
 lineage
 of
 David
 Canon
 Girdlestone
 in
 discussing
 the
 article
 says
 in
 pertinent
 emphasis
 of
 Marys
 status
 as
 a
 princess
 of
 royal
 blood
 through
 descent
 from
 David
 When
 the
 angel
 was
 foretelling
 to
 Mary
 the
 birth
 of
 the
 Holy
 Child
 he
 said
 The
 Lord
 God
 shall
 give
 Him
 the
 throne
 of
 His
 father
 David
 Now
 if
 Joseph
 her
 betrothed
 had
 alone
 been
 descended
 from
 David
 Mary
 would
 have
 answered
 I
 am
 not
 yet
 married
 to
 Joseph
 whereas
 she
 did
 answer
 simply
 I
 am
 an
 unmarried
 woman
 which
 plainly
 impliesif
 I
 were
 married
 since
 I
 am
 descended
 from
 David
 I
 could
 infuse
 my
 royal
 blood
 into
 a
 son
 but
 how
 can
 I
 have
 a
 royal
 son
 while
 I
 am
 a
 virgin
 After
 brief
 mention
 of
 the
 Jewish
 law
 relating
 to
 adoption
 wherein
 it
 is
 provided
 according
 to
 Hammurabis
 Code
 section
 
 that
 if
 a
 man
 teach
 his
 adopted
 son
 a
 handicraft
 the
 son
 is
 thereby
 confirmed
 in
 all
 the
 rights
 of
 heirship
 Canon
 Girdlestone
 adds
 If
 the
 crown
 of
 David
 had
 been
 assigned
 to
 his
 successor
 in
 the
 days
 of
 Herod
 it
 would
 have
 been
 placed
 on
 the
 head
 of
 Joseph
 And
 who
 would
 have
 been
 the
 legal
 successor
 to
 Joseph
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 would
 have
 been
 then
 the
 King
 of

 The
 Inner
 Sanctuary
 of
 the
 TempleThe
 Holy

 Holies
 in
 the
 Temple

 Herod
 retained
 the
 form

 of

 it
 was
 therefore
 a

 Between

 The
 outer
 of

 that

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 BABE
 OF
 BETHLEHEM
 THE
 BIRTH
 OF
 JESUS
 Equally
 definite
 with
 the
 prophecies
 declaring
 that
 the
 Messiah
 would
 be
 born
 in
 the
 lineage
 of
 David
 are
 the
 predictions
 that
 fix
 the
 place
 of
 His
 birth
 at
 Bethlehem
 a
 small
 town
 in
 Judea
 There
 seems
 to
 have
 been
 no
 difference
 of
 opinion
 among
 priests
 scribes
 or
 rabbis
 on
 the
 matter
 either
 before
 or
 since
 the
 great
 event
 Bethlehem
 though
 small
 and
 of
 little
 importance
 in
 trade
 or
 commerce
 was
 doubly
 endeared
 to
 the
 Jewish
 heart
 as
 the
 birthplace
 of
 David
 and
 as
 that
 of
 the
 prospective
 Messiah
 Mary
 and
 Joseph
 lived
 in
 Nazareth
 of
 Galilee
 far
 removed
 from
 Bethlehem
 of
 Judea
 and
 at
 the
 time
 of
 which
 we
 speak
 the
 maternity
 of
 the
 Virgin
 was
 fast
 approaching
 At
 that
 time
 a
 decree
 went
 out
 from
 Rome
 ordering
 a
 taxing
 of
 the
 people
 in
 all
 kingdoms
 and
 provinces
 tributary
 to
 the
 empire
 the
 call
 was
 of
 general
 scope
 it
 provided
 that
 all
 the
 world
 should
 be
 taxed
 The
 taxing
 herein
 referred
 to
 may
 properly
 be
 understood
 as
 an
 enrolment
 or
 a
 registration
 whereby
 a
 census
 of
 Roman
 subjects
 would
 be
 secured
 upon
 which
 as
 a
 basis
 the
 taxation
 of
 the
 different
 peoples
 would
 be
 determined
 This
 particular
 census
 was
 the
 second
 of
 three
 such
 general
 registrations
 recorded
 by
 historians
 as
 occurring
 at
 intervals
 of
 about
 twenty
 years
 Had
 the
 census
 been
 taken
 by
 the
 usual
 Roman
 method
 each
 person
 would
 have
 been
 enrolled
 at
 the
 town
 of
 his
 residence
 but
 the
 Jewish
 custom
 for
 which
 the
 Roman
 law
 had
 respect
 necessitated
 registration
 at
 the
 cities
 or
 towns
 claimed
 by
 the
 respective
 families
 as
 their
 ancestral
 homes
 As
 to
 whether
 the
 requirement
 was
 strictly
 mandatory
 that
 every
 family
 should
 thus
 register
 at
 the
 city
 of
 its
 ancestors
 we
 need
 not
 be
 specially
 concerned
 certain
 it
 is
 that
 Joseph
 and
 Mary
 went
 to
 Bethlehem
 the
 city
 of
 David
 to
 be
 inscribed
 under
 the
 imperial
 decree
 The
 little
 town
 was
 crowded
 at
 the
 time
 most
 likely
 by
 the
 multitude
 that
 had
 come
 in
 obedience
 to
 the
 same
 summons
 and
 in
 consequence
 Joseph
 and
 Mary
 failed
 to
 find
 the
 most
 desirable
 accommodations
 and
 had
 to
 be
 content
 with
 the
 conditions
 of
 an
 improvised
 camp
 as
 travelers
 unnumbered
 had
 done
 before
 and
 as
 uncounted
 others
 have
 done
 since
 in
 that
 region
 and
 elsewhere
 We
 cannot
 reasonably
 regard
 this
 circumstance
 as
 evidence
 of
 extreme
 destitution
 doubtless
 it
 entailed
 inconvenience
 but
 it
 gives
 us
 no
 assurance
 of
 great
 distress
 or
 suffering
 It
 was
 while
 she
 was
 in
 this
 situation
 that
 Mary
 the
 Virgin
 gave
 birth
 to
 her
 firstborn
 the
 Son
 of
 the
 Highest
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 of
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 But
 few
 details
 of
 attendant
 circumstances
 are
 furnished
 us
 We
 are
 not
 told
 how
 soon
 the
 birth
 occurred
 after
 the
 arrival
 of
 Mary
 and
 her
 husband
 at
 Bethlehem
 It
 may
 have
 been
 the
 purpose
 of
 the
 evangelist
 who
 made
 the
 record
 to
 touch
 upon
 matters
 of
 purely
 human
 interest
 as
 lightly
 as
 was
 consistent
 with
 the
 narration
 of
 fact
 in
 order
 that
 the
 central
 truth
 might
 neither
 be
 hidden
 nor
 overshadowed
 by
 unimportant
 incident
 We
 read
 in
 Holy
 Writ
 this
 only
 of
 the
 actual
 birth
 And
 so
 it
 was
 that
 while
 they
 were
 there
 the
 days
 were
 accomplished
 that
 she
 should
 be
 delivered
 And
 she
 brought
 forth
 her
 firstborn
 son
 and
 wrapped
 him
 in
 swaddling
 clothes
 and
 laid
 him
 in
 a
 manger
 became
 there
 was
 no
 room
 for
 them
 at
 the
 inn
 In
 vivid
 contrast
 with
 the
 simplicity
 and
 brevity
 of
 the
 scriptural
 account
 and
 of
 its
 paucity
 of
 incidental
 details
 is
 the
 mass
 of
 circumstance
 supplied
 by
 the
 imagination
 of
 men
 much
 of
 which
 is
 wholly
 unsupported
 by
 authoritative
 record
 and
 in
 many
 respects
 is
 plainly
 inconsistent
 and
 untrue
 It
 is
 the
 part
 of
 prudence
 and
 wisdom
 to
 segregate
 and
 keep
 distinctly
 separate
 the
 authenticated
 statements
 of
 fact
 in
 so
 momentous
 a
 matter
 from
 the
 fanciful
 commentaries
 of
 historians
 theologians
 and
 writers
 of
 fiction
 as
 also
 from
 the
 emotional
 rhapsodies
 of
 poets
 and
 artistic
 extravaganzas
 wrought
 by
 chisel
 or
 brush
 From
 the
 period
 of
 its
 beginning
 Bethlehem
 had
 been
 the
 home
 of
 people
 engaged
 mostly
 in
 pastoral
 and
 agricultural
 pursuits
 It
 is
 quite
 in
 line
 with
 what
 is
 known
 of
 the
 town
 and
 its
 environs
 to
 find
 at
 the
 season
 of
 Messiahs
 birth
 which
 was
 in
 the
 springtime
 of
 the
 year
 that
 flocks
 were
 in
 the
 field
 both
 night
 and
 day
 under
 the
 watchful
 care
 of
 their
 keepers
 Unto
 certain
 of
 these
 humble
 shepherds
 came
 the
 first
 proclamation
 that
 the
 Savior
 had
 been
 born
 Thus
 runs
 the
 simple
 record
 And
 there
 were
 in
 the
 same
 country
 shepherds
 abiding
 in
 the
 field
 keeping
 watch
 over
 their
 flock
 by
 night
 And
 lo
 the
 angel
 of
 the
 Lord
 came
 upon
 them
 and
 the
 glory
 of
 the
 Lord
 shone
 round
 about
 them
 and
 they
 were
 sore
 afraid
 And
 the
 angel
 said
 unto
 them
 Fear
 not
 for
 behold
 I
 bring
 you
 good
 tidings
 of
 great
 joy
 which
 shall
 be
 to
 all
 people
 For
 unto
 you
 is
 born
 this
 day
 in
 the
 city
 of
 David
 a
 Saviour
 which
 is
 Christ
 the
 Lord
 And
 this
 shall
 be
 a
 sign
 unto
 you
 Ye
 shall
 find
 the
 babe
 wrapped
 in
 swaddling
 clothes
 lying
 in
 a
 manger
 And
 suddenly
 there
 was
 with
 the
 angel
 a
 multitude
 of
 the
 heavenly
 host
 praising
 God
 and
 saying
 Glory
 to
 God
 in
 the
 highest
 and
 on
 earth
 peace
 good
 will
 toward
 men
 Tidings
 of
 such
 import
 had
 never
 before
 been
 delivered
 by
 angel
 or
 received
 by
 mangood
 tidings
 of
 great
 joy
 given
 to
 but
 few
 and
 those
 among
 the
 humblest
 of
 earth
 but
 destined
 to
 spread
 to
 all
 people
 There
 is
 sublime
 grandeur
 in
 the
 scene
 as
 there
 is
 divine
 authorship
 in
 the
 message
 and
 the
 climax
 is
 such
 as
 the
 mind
 of
 man
 could
 never
 have
 conceivedthe
 sudden
 appearance
 of
 a
 multitude
 of
 the
 heavenly
 host
 singing
 audibly
 to
 human
 ears
 the
 briefest
 most
 consistent
 and
 most
 truly
 complete
 of
 all
 the
 songs
 of
 peace
 ever
 attuned
 by
 mortal
 or
 spirit
 choir
 What
 a
 consummation
 to
 be
 wishedPeace
 on
 earth
 But
 how
 can
 such
 come
 except
 through
 the
 maintenance
 of
 good
 will
 toward
 men
 And
 through
 what
 means
 could
 glory
 to
 God
 in
 the
 highest
 be
 more
 effectively
 rendered
 The
 trustful
 and
 unsophisticated
 keepers
 of
 sheep
 had
 not
 asked
 for
 sign
 or
 confirmation
 their
 faith
 was
 in
 unison
 with
 the
 heavenly
 communication
 nevertheless
 the
 angel
 had
 given
 them
 what
 he
 called
 a
 sign
 to
 guide
 them
 in
 their
 search
 They
 waited
 not
 but
 went
 in
 haste
 for
 in
 their
 hearts
 they
 believed
 yea
 more
 than
 believed
 they
 knew
 and
 this
 was
 the
 tenor
 of
 their
 resolve
 Let
 us
 now
 go
 even
 unto
 Bethlehem
 and
 see
 this
 thing
 which
 is
 come
 to
 pass
 which
 the
 Lord
 hath
 made
 known
 unto
 us
 They
 found
 the
 Babe
 in
 the
 manger
 with
 the
 mother
 and
 Joseph
 near
 by
 and
 having
 seen
 they
 went
 out
 and
 testified
 to
 the
 truth
 concerning
 the
 Child
 They
 returned
 to
 their
 flocks
 glorifying
 and
 praising
 God
 for
 all
 they
 had
 heard
 and
 seen
 There
 is
 meaning
 as
 deep
 as
 the
 pathos
 that
 all
 must
 feel
 in
 the
 seemingly
 parenthetical
 remark
 by
 Luke
 But
 Mary
 kept
 all
 these
 things
 and
 pondered
 them
 in
 her
 heart
 It
 is
 apparent
 that
 the
 great
 truth
 as
 to
 the
 personality
 and
 mission
 of
 her
 divine
 Son
 had
 not
 yet
 unfolded
 itself
 in
 its
 fulness
 to
 her
 mind
 The
 whole
 course
 of
 events
 from
 the
 salutation
 of
 Gabriel
 to
 the
 reverent
 testimony
 of
 the
 shepherds
 concerning
 the
 announcing
 angel
 and
 the
 heavenly
 hosts
 was
 largely
 a
 mystery
 to
 that
 stainless
 mother
 and
 wife
 REQUIREMENTS
 OF
 THE
 LAW
 STRICTLY
 OBSERVED
 The
 Child
 was
 born
 a
 Jew
 the
 mother
 was
 a
 Jewess
 and
 the
 reputed
 and
 legal
 father
 Joseph
 was
 a
 Jew
 The
 true
 paternity
 of
 the
 Child
 was
 known
 to
 but
 few
 perhaps
 at
 that
 time
 to
 none
 save
 Mary
 Joseph
 and
 possibly
 Elisabeth
 and
 Zacharias
 as
 He
 grew
 He
 was
 regarded
 by
 the
 people
 as
 Josephs
 son
 The
 requirements
 of
 the
 law
 were
 carried
 out
 with
 exactitude
 in
 all
 matters
 pertaining
 to
 the
 Child
 When
 eight
 days
 old
 He
 was
 circumcized
 as
 was
 required
 of
 every
 male
 born
 in
 Israel
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 He
 received
 as
 an
 earthly
 bestowal
 the
 name
 that
 had
 been
 prescribed
 at
 the
 annunciation
 He
 was
 called
 JESUS
 which
 being
 interpreted
 is
 Savior
 the
 name
 was
 rightfully
 His
 for
 He
 came
 to
 save
 the
 people
 from
 their
 sins
 Part
 of
 the
 law
 given
 through
 Moses
 to
 the
 Israelites
 in
 the
 wilderness
 and
 continued
 in
 force
 down
 through
 the
 centuries
 related
 to
 the
 procedure
 prescribed
 for
 women
 after
 childbirth
 In
 compliance
 therewith
 Mary
 remained
 in
 retirement
 forty
 days
 following
 the
 birth
 of
 her
 Son
 then
 she
 and
 her
 husband
 brought
 the
 Boy
 for
 presentation
 before
 the
 Lord
 as
 prescribed
 for
 the
 male
 firstborn
 of
 every
 family
 It
 is
 manifestly
 impossible
 that
 all
 such
 presentations
 could
 have
 taken
 place
 in
 the
 temple
 for
 many
 Jews
 lived
 at
 great
 distances
 from
 Jerusalem
 it
 was
 the
 rule
 however
 that
 parents
 should
 present
 their
 children
 in
 the
 temple
 when
 possible
 Jesus
 was
 born
 within
 five
 or
 six
 miles
 from
 Jerusalem
 He
 was
 accordingly
 taken
 to
 the
 temple
 for
 the
 ceremonial
 of
 redemption
 from
 the
 requirement
 applying
 to
 the
 firstborn
 of
 all
 Israelites
 except
 Levites
 It
 will
 be
 remembered
 that
 the
 children
 of
 Israel
 had
 been
 delivered
 from
 the
 bondage
 of
 Egypt
 with
 the
 accompaniment
 of
 signs
 and
 wonders
 Because
 of
 Pharaohs
 repeated
 refusals
 to
 let
 the
 people
 go
 plagues
 had
 been
 brought
 upon
 the
 Egyptians
 one
 of
 which
 was
 the
 death
 of
 the
 firstborn
 throughout
 the
 land
 excepting
 only
 the
 people
 of
 Israel
 In
 remembrance
 of
 this
 manifestation
 of
 power
 the
 Israelites
 were
 required
 to
 dedicate
 their
 firstborn
 sons
 to
 the
 service
 of
 the
 sanctuary
 Subsequently
 the
 Lord
 directed
 that
 all
 males
 belonging
 to
 the
 tribe
 of
 Levi
 should
 be
 devoted
 to
 this
 special
 labor
 instead
 of
 the
 firstborn
 in
 every
 tribe
 nevertheless
 the
 eldest
 son
 was
 still
 claimed
 as
 particularly
 the
 Lords
 own
 and
 had
 to
 be
 formally
 exempted
 from
 the
 earlier
 requirement
 of
 service
 by
 the
 paying
 of
 a
 ransom
 In
 connection
 with
 the
 ceremony
 of
 purification
 every
 mother
 was
 required
 to
 furnish
 a
 yearling
 lamb
 for
 a
 burnt
 offering
 and
 a
 young
 pigeon
 or
 dove
 for
 a
 sin
 offering
 but
 in
 the
 case
 of
 any
 woman
 who
 was
 unable
 to
 provide
 a
 lamb
 a
 pair
 of
 doves
 or
 pigeons
 might
 be
 offered
 We
 learn
 of
 the
 humble
 circumstances
 of
 Joseph
 and
 Mary
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 they
 brought
 the
 less
 costly
 offering
 two
 doves
 or
 pigeons
 instead
 of
 one
 bird
 and
 a
 lamb
 Among
 the
 righteous
 and
 devout
 Israelites
 were
 some
 who
 in
 spite
 of
 traditionalism
 rabbinism
 and
 priestly
 corruption
 still
 lived
 in
 righteous
 expectation
 of
 inspired
 confidence
 awaiting
 patiently
 the
 consolation
 of
 Israel
 One
 of
 these
 was
 Simeon
 then
 living
 in
 Jerusalem
 Through
 the
 power
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 he
 had
 gained
 the
 promise
 that
 he
 should
 not
 see
 death
 until
 he
 had
 looked
 upon
 the
 Lords
 Christ
 in
 the
 flesh
 Prompted
 by
 the
 Spirit
 he
 repaired
 to
 the
 temple
 on
 the
 day
 of
 the
 presentation
 of
 Jesus
 and
 recognized
 in
 the
 Babe
 the
 promised
 Messiah
 In
 the
 moment
 of
 realization
 that
 the
 hope
 of
 his
 life
 had
 found
 glorious
 consummation
 Simeon
 raised
 the
 Child
 reverently
 in
 his
 arms
 and
 with
 the
 simple
 but
 undying
 eloquence
 that
 comes
 of
 God
 uttered
 this
 splendid
 supplication
 in
 which
 thanksgiving
 resignation
 and
 praise
 are
 so
 richly
 blended
 Lord
 now
 lettest
 thou
 thy
 servant
 depart
 in
 peace
 according
 to
 thy
 word
 for
 mine
 eyes
 have
 seen
 thy
 salvation
 which
 thou
 hast
 prepared
 before
 the
 face
 of
 all
 people
 a
 light
 to
 lighten
 the
 Gentiles
 and
 the
 glory
 of
 thy
 people
 Israel
 Then
 under
 the
 spirit
 of
 prophecy
 Simeon
 told
 of
 the
 greatness
 of
 the
 Childs
 mission
 and
 of
 the
 anguish
 that
 the
 mother
 would
 be
 called
 to
 endure
 because
 of
 Him
 which
 would
 be
 even
 like
 unto
 that
 of
 a
 sword
 piercing
 her
 soul
 The
 Spirits
 witness
 to
 the
 divinity
 of
 Jesus
 was
 not
 to
 be
 confined
 to
 a
 man
 There
 was
 at
 that
 time
 in
 the
 temple
 a
 godly
 woman
 of
 great
 age
 Anna
 a
 prophetess
 who
 devoted
 herself
 exclusively
 to
 temple
 service
 and
 she
 being
 inspired
 of
 God
 recognized
 her
 Redeemer
 and
 testified
 of
 Him
 to
 all
 about
 her
 Both
 Joseph
 and
 Mary
 marveled
 at
 the
 things
 that
 were
 spoken
 of
 the
 Child
 seemingly
 they
 were
 not
 yet
 able
 to
 comprehend
 the
 majesty
 of
 Him
 who
 had
 come
 to
 them
 through
 so
 miraculous
 a
 conception
 and
 so
 marvelous
 a
 birth
 WISE
 MEN
 SEARCH
 FOR
 THE
 KING
 Some
 time
 after
 the
 presentation
 of
 Jesus
 in
 the
 temple
 though
 how
 long
 we
 are
 not
 told
 possibly
 but
 a
 few
 days
 possibly
 weeks
 or
 even
 months
 Herod
 king
 of
 Judea
 was
 greatly
 troubled
 as
 were
 the
 people
 of
 Jerusalem
 in
 general
 over
 the
 report
 that
 a
 Child
 of
 Prophecyone
 destined
 to
 become
 King
 of
 the
 Jewshad
 been
 born
 Herod
 was
 professedly
 an
 adherent
 of
 the
 religion
 of
 Judah
 though
 by
 birth
 an
 Idumean
 by
 descent
 an
 Edomite
 or
 one
 of
 the
 posterity
 of
 Esau
 all
 of
 whom
 the
 Jews
 hated
 and
 of
 all
 Edomites
 not
 one
 was
 more
 bitterly
 detested
 than
 was
 Herod
 the
 king
 He
 was
 tyrannical
 and
 merciless
 sparing
 neither
 foe
 nor
 friend
 who
 came
 under
 suspicion
 of
 being
 a
 possible
 hindrance
 to
 his
 ambitious
 designs
 He
 had
 his
 wife
 and
 several
 of
 his
 sons
 as
 well
 as
 others
 of
 his
 blood
 kindred
 cruelly
 murdered
 and
 he
 put
 to
 death
 nearly
 all
 of
 the
 great
 national
 council
 the
 Sanhedrin
 His
 reign
 was
 one
 of
 revolting
 cruelty
 and
 unbridled
 oppression
 Only
 when
 in
 danger
 of
 inciting
 a
 national
 revolt
 or
 in
 fear
 of
 incurring
 the
 displeasure
 of
 his
 imperial
 master
 the
 Roman
 emperor
 did
 he
 stay
 his
 hand
 in
 any
 undertaking
 Rumors
 of
 the
 birth
 of
 Jesus
 reached
 Herods
 ears
 in
 this
 way
 There
 came
 to
 Jerusalem
 certain
 men
 from
 afar
 wise
 men
 they
 were
 called
 and
 they
 asked
 Where
 is
 he
 that
 is
 born
 King
 of
 the
 Jews
 for
 we
 have
 seen
 his
 star
 in
 the
 east
 and
 are
 come
 to
 worship
 him
 Herod
 summoned
 all
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 scribes
 of
 the
 people
 and
 demanded
 of
 them
 where
 according
 to
 the
 prophets
 Christ
 should
 be
 born
 They
 answered
 him
 In
 Bethlehem
 of
 Judea
 for
 thus
 it
 is
 written
 by
 the
 prophet
 And
 thou
 Bethlehem
 in
 the
 land
 of
 Juda
 art
 not
 the
 least
 among
 the
 princes
 of
 Juda
 for
 out
 of
 thee
 shall
 come
 a
 Governor
 that
 shall
 rule
 my
 people
 Israel
 Herod
 sent
 secretly
 for
 the
 wise
 men
 and
 inquired
 of
 them
 as
 to
 the
 source
 of
 their
 information
 and
 particularly
 as
 to
 the
 time
 at
 which
 the
 star
 to
 which
 they
 attached
 such
 significance
 had
 appeared
 Then
 he
 directed
 them
 to
 Bethlehem
 saying
 Go
 and
 search
 diligently
 for
 the
 young
 child
 and
 when
 ye
 have
 found
 him
 bring
 me
 word
 again
 that
 I
 may
 come
 and
 worship
 him
 also
 As
 the
 men
 set
 out
 from
 Jerusalem
 on
 the
 last
 stage
 of
 their
 journey
 of
 inquiry
 and
 search
 they
 rejoiced
 exceedingly
 for
 the
 new
 star
 they
 had
 seen
 in
 the
 east
 was
 again
 visible
 They
 found
 the
 house
 wherein
 Mary
 was
 living
 with
 her
 husband
 and
 the
 Babe
 and
 as
 they
 recognized
 the
 royal
 Child
 they
 fell
 down
 and
 worshipped
 him
 and
 when
 they
 had
 opened
 their
 treasures
 they
 presented
 unto
 him
 gifts
 gold
 and
 frankincense
 and
 myrrh
 Having
 thus
 gloriously
 accomplished
 the
 purpose
 of
 their
 pilgrimage
 these
 devout
 and
 learned
 travelers
 prepared
 to
 return
 home
 and
 would
 have
 stopped
 at
 Jerusalem
 to
 report
 to
 the
 king
 as
 he
 had
 requested
 but
 being
 warned
 of
 God
 in
 a
 dream
 that
 they
 should
 not
 return
 to
 Herod
 they
 departed
 into
 their
 own
 country
 another
 way
 Much
 has
 been
 written
 beyond
 all
 possible
 warrant
 of
 scriptural
 authority
 concerning
 the
 visit
 of
 the
 magi
 or
 wise
 men
 who
 thus
 sought
 and
 found
 the
 infant
 Christ
 As
 a
 matter
 of
 fact
 we
 are
 left
 without
 information
 as
 to
 their
 country
 nation
 or
 tribal
 relationship
 we
 are
 not
 even
 told
 how
 many
 they
 were
 though
 unauthenticated
 tradition
 has
 designated
 them
 as
 the
 three
 wise
 men
 and
 has
 even
 given
 them
 names
 whereas
 they
 are
 left
 unnamed
 in
 the
 scriptures
 the
 only
 true
 record
 of
 them
 extant
 and
 may
 have
 numbered
 but
 two
 or
 many
 Attempts
 have
 been
 made
 to
 identify
 the
 star
 whose
 appearance
 in
 their
 eastern
 sky
 had
 assured
 the
 magi
 that
 the
 King
 was
 born
 but
 astronomy
 furnishes
 no
 satisfactory
 confirmation
 The
 recorded
 appearance
 of
 the
 star
 has
 been
 associated
 by
 both
 ancient
 and
 modern
 interpreters
 with
 the
 prophecy
 of
 Balaam
 who
 though
 not
 an
 Israelite
 had
 blessed
 Israel
 and
 under
 divine
 inspiration
 had
 predicted
 there
 shall
 come
 a
 Star
 out
 of
 Jacob
 and
 a
 Sceptre
 shall
 rise
 out
 of
 Israel
 Moreover
 as
 already
 shown
 the
 appearance
 of
 a
 new
 star
 was
 a
 predicted
 sign
 recognized
 and
 acknowledged
 among
 the
 people
 of
 the
 western
 world
 as
 witness
 of
 Messiahs
 birth
 THE
 FLIGHT
 INTO
 EGYPT
 Herods
 perfidy
 in
 directing
 the
 magi
 to
 return
 and
 report
 to
 him
 where
 the
 royal
 Infant
 was
 to
 be
 found
 falsely
 professing
 that
 he
 wished
 to
 worship
 Him
 also
 while
 in
 his
 heart
 he
 purposed
 taking
 the
 Childs
 life
 was
 thwarted
 by
 the
 divine
 warning
 given
 to
 the
 wise
 men
 as
 already
 noted
 Following
 their
 departure
 the
 angel
 of
 the
 Lord
 appeared
 to
 Joseph
 saying
 Arise
 and
 take
 the
 young
 child
 and
 his
 mother
 and
 flee
 into
 Egypt
 and
 be
 thou
 there
 until
 I
 bring
 thee
 word
 for
 Herod
 will
 seek
 the
 young
 child
 to
 destroy
 him
 In
 obedience
 to
 this
 command
 Joseph
 took
 Mary
 and
 her
 Child
 and
 set
 out
 by
 night
 on
 the
 journey
 to
 Egypt
 and
 there
 the
 family
 remained
 until
 divinely
 directed
 to
 return
 When
 it
 was
 apparent
 to
 the
 king
 that
 the
 wise
 men
 had
 ignored
 his
 instructions
 he
 was
 exceedingly
 angry
 and
 estimating
 the
 earliest
 time
 at
 which
 the
 birth
 could
 have
 occurred
 according
 to
 the
 magis
 statement
 of
 the
 stars
 appearing
 he
 ruthlessly
 ordered
 the

 of

 the
 children
 that
 were

 BIRTH
 OF
 JESUS
 MADE
 KNOWN
 TO
 THE
 NEPHITES
 As
 heretofore
 shown
 the
 prophets
 of
 the
 western
 hemisphere
 had
 foretold
 in
 great
 plainness
 the
 earthly
 advent
 of
 the
 Lord
 and
 had
 specifically
 set
 forth
 the
 time
 place
 and
 circumstances
 of
 His
 birth
 As
 the
 time
 drew
 near
 the
 people
 were
 divided
 by
 conflicting
 opinions
 concerning
 the
 reliability
 of
 these
 prophecies
 and
 intolerant
 unbelievers
 cruelly
 persecuted
 those
 who
 like
 Zacharias
 Simeon
 Anna
 and
 other
 righteous
 ones
 in
 Palestine
 had
 maintained
 in
 faith
 and
 trust
 their
 unwavering
 expectation
 of
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Lord
 Samuel
 a
 righteous
 Lamanite
 who
 because
 of
 his
 faithfulness
 and
 sacrificing
 devotion
 had
 been
 blessed
 with
 the
 spirit
 and
 power
 of
 prophecy
 fearlessly
 proclaimed
 the
 birth
 of
 Christ
 as
 near
 And
 behold
 he
 said
 unto
 them
 Behold
 I
 give
 unto
 you
 a
 sign
 for
 five
 years
 more
 cometh
 and
 behold
 then
 cometh
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 to
 redeem
 all
 those
 who
 shall
 believe
 on
 his
 name
 The
 prophet
 told
 of
 many
 signs
 and
 wonders
 which
 were
 to
 mark
 the
 great
 event
 As
 the
 five
 years
 ran
 their
 course
 the
 believers
 grew
 more
 steadfast
 the
 unbelievers
 more
 violent
 until
 the
 last
 day
 of
 the
 specified
 period
 dawned
 and
 this
 was
 the
 day
 set
 apart
 by
 the
 unbelievers
 that
 all
 those
 who
 believed
 in
 those
 traditions
 should
 be
 put
 to
 death
 except
 the
 sign
 should
 come
 to
 pass
 which
 had
 been
 given
 by
 Samuel
 the
 prophet
 Nephi
 a
 prophet
 of
 the
 time
 cried
 unto
 the
 Lord
 in
 anguish
 of
 soul
 because
 of
 the
 persecution
 of
 which
 his
 people
 were
 the
 victims
 and
 behold
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 Lord
 came
 unto
 him
 saying
 Lift
 up
 your
 head
 and
 be
 of
 good
 cheer
 for
 behold
 the
 time
 is
 at
 hand
 and
 on
 this
 night
 shall
 the
 sign
 be
 given
 and
 on
 the
 morrow
 come
 I
 into
 the
 world
 to
 shew
 unto
 the
 world
 that
 I
 will
 fulfil
 all
 that
 which
 I
 have
 caused
 to
 be
 spoken
 by
 the
 mouth
 of
 my
 holy
 prophets
 Behold
 I
 come
 unto
 my
 own
 to
 fulfil
 all
 things
 which
 I
 have
 made
 known
 unto
 the
 children
 of
 men
 from
 the
 foundation
 of
 the
 world
 and
 do
 the
 will
 both
 of
 the
 Father
 and
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 the
 Father
 because
 of
 me
 and
 of
 the
 Son
 because
 of
 my
 flesh
 And
 behold
 the
 time
 is
 at
 hand
 and
 this
 night
 shall
 the
 sign
 be
 given
 The
 words
 of
 the
 prophet
 were
 fulfilled
 that
 night
 for
 though
 the
 sun
 set
 in
 its
 usual
 course
 there
 was
 no
 darkness
 and
 on
 the
 morrow
 the
 sun
 rose
 on
 a
 land
 already
 illumined
 a
 day
 and
 a
 night
 and
 another
 day
 had
 been
 as
 one
 day
 and
 this
 was
 but
 one
 of
 the
 signs
 A
 new
 star
 appeared
 in
 the
 firmament
 of
 the
 west
 even
 as
 was
 seen
 by
 the
 magi
 in
 the
 east
 and
 there
 were
 many
 other
 marvelous
 manifestations
 as
 the
 prophets
 had
 predicted
 All
 these
 things
 occurred
 on
 what
 is
 now
 known
 as
 the
 American
 continent
 six
 hundred
 years
 after
 Lehi
 and
 his
 little
 company
 had
 left
 Jerusalem
 to
 come
 hither
 THE
 TIME
 OF
 THE
 BIRTH
 OF
 JESUS
 The
 time
 of
 Messiahs
 birth
 is
 a
 subject
 upon
 which
 specialists
 in
 theology
 and
 history
 and
 those
 who
 are
 designated
 in
 literature
 the
 learned
 fail
 to
 agree
 Numerous
 lines
 of
 investigation
 have
 been
 followed
 only
 to
 reach
 divergent
 conclusions
 both
 as
 to
 the
 year
 and
 as
 to
 the
 month
 and
 day
 within
 the
 year
 at
 which
 the
 Christian
 era
 in
 reality
 began
 The
 establishment
 of
 the
 birth
 of
 Christ
 as
 an
 event
 marking
 a
 time
 from
 which
 chronological
 data
 should
 be
 calculated
 was
 first
 effected
 about
 
 AD
 by
 Dionysius
 Exiguus
 and
 as
 a
 basis
 for
 the
 reckoning
 of
 time
 this
 method
 has
 come
 to
 be
 known
 as
 the
 Dionysian
 system
 and
 takes
 for
 its
 fundamental
 datum
 AUC
 
 that
 is
 to
 say
 
 years
 after
 the
 founding
 of
 Rome
 as
 the
 year
 of
 our
 Lords
 birth
 So
 far
 as
 there
 exists
 any
 consensus
 of
 opinion
 among
 later
 scholars
 who
 have
 investigated
 the
 subject
 it
 is
 to
 the
 effect
 that
 the
 Dionysian
 calculation
 is
 wrong
 in
 that
 it
 places
 the
 birth
 of
 Christ
 between
 three
 and
 four
 years
 too
 late
 and
 that
 therefore
 our
 Lord
 was
 born
 in
 the
 third
 or
 fourth
 year
 before
 the
 beginning
 of
 what
 is
 designated
 by
 the
 scholars
 of
 Oxford
 and
 Cambridge
 the
 Common
 Account
 called
 Anno
 Domini
 Without
 attempting
 to
 analyze
 the
 mass
 of
 calculation
 data
 relating
 to
 this
 subject
 we
 accept
 the
 Dionysian
 basis
 as
 correct
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 year
 which
 is
 to
 say
 that
 we
 believe
 Christ
 to
 have
 been
 born
 in
 the
 year
 known
 to
 us
 as
 BC
 
 and
 as
 shall
 be
 shown
 in
 an
 early
 month
 of
 that
 year
 In
 support
 of
 this
 belief
 we
 cite
 the
 inspired
 record
 known
 as
 the
 Revelation
 on
 Church
 Government
 given
 through
 Joseph
 the
 Prophet
 in
 April
 
 which
 opens
 with
 these
 words
 The
 rise
 of
 the
 Church
 of
 Christ
 in
 these
 last
 days
 being
 one
 thousand
 eight
 hundred
 and
 thirty
 years
 since
 the
 coming
 of
 our
 Lord
 and
 Saviour
 Jesus
 Christ
 in
 the
 flesh
 Another
 evidence
 of
 the
 correctness
 of
 our
 commonly
 accepted
 chronology
 is
 furnished
 by
 the
 Book
 of
 Mormon
 record
 Therein
 we
 read
 that
 in
 the
 commencement
 of
 the
 first
 year
 of
 the
 reign
 of
 Zedekiah
 king
 of
 Judah
 the
 word
 of
 the
 Lord
 came
 to
 Lehi
 at
 Jerusalem
 directing
 him
 to
 take
 his
 family
 and
 depart
 into
 the
 wilderness
 In
 the
 early
 stages
 of
 their
 journey
 toward
 the
 sea
 Lehi
 prophesied
 as
 had
 been
 shown
 him
 of
 the
 Lord
 concerning
 the
 impending
 destruction
 of
 Jerusalem
 and
 the
 captivity
 of
 the
 Jews
 Furthermore
 he
 predicted
 the
 eventual
 return
 of
 the
 people
 of
 Judah
 from
 their
 exile
 in
 Babylon
 and
 the
 birth
 of
 the
 Messiah
 which
 latter
 event
 he
 definitely
 declared
 would
 take
 place
 six
 hundred
 years
 from
 the
 time
 he
 and
 his
 people
 had
 left
 Jerusalem
 This
 specification
 of
 time
 was
 repeated
 by
 later
 prophecy
 and
 the
 signs
 of
 the
 actual
 fulfilment
 are
 recorded
 as
 having
 been
 realized
 six
 hundred
 years
 from
 the
 time
 that
 Lehi
 left
 Jerusalem
 These
 scriptures
 fix
 the
 time
 of
 the
 beginning
 of
 Zedekiahs
 reign
 as
 six
 hundred
 years
 before
 the
 birth
 of
 Christ
 According
 to
 the
 commonly
 accepted
 reckoning
 Zedekiah
 was
 made
 king
 in
 the
 year
 
 BC
 This
 shows
 a
 discrepancy
 of
 about
 three
 years
 between
 the
 commonly
 accepted
 date
 of
 Zedekiahs
 inauguration
 as
 king
 and
 that
 given
 in
 the
 Book
 of
 Mormon
 statement
 and
 as
 already
 seen
 there
 is
 a
 difference
 of
 between
 three
 and
 four
 years
 between
 the
 Dionysian
 reckoning
 and
 the
 nearest
 approach
 to
 an
 agreement
 among
 scholars
 concerning
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 current
 era
 Book
 of
 Mormon
 chronology
 therefore
 sustains
 in
 general
 the
 correctness
 of
 the
 common
 or
 Dionysian
 system
 As
 to
 the
 season
 of
 the
 year
 in
 which
 Christ
 was
 born
 there
 is
 among
 the
 learned
 as
 great
 a
 diversity
 of
 opinion
 as
 that
 relating
 to
 the
 year
 itself
 It
 is
 claimed
 by
 many
 Biblical
 scholars
 that
 December
 th
 the
 day
 celebrated
 in
 Christendom
 as
 Christmas
 cannot
 be
 the
 correct
 date
 We
 believe
 April
 th
 to
 be
 the
 birthday
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 as
 indicated
 in
 a
 revelation
 of
 the
 present
 dispensation
 already
 cited
 in
 which
 that
 day
 is
 made
 without
 qualification
 the
 completion
 of
 the
 one
 thousand
 eight
 hundred
 and
 thirtieth
 year
 since
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Lord
 in
 the
 flesh
 This
 acceptance
 is
 admittedly
 based
 on
 faith
 in
 modern
 revelation
 and
 in
 no
 wise
 is
 set
 forth
 as
 the
 result
 of
 chronological
 research
 or
 analysis
 We
 believe
 that
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 born
 in
 Bethlehem
 of
 Judea
 April
 
 BC
 
 NOTES
 TO
 CHAPTER
 
 
 The
 TaxingRegarding
 the
 presence
 of
 Joseph
 and
 Mary
 in
 Bethlehem
 far
 from
 their
 Galilean
 home
 and
 the
 imperial
 decree
 by
 compliance
 with
 which
 they
 were
 led
 there
 the
 following
 notes
 are
 worthy
 of
 consideration
 Farrar
 Life
 of
 Christ
 p
 
 note
 says
 It
 appears
 to
 be
 uncertain
 whether
 the
 journey
 of
 Mary
 with
 her
 husband
 was
 obligatory
 or
 voluntary
 Women
 were
 liable
 to
 a
 capitation
 tax
 if
 this
 enrolment
 also
 involved
 taxation
 But
 apart
 from
 any
 legal
 necessity
 it
 may
 easily
 be
 imagined
 that
 at
 such
 a
 moment
 Mary
 would
 desire
 not
 to
 be
 left
 alone
 The
 cruel
 suspicion
 of
 which
 she
 had
 been
 the
 subject
 and
 which
 had
 almost
 led
 to
 the
 breaking
 off
 of
 her
 betrothal
 Matt
 
 would
 make
 her
 cling
 all
 the
 more
 to
 the
 protection
 of
 her
 husband
 The
 following
 excerpt
 is
 from
 Geikies
 Life
 and
 Words
 of
 Christ
 vol
 
 chap
 
 p
 
 The
 Jewish
 nation
 had
 paid
 tribute
 to
 Rome
 through
 their
 rulers
 since
 the
 days
 of
 Pompey
 and
 the
 methodical
 Augustus
 who
 now
 reigned
 and
 had
 to
 restore
 order
 and
 soundness
 to
 the
 finances
 of
 the
 empire
 after
 the
 confusion
 and
 exhaustion
 of
 the
 civil
 wars
 took
 good
 care
 that
 this
 obligation
 should
 neither
 be
 forgotten
 nor
 evaded
 He
 was
 accustomed
 to
 require
 a
 census
 to
 be
 taken
 periodically
 in
 every
 province
 of
 his
 vast
 dominions
 that
 he
 might
 know
 the
 number
 of
 soldiers
 he
 could
 levy
 in
 each
 and
 the
 amount
 of
 taxes
 due
 to
 the
 treasury
 In
 an
 empire
 embracing
 the
 then
 known
 world
 such
 a
 census
 could
 hardly
 have
 been
 made
 simultaneously
 or
 in
 any
 short
 or
 fixed
 time
 more
 probably
 it
 was
 the
 work
 of
 years
 in
 successive
 provinces
 or
 kingdoms
 Sooner
 or
 later
 however
 even
 the
 dominions
 of
 vassal
 kings
 like
 Herod
 had
 to
 furnish
 the
 statistics
 demanded
 by
 their
 master
 He
 had
 received
 his
 kingdom
 on
 the
 footing
 of
 a
 subject
 and
 grew
 more
 entirely
 dependent
 on
 Augustus
 as
 years
 passed
 asking
 his
 sanction
 at
 every
 turn
 for
 steps
 he
 proposed
 to
 take
 He
 would
 thus
 be
 only
 too
 ready
 to
 meet
 his
 wish
 by
 obtaining
 the
 statistics
 he
 sought
 as
 may
 be
 judged
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 in
 one
 of
 the
 last
 years
 of
 his
 life
 just
 before
 Christs
 birth
 he
 made
 the
 whole
 Jewish
 nation
 take
 a
 solemn
 oath
 of
 allegiance
 to
 the
 emperor
 as
 well
 as
 to
 himself
 It
 is
 quite
 probable
 that
 the
 mode
 of
 taking
 the
 required
 statistics
 was
 left
 very
 much
 to
 Herod
 at
 once
 to
 show
 respect
 to
 him
 before
 his
 people
 and
 from
 the
 known
 opposition
 of
 the
 Jews
 to
 anything
 like
 a
 general
 numeration
 even
 apart
 from
 the
 taxation
 to
 which
 it
 was
 designed
 to
 lead
 At
 the
 time
 to
 which
 the
 narrative
 refers
 a
 simple
 registration
 seems
 to
 have
 been
 made
 on
 the
 old
 Hebrew
 plan
 of
 enrolling
 by
 families
 in
 their
 ancestral
 districts
 of
 course
 for
 future
 use
 and
 thus
 it
 passed
 over
 quietly
 The
 proclamation
 having
 been
 made
 through
 the
 land
 Joseph
 had
 no
 choice
 but
 to
 go
 to
 Bethlehem
 the
 city
 of
 David
 the
 place
 in
 which
 his
 family
 descent
 from
 the
 house
 and
 lineage
 of
 David
 required
 him
 to
 be
 inscribed
 
 Jesus
 Born
 Amidst
 Poor
 SurroundingsUndoubtedly
 the
 accommodations
 for
 physical
 comfort
 amidst
 which
 Jesus
 was
 born
 were
 few
 and
 poor
 But
 the
 environment
 considered
 in
 the
 light
 of
 the
 customs
 of
 the
 country
 and
 time
 was
 far
 from
 the
 state
 of
 abject
 deprivation
 which
 modern
 and
 western
 ways
 would
 make
 it
 appear
 Camping
 out
 was
 no
 unusual
 exigency
 among
 travelers
 in
 Palestine
 at
 the
 time
 of
 our
 Lords
 birth
 nor
 is
 it
 considered
 such
 today
 It
 is
 however
 beyond
 question
 that
 Jesus
 was
 born
 into
 a
 comparatively
 poor
 family
 amidst
 humble
 surroundings
 associated
 with
 the
 inconveniences
 incident
 to
 travel
 Cunningham
 Geikie
 Life
 and

 says
 It
 was
 to
 Bethlehem
 that
 Joseph
 and
 Mary
 were
 coming
 the
 town
 of
 Ruth
 and
 Boaz
 and
 the
 early
 home
 of
 their
 own
 great
 forefather
 David
 As
 they
 approached
 it
 from
 Jerusalem
 they
 would
 pass
 at
 the
 last
 mile
 a
 spot
 sacred
 to
 Jewish
 memory
 where
 the
 light
 of
 Jacobs
 life
 went
 out
 when
 his
 first
 love
 Rachel
 died
 and
 was
 buried
 as
 her
 tomb
 still
 shows
 in
 the
 way
 to
 Ephrath
 which
 is
 Bethlehem
 
 Traveling
 in
 the
 East
 has
 always
 been
 very
 different
 from
 Western
 ideas
 As
 in
 all
 thinlysettled
 countries
 private
 hospitality
 in
 early
 times
 supplied
 the
 want
 of
 inns
 but
 it
 was
 the
 peculiarity
 of
 the
 East
 that
 this
 friendly
 custom
 continued
 through
 a
 long
 series
 of
 ages
 On
 the
 great
 roads
 through
 barren
 or
 uninhabited
 parts
 the
 need
 of
 shelter
 led
 very
 early
 to
 the
 erection
 of
 rude
 and
 simple
 buildings
 of
 varying
 size
 known
 as
 khans
 which
 offered
 the
 wayfarer
 the
 protection
 of
 walls
 and
 a
 roof
 and
 water
 but
 little
 more
 The
 smaller
 structures
 consisted
 of
 sometimes
 only
 a
 single
 empty
 room
 on
 the
 floor
 of
 which
 the
 traveler
 might
 spread
 his
 carpet
 for
 sleep
 the
 larger
 ones
 always
 built
 in
 a
 hollow
 square
 enclosing
 a
 court
 for
 the
 beasts
 with
 water
 in
 it
 for
 them
 and
 their
 masters
 From
 immemorial
 antiquity
 it
 has
 been
 a
 favorite
 mode
 of
 benevolence
 to
 raise
 such
 places
 of
 shelter
 as
 we
 see
 so
 far
 back
 as
 the
 times
 of
 David
 when
 Chimham
 built
 a
 great
 khan
 near
 Bethlehem
 on
 the
 caravan
 road
 to
 Egypt
 Canon
 Farrar
 Life
 of
 Christ
 chap
 
 accepts
 the
 traditional
 belief
 that
 the
 shelter
 within
 which
 Jesus
 was
 born
 was
 that
 of
 one
 of
 the
 numerous
 limestone
 caves
 which
 abound
 in
 the
 region
 and
 which
 are
 still
 used
 by
 travelers
 as
 resting
 places
 He
 says
 In
 Palestine
 it
 not
 infrequently
 happens
 that
 the
 entire
 khan
 or
 at
 any
 rate
 the
 portion
 of
 it
 in
 which
 the
 animals
 are
 housed
 is
 one
 of
 those
 innumerable
 caves
 which
 abound
 in
 the
 limestone
 rocks
 of
 its
 central
 hills
 Such
 seems
 to
 have
 been
 in
 the
 case
 at
 the
 little
 town
 of
 BethlehemEphratah
 in
 the
 land
 of
 Judah
 Justin
 Martyr
 the
 Apologist
 who
 from
 his
 birth
 at
 Shechem
 was
 familiar
 with
 Palestine
 and
 who
 lived
 less
 than
 a
 century
 after
 the
 time
 of
 our
 Lord
 places
 the
 scene
 of
 the
 nativity
 in
 a
 cave
 This
 is
 indeed
 the
 ancient
 and
 constant
 tradition
 both
 of
 the
 Eastern
 and
 the
 Western
 Churches
 and
 it
 is
 one
 of
 the
 few
 to
 which
 though
 unrecorded
 in
 the
 Gospel
 history
 we
 may
 attach
 a
 reasonable
 probability
 
 Herod
 the
 GreatThe
 history
 of
 Herod
 I
 otherwise
 known
 as
 Herod
 the
 Great
 must
 be
 sought
 in
 special
 works
 in
 which
 the
 subject
 is
 treated
 at
 length
 Some
 of
 the
 principal
 facts
 should
 be
 considered
 in
 our
 present
 study
 and
 for
 the
 assistance
 of
 the
 student
 a
 few
 extracts
 from
 works
 regarded
 as
 reliable
 are
 presented
 herewith
 Condensed

 Herod
 I
 the
 son
 of
 Antipater
 was
 early
 given
 office
 by
 his
 father
 who
 had
 been
 made
 procurator
 of
 Judea
 The
 first
 office
 which
 Herod
 held
 was
 that
 of
 governor
 of
 Galilee
 He
 was
 then
 a
 young
 man
 of
 about
 twentyfive
 energetic
 and
 athletic
 Immediately
 he
 set
 about
 the
 eradication
 of
 the
 robber
 bands
 that
 infested
 his
 district
 and
 soon
 was
 able
 to
 execute
 the
 robber
 chief
 Hezekiah
 and
 several
 of
 his
 followers
 For
 this
 he
 was
 summoned
 to
 Jerusalem
 by
 the
 Sanhedrin
 tried
 and
 condemned
 but
 with
 the
 connivance
 of
 Hyrcanus
 II
 the
 high
 priest
 and
 ethnarch
 he
 escaped
 by
 nightHe
 went
 to
 Rome
 where
 he
 was
 appointed
 King
 of
 Judea
 by
 Antony
 and
 OctaviusFor
 the
 next
 two
 years
 he
 was
 engaged
 in
 fighting
 the
 forces
 of
 Antigonus
 whom
 he
 finally
 defeated
 and
 in
 
 BC
 gained
 possession
 of
 JerusalemAs
 king
 Herod
 confronted
 serious
 difficulties
 The
 Jews
 objected
 to
 him
 because
 of
 his
 birth
 and
 reputation
 The
 Asmonean
 family
 regarded
 him
 as
 a
 usurper
 notwithstanding
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 had
 married
 Mariamne
 The
 Pharisees
 were
 shocked
 at
 his
 Hellenistic
 sympathies
 as
 well
 as
 at
 his
 severe
 methods
 of
 government
 On
 the
 other
 hand
 the
 Romans
 held
 him
 responsible
 for
 the
 order
 of
 his
 kingdom
 and
 the
 protection
 of
 the
 eastern
 frontier
 of
 the
 Republic
 Herod
 met
 these
 various
 difficulties
 with
 characteristic
 energy
 and
 even
 cruelty
 and
 generally
 with
 cold
 sagacity
 Although
 he
 taxed
 the
 people
 severely
 in
 times
 of
 famine
 he
 remitted
 their
 dues
 and
 even
 sold
 his
 plate
 to
 get
 means
 to
 buy
 them
 food
 While
 he
 never
 became
 actually
 friendly
 with
 the
 Pharisees
 they
 profited
 by
 his
 hostility
 to
 the
 party
 of
 the
 Asmoneans
 which
 led
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 his
 reign
 to
 the
 execution
 of
 a
 number
 of
 Sadducees
 who
 were
 members
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 From
 Smiths
 Comprehensive
 Dictionary
 of
 the
 Bible
 The
 latter
 part
 of
 the
 reign
 of
 Herod
 was
 undisturbed
 by
 external
 troubles
 but
 his
 domestic
 life
 was
 embittered
 by
 an
 almost
 uninterrupted
 series
 of
 injuries
 and
 cruel
 acts
 of
 vengeance
 The
 terrible
 acts
 of
 bloodshed
 which
 Herod
 perpetrated
 in
 his
 own
 family
 were
 accompanied
 by
 others
 among
 his
 subjects
 equally
 terrible
 from
 the
 number
 who
 fell
 victims
 to
 them
 According
 to
 the
 wellknown
 story
 he
 ordered
 the
 nobles
 whom
 he
 had
 called
 to
 him
 in
 his
 last
 moments
 to
 be
 executed
 immediately
 after
 his
 decease
 that
 so
 at
 least
 his
 death
 might
 be
 attended
 by
 universal
 mourning
 It
 was
 at
 the
 time
 of
 his
 fatal
 illness
 that
 he
 must
 have
 caused
 the
 slaughter
 of
 the
 infants
 at
 Bethlehem
 Matt
 
 The
 mortal
 end
 of
 the
 tyrant
 and
 multimurderer
 is
 thus
 treated
 by
 Farrar
 in
 his
 Life
 of
 Christ
 pp
 
 It
 must
 have
 been
 very
 shortly
 after
 the
 murder
 of
 the
 innocents
 that
 Herod
 died
 Only
 five
 days
 before
 his
 death
 he
 had
 made
 a
 frantic
 attempt
 at
 suicide
 and
 had
 ordered
 the
 execution
 of
 his
 eldest
 son
 Antipater
 His
 deathbed
 which
 once
 more
 reminds
 us
 of
 Henry
 VIII
 was
 accompanied
 by
 circumstances
 of
 peculiar
 horror
 and
 it
 has
 been
 asserted
 that
 he
 died
 of
 a
 loathsome
 disease
 which
 is
 hardly
 mentioned
 in
 history
 except
 in
 the
 case
 of
 men
 who
 have
 been
 rendered
 infamous
 by
 an
 atrocity
 of
 persecuting
 zeal
 On
 his
 bed
 of
 intolerable
 anguish
 in
 that
 splendid
 and
 luxurious
 palace
 which
 he
 had
 built
 for
 himself
 under
 the
 palms
 of
 Jericho
 swollen
 with
 disease
 and
 scorched
 by
 thirst
 ulcerated
 externally
 and
 glowing
 inwardly
 with
 a
 soft
 slow
 fire
 surrounded
 by
 plotting
 sons
 and
 plundering
 slaves
 detesting
 all
 and
 detested
 by
 all
 longing
 for
 death
 as
 a
 release
 from
 his
 tortures
 yet
 dreading
 it
 as
 the
 beginning
 of
 worse
 terrors
 stung
 by
 remorse
 yet
 still
 unslaked
 with
 murder
 a
 horror
 to
 all
 around
 him
 yet
 in
 his
 guilty
 conscience
 a
 worse
 terror
 to
 himself
 devoured
 by
 the
 premature
 corruption
 of
 an
 anticipated
 grave
 eaten
 of
 worms
 as
 though
 visibly
 smitten
 by
 the
 finger
 of
 Gods
 wrath
 after
 seventy
 years
 of
 successful
 villainy
 the
 wretched
 old
 man
 whom
 men
 had
 called
 the
 Great
 lay
 in
 savage
 frenzy
 awaiting
 his
 last
 hour
 As
 he
 knew
 that
 none
 would
 shed
 one
 tear
 for
 him
 he
 determined
 that
 they
 should
 shed
 many
 for
 themselves
 and
 issued
 an
 order
 that
 under
 pain
 of
 death
 the
 principal
 families
 of
 the
 kingdom
 and
 the
 chiefs
 of
 the
 tribes
 should
 come
 to
 Jericho
 They
 came
 and
 then
 shutting
 them
 in
 the
 hippodrome
 he
 secretly
 commanded
 his
 sister
 Salome
 that
 at
 the
 moment
 of
 his
 death
 they
 should
 all
 be
 massacred
 And
 so
 choking
 as
 it
 were
 with
 blood
 devising
 massacres
 in
 its
 very
 delirium
 the
 soul
 of
 Herod
 passed
 forth
 into
 the
 night

 Gifts
 from
 the
 Wise
 Men
 to
 the
 Child
 JesusThe
 scriptural
 account
 of
 the
 visit
 of
 the
 wise
 men
 to
 Jesus
 and
 His
 mother
 states
 that
 they
 fell
 down
 and
 worshipped
 him
 and
 furthermore
 that
 when
 they
 had
 opened
 their
 treasures
 they
 presented
 unto
 him
 gifts
 gold
 and
 frankincense
 and
 myrrh
 The
 offering
 of
 gifts
 to
 a
 superior
 in
 rank
 either
 as
 to
 worldly
 status
 or
 recognized
 spiritual
 endowment
 was
 a
 custom
 of
 early
 days
 and
 still
 prevails
 in
 many
 oriental
 lands
 It
 is
 worthy
 of
 note
 that
 we
 have
 no
 record
 of
 these
 men
 from
 the
 east
 offering
 gifts
 to
 Herod
 in
 his
 palace
 they
 did
 however
 impart
 of
 their
 treasure
 to
 the
 lowly
 Infant
 in
 whom
 they
 recognized
 the
 King
 they
 had
 come
 to
 seek
 The
 tendency
 to
 ascribe
 occult
 significance
 to
 even
 trifling
 details
 mentioned
 in
 scripture
 and
 particularly
 as
 regards
 the
 life
 of
 Christ
 has
 led
 to
 many
 fanciful
 suggestions
 concerning
 the
 gold
 and
 frankincense
 and
 myrrh
 specified
 in
 this
 incident
 Some
 have
 supposed
 a
 halfhidden
 symbolism
 thereingold
 a
 tribute
 to
 His
 royal
 estate
 frankincense
 an
 offering
 in
 recognition
 of
 His
 priesthood
 and
 myrrh
 for
 His
 burial
 The
 sacred
 record
 offers
 no
 basis
 for
 such
 conjecture
 Myrrh
 and
 frankincense
 are
 aromatic
 resins
 derived
 from
 plants
 indigenous
 to
 eastern
 lands
 and
 they
 have
 been
 used
 from
 very
 early
 times
 in
 medicine
 and
 in
 the
 preparation
 of
 perfumes
 and
 incense
 mixtures
 They
 were
 presumably
 among
 the
 natural
 productions
 of
 the
 lands
 from
 which
 the
 magi
 came
 though
 probably
 even
 there
 they
 were
 costly
 and
 highly
 esteemed
 Such
 together
 with
 gold
 which
 is
 of
 value
 among
 all
 nations
 were
 most
 appropriate
 as
 gifts
 for
 a
 king
 Any
 mystical
 significance
 one
 may
 choose
 to
 attach
 to
 the
 presents
 must
 be
 remembered
 as
 his
 own
 supposition
 or
 fancy
 and
 not
 as
 based
 on
 scriptural
 warrant
 
 Testimonies
 from
 Shepherds
 and
 MagiThe
 following
 instructive
 note
 on
 the
 testimonies
 relating
 to
 Messiahs
 birth
 is
 taken
 from
 the
 Young
 Mens
 Mutual
 Improvement
 Association
 Manual
 for
 
 It
 will
 be
 observed
 that
 the
 testimonies
 concerning
 the
 birth
 of
 the
 Messiah
 are
 from
 two
 extremes
 the
 lowly
 shepherds
 in
 the
 Judean
 field
 and
 the
 learned
 magi
 from
 the
 far
 east
 We
 cannot
 think
 this
 is
 the
 result
 of
 mere
 chance
 but
 that
 in
 it
 may
 be
 discerned
 the
 purpose
 and
 wisdom
 of
 God
 All
 Israel
 was
 looking
 forward
 to
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Messiah
 and
 in
 the
 birth
 of
 Jesus
 at
 Bethlehem
 the
 hope
 of
 Israelthough
 unknown
 to
 Israelis
 fulfilled
 Messiah
 of
 whom
 the
 prophet
 spake
 is
 born
 But
 there
 must
 be
 those
 who
 can
 testify
 of
 that
 truth
 and
 hence
 to
 the
 shepherds
 who
 watched
 their
 flocks
 by
 night
 an
 angel
 was
 sent
 to
 say
 Fear
 not
 behold
 I
 bring
 you
 good
 tidings
 of
 great
 joy
 which
 shall
 be
 to
 all
 people
 for
 unto
 you
 is
 born
 this
 day
 in
 the
 city
 of
 David
 a
 Saviour
 which
 is
 Christ
 the
 Lord
 And
 for
 a
 sign
 of
 the
 truth
 of
 the
 message
 they
 were
 to
 find
 the
 child
 wrapped
 in
 swaddling
 clothes
 lying
 in
 a
 manger
 in
 Bethlehem
 And
 they
 went
 with
 haste
 and
 found
 Mary
 and
 Joseph
 and
 the
 babe
 lying
 in
 a
 manger
 and
 when
 they
 had
 seen
 it
 they
 made
 known
 abroad
 the
 saying
 which
 was
 told
 them
 concerning
 this
 child
 God
 had
 raised
 up
 to
 Himself
 witnesses
 among
 the
 people
 to
 testify
 that
 Messiah
 was
 born
 that
 the
 hope
 of
 Israel
 was
 fulfilled
 But
 there
 were
 classes
 of
 people
 among
 the
 Jews
 whom
 these
 lowly
 shepherd
 witnesses
 could
 not
 reach
 and
 had
 they
 been
 able
 to
 reach
 them
 the
 story
 of
 the
 angels
 visit
 and
 the
 concourse
 of
 angels
 singing
 the
 magnificent
 song
 of
 Peace
 on
 earth
 good
 will
 to
 men
 would
 doubtless
 have
 been
 accounted
 an
 idle
 tale
 of
 superstitious
 folk
 deceived
 by
 their
 own
 overwrought
 imaginations
 or
 idle
 dreams
 Hence
 God
 raised
 up
 another
 class
 of
 witnessesthe
 wise
 men
 from
 the
 eastwitnesses
 that
 could
 enter
 the
 royal
 palace
 of
 proud
 King
 Herod
 and
 boldly
 ask
 Where
 is
 he
 that
 is
 born
 king
 of
 the
 Jews
 for
 we
 have
 seen
 his
 star
 in
 the
 east
 and
 are
 come
 to
 worship
 him
 a
 testimony
 that
 startled
 Herod
 and
 troubled
 all
 Jerusalem
 So
 that
 indeed
 God
 raised
 up
 witnesses
 for
 Himself
 to
 meet
 all
 classes
 and
 conditions
 of
 menthe
 testimony
 of
 angels
 for
 the
 poor
 and
 the
 lowly
 the
 testimony
 of
 wise
 men
 for
 the
 haughty
 king
 and
 proud
 priests
 of
 Judea
 So
 that
 of
 the
 things
 concerning
 the
 birth
 of
 Messiah
 no
 less
 than
 of
 the
 things
 of
 His
 death
 and
 resurrection
 from
 the
 dead
 His
 disciples
 could
 say
 these
 things
 were
 not
 done
 in
 a
 corner

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 BOY
 OF
 NAZARETH
 Joseph
 Mary
 and
 her
 Son
 remained
 in
 Egypt
 until
 after
 the
 death
 of
 Herod
 the
 Great
 which
 event
 was
 made
 known
 by
 another
 angelic
 visitation
 Their
 stay
 in
 the
 foreign
 land
 was
 probably
 brief
 for
 Herod
 did
 not
 long
 survive
 the
 babes
 he
 had
 slain
 in
 Bethlehem
 In
 the
 return
 of
 the
 family
 from
 Egypt
 the
 evangelist
 finds
 a
 fulfilment
 of
 Hoseas
 prophetic
 vision
 of
 what
 should
 be
 Out
 of
 Egypt
 have
 I
 called
 my
 son
 It
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 Josephs
 intention
 to
 make
 a
 home
 for
 the
 family
 in
 Judea
 possibly
 at
 Bethlehemthe
 city
 of
 his
 ancestors
 and
 a
 place
 now
 even
 more
 endeared
 to
 him
 as
 the
 birthplace
 of
 Marys
 Childbut
 learning
 on
 the
 way
 that
 Herods
 son
 Archelaus
 ruled
 in
 the
 place
 of
 his
 wicked
 father
 Joseph
 modified
 his
 purpose
 and
 being
 warned
 of
 God
 in
 a
 dream
 he
 turned
 aside
 into
 the
 parts
 of
 Galilee
 and
 he
 came
 and
 dwelt
 in
 a
 city
 called
 Nazareth
 that
 it
 might
 be
 fulfilled
 which
 was
 spoken
 by
 the
 prophets
 He
 shall
 be
 called
 a
 Nazarene
 While
 Archelaus
 who
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 a
 natural
 heir
 to
 his
 infamous
 fathers
 wickedness
 and
 cruelty
 ruled
 in
 Judea
 for
 a
 short
 time
 as
 king
 then
 with
 the
 less
 exalted
 title
 of
 ethnarch
 which
 had
 been
 decreed
 to
 him
 by
 the
 emperor
 his
 brother
 Antipas
 governed
 as
 tetrarch
 in
 Galilee
 Herod
 Antipas
 was
 well
 nigh
 as
 vicious
 and
 reprobate
 as
 others
 of
 his
 unprincipled
 family
 but
 he
 was
 less
 aggressive
 in
 vindictiveness
 and
 in
 that
 period
 of
 his
 reign
 was
 comparatively
 tolerant
 Concerning
 the
 home
 life
 of
 Joseph
 and
 his
 family
 in
 Nazareth
 the
 scriptural
 record
 makes
 but
 brief
 mention
 The
 silence
 with
 which
 the
 early
 period
 of
 the
 life
 of
 Jesus
 is
 treated
 by
 the
 inspired
 historians
 is
 impressive
 while
 the
 fanciful
 accounts
 written
 in
 later
 years
 by
 unauthorized
 hands
 are
 full
 of
 fictitious
 detail
 much
 of
 which
 is
 positively
 revolting
 in
 its
 puerile
 inconsistency
 None
 but
 Joseph
 Mary
 and
 the
 other
 members
 of
 the
 immediate
 family
 or
 close
 associates
 of
 the
 household
 could
 have
 furnished
 the
 facts
 of
 daily
 life
 in
 the
 humble
 home
 at
 Nazareth
 and
 from
 these
 qualified
 informants
 Matthew
 and
 Luke
 probably
 derived
 the
 knowledge
 of
 which
 they
 wrote
 The
 record
 made
 by
 those
 who
 knew
 is
 marked
 by
 impressive
 brevity
 In
 this
 absence
 of
 detail
 we
 may
 see
 evidence
 of
 the
 genuineness
 of
 the
 scriptural
 account
 Inventive
 writers
 would
 have
 supplied
 as
 later
 such
 did
 supply
 what
 we
 seek
 in
 vain
 within
 the
 chapters
 of
 the
 Gospels
 With
 hallowed
 silence
 do
 the
 inspired
 scribes
 honor
 the
 boyhood
 of
 their
 Lord
 he
 who
 seeks
 to
 invent
 circumstances
 and
 to
 invest
 the
 life
 of
 Christ
 with
 fictitious
 additions
 dishonors
 Him
 Read
 thoughtfully
 the
 attested
 truth
 concerning
 the
 childhood
 of
 the
 Christ
 And
 the
 child
 grew
 and
 waxed
 strong
 in
 spirit
 filled
 with
 wisdom
 and
 the
 grace
 of
 God
 was
 upon
 him
 In
 such
 simplicity
 is
 the
 normal
 natural
 development
 of
 the
 Boy
 Jesus
 made
 clear
 He
 came
 among
 men
 to
 experience
 all
 the
 natural
 conditions
 of
 mortality
 He
 was
 born
 as
 truly
 a
 dependent
 helpless
 babe
 as
 is
 any
 other
 child
 His
 infancy
 was
 in
 all
 common
 features
 as
 the
 infancy
 of
 others
 His
 boyhood
 was
 actual
 boyhood
 His
 development
 was
 as
 necessary
 and
 as
 real
 as
 that
 of
 all
 children
 Over
 His
 mind
 had
 fallen
 the
 veil
 of
 forgetfulness
 common
 to
 all
 who
 are
 born
 to
 earth
 by
 which
 the
 remembrance
 of
 primeval
 existence
 is
 shut
 off
 The
 Child
 grew
 and
 with
 growth
 there
 came
 to
 Him
 expansion
 of
 mind
 development
 of
 faculties
 and
 progression
 in
 power
 and
 understanding
 His
 advancement
 was
 from
 one
 grace
 to
 another
 not
 from
 gracelessness
 to
 grace
 from
 good
 to
 greater
 good
 not
 from
 evil
 to
 good
 from
 favor
 with
 God
 to
 greater
 favor
 not
 from
 estrangement
 because
 of
 sin
 to
 reconciliation
 through
 repentance
 and
 propitiation
 Our
 knowledge
 of
 Jewish
 life
 in
 that
 age
 justifies
 the
 inference
 that
 the
 Boy
 was
 well
 taught
 in
 the
 law
 and
 the
 scriptures
 for
 such
 was
 the
 rule
 He
 garnered
 knowledge
 by
 study
 and
 gained
 wisdom
 by
 prayer
 thought
 and
 effort
 Beyond
 question
 He
 was
 trained
 to
 labor
 for
 idleness
 was
 abhorred
 then
 as
 it
 is
 now
 and
 every
 Jewish
 boy
 whether
 carpenters
 son
 peasants
 child
 or
 rabbis
 heir
 was
 required
 to
 learn
 and
 follow
 a
 practical
 and
 productive
 vocation
 Jesus
 was
 all
 that
 a
 boy
 should
 be
 for
 His
 development
 was
 unretarded
 by
 the
 dragging
 weight
 of
 sin
 He
 loved
 and
 obeyed
 the
 truth
 and
 therefore
 was
 free
 Joseph
 and
 Mary
 devout
 and
 faithful
 in
 all
 observances
 of
 the
 law
 went
 up
 to
 Jerusalem
 every
 year
 at
 the
 feast
 of
 the
 Passover
 This
 religious
 festival
 it
 should
 be
 remembered
 was
 one
 of
 the
 most
 solemn
 and
 sacred
 among
 the
 many
 ceremonial
 commemorations
 of
 the
 Jews
 it
 had
 been
 established
 at
 the
 time
 of
 the
 peoples
 exodus
 from
 Egypt
 in
 remembrance
 of
 the
 outstretched
 arm
 of
 power
 by
 which
 God
 had
 delivered
 Israel
 after
 the
 angel
 of
 destruction
 had
 slain
 the
 firstborn
 in
 every
 Egyptian
 home
 and
 had
 mercifully
 passed
 over
 the
 houses
 of
 the
 children
 of
 Jacob
 It
 was
 of
 such
 importance
 that
 its
 annual
 recurrence
 was
 made
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 new
 year
 The
 law
 required
 all
 males
 to
 present
 themselves
 before
 the
 Lord
 at
 the
 feast
 The
 rule
 was
 that
 women
 should
 likewise
 attend
 if
 not
 lawfully
 detained
 and
 Mary
 appears
 to
 have
 followed
 both
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 law
 and
 the
 letter
 of
 the
 rule
 for
 she
 habitually
 accompanied
 her
 husband
 to
 the
 annual
 gathering
 at
 Jerusalem
 When
 Jesus
 had
 attained
 the
 age
 of
 twelve
 years
 He
 was
 taken
 by
 His
 mother
 and
 Joseph
 to
 the
 feast
 as
 the
 law
 required
 whether
 the
 Boy
 had
 ever
 before
 been
 present
 on
 such
 an
 occasion
 we
 are
 not
 told
 At
 twelve
 years
 of
 age
 a
 Jewish
 boy
 was
 recognized
 as
 a
 member
 of
 his
 home
 community
 he
 was
 required
 then
 to
 enter
 with
 definite
 purpose
 upon
 his
 chosen
 vocation
 he
 attained
 an
 advanced
 status
 as
 an
 individual
 in
 that
 thereafter
 he
 could
 not
 be
 arbitrarily
 disposed
 of
 as
 a
 bondservant
 by
 his
 parents
 he
 was
 appointed
 to
 higher
 studies
 in
 school
 and
 home
 and
 when
 accepted
 by
 the
 priests
 he
 became
 a
 son
 of
 the
 law
 It
 was
 the
 common
 and
 very
 natural
 desire
 of
 parents
 to
 have
 their
 sons
 attend
 the
 feast
 of
 the
 Passover
 and
 be
 present
 at
 the
 temple
 ceremonies
 as
 recognized
 members
 of
 the
 congregation
 when
 of
 the
 prescribed
 age
 Thus
 came
 the
 Boy
 Jesus
 to
 the
 temple
 The
 feast
 proper
 lasted
 seven
 days
 and
 in
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 was
 annually
 attended
 by
 great
 concourses
 of
 Jews
 Josephus
 speaks
 of
 such
 a
 Passover
 gathering
 as
 an
 innumerable
 multitude
 The
 people
 came
 from
 distant
 provinces
 in
 large
 companies
 and
 caravans
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 convenience
 and
 as
 a
 means
 of
 common
 protection
 against
 the
 marauding
 bands
 which
 are
 known
 to
 have
 infested
 the
 country
 As
 members
 of
 such
 a
 company
 Joseph
 and
 his
 family
 traveled
 When
 following
 the
 conclusion
 of
 the
 Passover
 the
 Galilean
 company
 had
 gone
 a
 days
 journey
 toward
 home
 Joseph
 and
 Mary
 discovered
 to
 their
 surprize
 and
 deep
 concern
 that
 Jesus
 was
 not
 with
 their
 company
 After
 a
 fruitless
 search
 among
 their
 friends
 and
 acquaintances
 they
 turned
 back
 toward
 Jerusalem
 seeking
 the
 Boy
 Their
 inquiries
 brought
 little
 comfort
 or
 assistance
 until
 three
 days
 had
 passed
 then
 they
 found
 him
 in
 the
 temple
 sitting
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 doctors
 both
 hearing
 them
 and
 asking
 them
 questions
 It
 was
 no
 unusual
 thing
 for
 a
 twelve
 year
 old
 boy
 to
 be
 questioned
 by
 priests
 scribes
 or
 rabbis
 nor
 to
 be
 permitted
 to
 ask
 questions
 of
 these
 professional
 expounders
 of
 the
 law
 for
 such
 procedure
 was
 part
 of
 the
 educational
 training
 of
 Jewish
 youths
 nor
 was
 there
 anything
 surprizing
 in
 such
 a
 meeting
 of
 students
 and
 teachers
 within
 the
 temple
 courts
 for
 the
 rabbis
 of
 that
 time
 were
 accustomed
 to
 give
 instruction
 there
 and
 people
 young
 and
 old
 gathered
 about
 them
 sitting
 at
 their
 feet
 to
 learn
 but
 there
 was
 much
 that
 was
 extraordinary
 in
 this
 interview
 as
 the
 demeanor
 of
 the
 learned
 doctors
 showed
 for
 never
 before
 had
 such
 a
 student
 been
 found
 inasmuch
 as
 all
 that
 heard
 him
 were
 astonished
 at
 his
 understanding
 and
 answers
 The
 incident
 furnishes
 evidence
 of
 a
 wellspent
 boyhood
 and
 proof
 of
 unusual
 attainments
 The
 amazement
 of
 Mary
 and
 her
 husband
 on
 finding
 the
 Boy
 in
 such
 distinguished
 company
 and
 so
 plainly
 the
 object
 of
 deference
 and
 respect
 and
 the
 joy
 of
 seeing
 again
 the
 beloved
 One
 who
 to
 them
 had
 been
 lost
 did
 not
 entirely
 banish
 the
 memory
 of
 the
 anguish
 His
 absence
 had
 caused
 them
 In
 words
 of
 gentle
 yet
 unmistakable
 reproof
 the
 mother
 said
 Son
 why
 hast
 thou
 thus
 dealt
 with
 us
 behold
 thy
 father
 and
 I
 have
 sought
 thee
 sorrowing
 The
 Boys
 reply
 astonished
 them
 in
 that
 it
 revealed
 to
 an
 extent
 they
 had
 not
 before
 realized
 His
 rapidly
 maturing
 powers
 of
 judgment
 and
 understanding
 Said
 He
 How
 is
 it
 that
 ye
 sought
 me
 wist
 ye
 not
 that
 I
 must
 be
 about
 my
 Fathers
 business
 Let
 us
 not
 say
 that
 there
 was
 unkind
 rebuke
 or
 unfilial
 reproof
 in
 the
 answer
 of
 this
 most
 dutiful
 of
 sons
 to
 His
 mother
 His
 reply
 was
 to
 Mary
 a
 reminder
 of
 what
 she
 seems
 to
 have
 forgotten
 for
 the
 momentthe
 facts
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 her
 Sons
 paternity
 She
 had
 used
 the
 words
 thy
 father
 and
 I
 and
 her
 Sons
 response
 had
 brought
 anew
 to
 her
 mind
 the
 truth
 that
 Joseph
 was
 not
 the
 Boys
 father
 She
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 astonished
 that
 One
 so
 young
 should
 so
 thoroughly
 understand
 His
 position
 with
 respect
 to
 herself
 He
 had
 made
 plain
 to
 her
 the
 inadvertent
 inaccuracy
 of
 her
 words
 His
 Father
 had
 not
 been
 seeking
 Him
 for
 was
 He
 not
 even
 at
 that
 moment
 in
 His
 Fathers
 house
 and
 particularly
 engaged
 in
 His
 Fathers
 business
 the
 very
 work
 to
 which
 His
 Father
 had
 appointed
 Him
 He
 had
 in
 no
 wise
 intimated
 a
 doubt
 as
 to
 Marys
 maternal
 relationship
 to
 Himself
 though
 He
 had
 indisputably
 shown
 that
 He
 recognized
 as
 His
 Father
 not
 Joseph
 of
 Nazareth
 but
 the
 God
 of
 Heaven
 Both
 Mary
 and
 Joseph
 failed
 to
 comprehend
 the
 full
 import
 of
 His
 words
 Though
 He
 understood
 the
 superior
 claim
 of
 duty
 based
 on
 His
 divine
 Sonship
 and
 had
 shown
 to
 Mary
 that
 her
 authority
 as
 earthly
 mother
 was
 subordinate
 to
 that
 of
 His
 immortal
 and
 divine
 Father
 nevertheless
 He
 obeyed
 her
 Interested
 as
 were
 the
 doctors
 in
 this
 remarkable
 Boy
 much
 as
 He
 had
 given
 them
 to
 ponder
 over
 through
 His
 searching
 questions
 and
 wise
 answers
 they
 could
 not
 detain
 Him
 for
 the
 very
 law
 they
 professed
 to
 uphold
 enjoined
 strict
 obedience
 to
 parental
 authority
 And
 he
 went
 down
 with
 them
 and
 came
 to
 Nazareth
 and
 was
 subject
 unto
 them
 but
 his
 mother
 kept
 all
 these
 sayings
 in
 her
 heart
 What
 marvelous
 and
 sacred
 secrets
 were
 treasured
 in
 that
 mothers
 heart
 and
 what
 new
 surprizes
 and
 grave
 problems
 were
 added
 day
 after
 day
 in
 the
 manifestations
 of
 unfolding
 wisdom
 displayed
 by
 her
 more
 than
 mortal
 Son
 Though
 she
 could
 never
 have
 wholly
 forgotten
 at
 times
 she
 seemingly
 lost
 sight
 of
 her
 Sons
 exalted
 personality
 That
 such
 conditions
 should
 exist
 was
 perhaps
 divinely
 appointed
 There
 could
 scarcely
 have
 been
 a
 full
 measure
 of
 truly
 human
 experience
 in
 the
 relationship
 between
 Jesus
 and
 His
 mother
 or
 between
 Him
 and
 Joseph
 had
 the
 fact
 of
 His
 divinity
 been
 always
 dominant
 or
 even
 prominently
 apparent
 Mary
 appears
 never
 to
 have
 fully
 understood
 her
 Son
 at
 every
 new
 evidence
 of
 His
 uniqueness
 she
 marveled
 and
 pondered
 anew
 He
 was
 hers
 and
 yet
 in
 a
 very
 real
 sense
 not
 wholly
 hers
 There
 was
 about
 their
 relation
 to
 each
 other
 a
 mystery
 awful
 yet
 sublime
 a
 holy
 secret
 which
 that
 chosen
 and
 blessed
 mother
 hesitated
 even
 to
 tell
 over
 to
 herself
 Fear
 must
 have
 contended
 with
 joy
 within
 her
 soul
 because
 of
 Him
 The
 memory
 of
 Gabriels
 glorious
 promises
 the
 testimony
 of
 the
 rejoicing
 shepherds
 and
 the
 adoration
 of
 the
 magi
 must
 have
 struggled
 with
 that
 of
 Simeons
 portentous
 prophecy
 directed
 to
 herself
 in
 person
 Yea
 a
 sword
 shall
 pierce
 through
 thy
 own
 soul
 also
 As
 to
 the
 events
 of
 the
 eighteen
 years
 following
 the
 return
 of
 Jesus
 from
 Jerusalem
 to
 Nazareth
 the
 scriptures
 are
 silent
 save
 for
 one
 rich
 sentence
 of
 greatest
 import
 And
 Jesus
 increased
 in
 wisdom
 and
 stature
 and
 in
 favor
 with
 God
 and
 man
 Plainly
 this
 Son
 of
 the
 Highest
 was
 not
 endowed
 with
 a
 fulness
 of
 knowledge
 nor
 with
 the
 complete
 investiture
 of
 wisdom
 from
 the
 cradle
 Slowly
 the
 assurance
 of
 His
 appointed
 mission
 as
 the
 Messiah
 of
 whose
 coming
 He
 read
 in
 the
 law
 the
 prophets
 and
 the
 psalms
 developed
 within
 His
 soul
 and
 in
 devoted
 preparation
 for
 the
 ministry
 that
 should
 find
 culmination
 on
 the
 cross
 He
 passed
 the
 years
 of
 youth
 and
 early
 manhood
 From
 the
 chronicles
 of
 later
 years
 we
 learn
 that
 He
 was
 reputed
 without
 question
 to
 be
 the
 son
 of
 Joseph
 and
 Mary
 and
 was
 regarded
 as
 the
 brother
 of
 other
 and
 younger
 children
 of
 the
 family
 He
 was
 spoken
 of
 both
 as
 a
 carpenter
 and
 a
 carpenters
 son
 and
 until
 the
 beginning
 of
 His
 public
 ministry
 He
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 of
 little
 prominence
 even
 in
 the
 small
 home
 community
 He
 lived
 the
 simple
 life
 at
 peace
 with
 His
 fellows
 in
 communion
 with
 His
 Father
 thus
 increasing
 in
 favor
 with
 God
 and
 men
 As
 shown
 by
 His
 public
 utterances
 after
 He
 had
 become
 a
 man
 these
 years
 of
 seclusion
 were
 spent
 in
 active
 effort
 both
 physical
 and
 mental
 Jesus
 was
 a
 close
 observer
 of
 nature
 and
 men
 He
 was
 able
 to
 draw
 illustrations
 with
 which
 to
 point
 His
 teachings
 from
 the
 varied
 occupations
 trades
 and
 professions
 the
 ways
 of
 the
 lawyer
 and
 the
 physician
 the
 manners
 of
 the
 scribe
 the
 Pharisee
 and
 the
 rabbi
 the
 habits
 of
 the
 poor
 the
 customs
 of
 the
 rich
 the
 life
 of
 the
 shepherd
 the
 farmer
 the
 vinedresser
 and
 the
 fishermanwere
 all
 known
 to
 Him
 He
 considered
 the
 lilies
 of
 the
 field
 and
 the
 grass
 in
 meadow
 and
 upland
 the
 birds
 which
 sowed
 not
 nor
 gathered
 into
 barns
 but
 lived
 on
 the
 bounty
 of
 their
 Maker
 the
 foxes
 in
 their
 holes
 the
 petted
 house
 dog
 and
 the
 vagrant
 cur
 the
 hen
 sheltering
 her
 brood
 beneath
 protecting
 wingsall
 these
 had
 contributed
 to
 the
 wisdom
 in
 which
 He
 grew
 as
 had
 also
 the
 moods
 of
 the
 weather
 the
 recurrence
 of
 the
 seasons
 and
 all
 the
 phenomena
 of
 natural
 change
 and
 order
 Nazareth
 was
 the
 abode
 of
 Jesus
 until
 He
 was
 about
 thirty
 years
 of
 age
 and
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 custom
 of
 designating
 individuals
 by
 the
 names
 of
 their
 home
 towns
 as
 additions
 to
 their
 personal
 names
 our
 Lord
 came
 to
 be
 generally
 known
 as
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 He
 is
 also
 referred
 to
 as
 a
 Nazarene
 or
 a
 native
 of
 Nazareth
 and
 this
 fact
 is
 cited
 by
 Matthew
 as
 a
 fulfilment
 of
 earlier
 prediction
 though
 our
 current
 compilation
 of
 scriptures
 constituting
 the
 Old
 Testament
 contains
 no
 record
 of
 such
 prophecy
 It
 is
 practically
 certain
 that
 this
 prediction
 was
 contained
 in
 some
 one
 of
 the
 many
 scriptures
 extant
 in
 earlier
 days
 but
 since
 lost
 That
 Nazareth
 was
 an
 obscure
 village
 of
 little
 honor
 or
 renown
 is
 evidenced
 by
 the
 almost
 contemptuous
 question
 of
 Nathanael
 who
 on
 being
 informed
 that
 the
 Messiah
 had
 been
 found
 in
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 asked
 Can
 there
 any
 good
 thing
 come
 out
 of
 Nazareth
 The
 incredulous
 query
 has
 passed
 into
 a
 proverb
 current
 even
 today
 as
 expressive
 of
 any
 unpopular
 or
 unpromising
 source
 of
 good
 Nathanael
 lived
 in
 Cana
 but
 a
 few
 miles
 from
 Nazareth
 and
 his
 surprize
 at
 the
 tidings
 brought
 by
 Philip
 concerning
 the
 Messiah
 incidentally
 affords
 evidence
 of
 the
 seclusion
 in
 which
 Jesus
 had
 lived
 So
 passed
 the
 boyhood
 youth
 and
 early
 manhood
 of
 the
 Savior
 of
 mankind

 growth
 of
 Jesus
 from

 maturity
 And
 I
 John
 saw
 that
 he
 received
 not
 of
 the
 fullness
 at
 the
 first
 but
 received
 grace
 for
 grace
 and
 he
 received
 not
 of
 the
 fullness
 at
 first
 but
 continued
 from
 grace
 to
 grace
 until
 he
 received
 a
 fullness
 and
 thus
 he
 was
 called
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 because
 he
 received
 not
 of
 the
 fullness
 at
 the
 first

 Notwithstanding
 this
 graded
 course
 of
 growth
 and
 development
 after
 His
 birth
 in
 the
 flesh
 Jesus
 Christ
 had
 been
 associated
 with
 the
 Father
 from
 the
 beginning
 as
 is
 set
 forth
 in
 the
 revelation
 cited
 We
 read
 therein
 And
 he
 John
 bore
 record
 saying
 I
 saw
 his
 glory
 that
 he
 was
 in
 the
 beginning
 before
 the
 world
 was
 therefore
 in
 the
 beginning
 the
 Word
 was
 for
 he
 was
 the
 Word
 even
 the
 messenger
 of
 salvation
 the
 light
 and
 the
 Redeemer
 of
 the
 world
 the
 Spirit
 of
 truth
 who
 came
 into
 the
 world
 because
 the
 world
 was
 made
 by
 him
 and
 in
 him
 was
 the
 life
 of
 men
 and
 the
 light
 of
 men
 The
 worlds
 were
 made
 by
 him
 men
 were
 made
 by
 him
 all
 things
 were
 made
 by
 him
 and
 through
 him
 and
 of
 him
 And
 I
 John
 bear
 record
 that
 I
 beheld
 his
 glory
 as
 the
 glory
 of
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 of
 the
 Father
 full
 of
 grace
 and
 truth
 even
 the
 Spirit
 of
 truth
 which
 came
 and

 NazarethA
 town
 or
 city
 in
 Galilee
 of
 which
 Biblical
 mention
 is
 found
 in
 the
 New
 Testament
 only
 Josephus
 says
 nothing
 concerning
 the
 place
 The
 name
 of
 the
 existing
 village
 or
 the
 Nazareth
 of
 today
 is
 EnNazirah
 This
 occupies
 an
 upland
 site
 on
 the
 southerly
 ridge
 of

 and
 commands
 a
 splendid
 view
 of
 the

 picturesque

 Zenos
 The
 author
 of

 in

 identifies
 the
 modern
 EnNazirah
 with
 the
 Nazareth
 of
 old
 on
 the
 following
 grounds
 It
 is
 on
 the
 lower
 declivities
 of
 a
 hill
 or
 mountain
 Luke
 
 it
 is
 within
 the
 limits
 of
 the
 province
 of
 Galilee
 Mark
 
 it

 near
 Cana
 John
 
 
 
 a
 precipice

 neighborhood
 Luke
 
 and
 a
 series
 of
 testimonials
 reaching
 back
 to
 Eusebius
 represent
 the
 place
 as
 having
 occupied
 the
 same
 position
 The
 same
 writer
 adds
 Its
 population
 is
 
 or
 
 a
 few
 are
 Mohammedans
 the
 rest
 Latin
 and
 Greek
 Christians
 Most
 of
 the
 houses
 are
 well
 built
 of
 stone
 and
 appear
 neat
 and
 comfortable
 The
 streets
 or
 lanes
 are
 narrow
 and
 crooked
 and
 after

 are
 so
 full
 of
 mud
 and
 mire
 as
 to
 be
 almost
 impassable
 At
 the
 time
 of
 Christs
 life
 the
 town
 was
 not
 only
 regarded
 as
 unimportant
 by
 the
 Judeans
 who
 professed
 but
 little
 respect
 for
 Galilee
 or
 the
 Galileans
 but
 as
 without
 honor
 by
 the
 Galileans
 themselves
 as
 appears
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 seemingly
 contemptuous
 question
 Can
 there
 any
 good

 was
 uttered
 by
 Nathanael
 John
 
 who
 was

 CHAPTER
 
 IN
 THE
 WILDERNESS
 OF
 JUDEA
 THE
 VOICE
 IN
 THE
 WILDERNESS
 At
 a
 time
 definitely
 stated
 as
 the
 fifteenth
 year
 of
 the
 reign
 of
 Tiberius
 Csar
 emperor
 of
 Rome
 the
 people
 of
 Judea
 were
 greatly
 aroused
 over
 the
 strange
 preaching
 of
 a
 man
 theretofore
 unknown
 He
 was
 of
 priestly
 descent
 but
 untrained
 in
 the
 schools
 and
 without
 authorization
 of
 the
 rabbis
 or
 license
 from
 the
 chief
 priests
 he
 proclaimed
 himself
 as
 one
 sent
 of
 God
 with
 a
 message
 to
 Israel
 He
 appeared
 not
 in
 the
 synagogs
 nor
 within
 the
 temple
 courts
 where
 scribes
 and
 doctors
 taught
 but
 cried
 aloud
 in
 the
 wilderness
 The
 people
 of
 Jerusalem
 and
 of
 adjacent
 rural
 parts
 went
 out
 in
 great
 multitudes
 to
 hear
 him
 He
 disdained
 the
 soft
 garments
 and
 flowing
 robes
 of
 comfort
 and
 preached
 in
 his
 rough
 desert
 garb
 consisting
 of
 a
 garment
 of
 camels
 hair
 held
 in
 place
 by
 a
 leathern
 girdle
 The
 coarseness
 of
 his
 attire
 was
 regarded
 as
 significant
 Elijah
 the
 Tishbite
 that
 fearless
 prophet
 whose
 home
 had
 been
 the
 desert
 was
 known
 in
 his
 day
 as
 an
 hairy
 man
 and
 girt
 with
 a
 girdle
 of
 leather
 about
 his
 loins
 and
 rough
 garments
 had
 come
 to
 be
 thought
 of
 as
 a
 distinguishing
 characteristic
 of
 prophets
 Nor
 did
 this
 strange
 preacher
 eat
 the
 food
 of
 luxury
 and
 ease
 but
 fed
 on
 what
 the
 desert
 supplied
 locusts
 and
 wild
 honey
 The
 man
 was
 John
 son
 of
 Zacharias
 soon
 to
 be
 known
 as
 the
 Baptist
 He
 had
 spent
 many
 years
 in
 the
 desert
 apart
 from
 the
 abodes
 of
 men
 years
 of
 preparation
 for
 his
 particular
 mission
 He
 had
 been
 a
 student
 under
 the
 tutelage
 of
 divine
 teachers
 and
 there
 in
 the
 wilderness
 of
 Judea
 the
 word
 of
 the
 Lord
 reached
 him
 as
 in
 similar
 environment
 it
 had
 reached
 Moses
 and
 Elijah
 of
 old
 Then
 was
 heard
 The
 voice
 of
 one
 crying
 in
 the
 wilderness
 Prepare
 ye
 the
 way
 of
 the
 Lord
 make
 his
 paths
 straight
 It
 was
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 herald
 the
 messenger
 who
 as
 the
 prophets
 had
 said
 should
 go
 before
 the
 Lord
 to
 prepare
 His
 way
 The
 burden
 of
 his
 message
 was
 Repent
 ye
 for
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 at
 hand
 And
 to
 such
 as
 had
 faith
 in
 his
 words
 and
 professed
 repentance
 confessing
 their
 sins
 he
 administered
 baptism
 by
 immersion
 in
 waterproclaiming
 the
 while
 I
 indeed
 baptize
 you
 with
 water
 unto
 repentance
 but
 he
 that
 cometh
 after
 me
 is
 mightier
 than
 I
 whose
 shoes
 I
 am
 not
 worthy
 to
 bear
 he
 shall
 baptize
 you
 with
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 and
 with
 fire
 Neither
 the
 man
 nor
 his
 message
 could
 be
 ignored
 his
 preaching
 was
 specific
 in
 promise
 to
 the
 repentant
 soul
 and
 scathingly
 denunciatory
 to
 the
 hypocrite
 and
 the
 hardened
 sinner
 When
 Pharisees
 and
 Sadducees
 came
 to
 his
 baptism
 prating
 of
 the
 law
 the
 spirit
 of
 which
 they
 ceased
 not
 to
 transgress
 and
 of
 the
 prophets
 whom
 they
 dishonored
 he
 denounced
 them
 as
 a
 generation
 of
 vipers
 and
 demanded
 of
 them
 Who
 hath
 warned
 you
 to
 flee
 from
 the
 wrath
 to
 come
 He
 brushed
 aside
 their
 oftrepeated
 boasts
 that
 they
 were
 the
 children
 of
 Abraham
 saying
 Bring
 forth
 therefore
 fruits
 meet
 for
 repentance
 and
 think
 not
 to
 say
 within
 yourselves
 We
 have
 Abraham
 to
 our
 father
 for
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 that
 God
 is
 able
 of
 these
 stones
 to
 raise
 up
 children
 unto
 Abraham
 The
 ignoring
 of
 their
 claims
 to
 preferment
 as
 the
 children
 of
 Abraham
 was
 a
 strong
 rebuke
 and
 a
 cause
 of
 sore
 affront
 alike
 to
 aristocratic
 Sadducee
 and
 rulebound
 Pharisee
 Judaism
 held
 that
 the
 posterity
 of
 Abraham
 had
 an
 assured
 place
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 the
 expected
 Messiah
 and
 that
 no
 proselyte
 from
 among
 the
 Gentiles
 could
 possibly
 attain
 the
 rank
 and
 distinction
 of
 which
 the
 children
 were
 sure
 Johns
 forceful
 assertion
 that
 God
 could
 raise
 up
 from
 the
 stones
 on
 the
 river
 bank
 children
 to
 Abraham
 meant
 to
 those
 who
 heard
 that
 even
 the
 lowest
 of
 the
 human
 family
 might
 be
 preferred
 before
 themselves
 unless
 they
 repented
 and
 reformed
 Their
 time
 of
 wordy
 profession
 had
 passed
 fruits
 were
 demanded
 not
 barren
 though
 leafy
 profusion
 the
 ax
 was
 ready
 aye
 at
 the
 very
 root
 of
 the
 tree
 and
 every
 tree
 that
 produced
 not
 good
 fruit
 was
 to
 be
 hewn
 down
 and
 cast
 into
 the
 fire
 The
 people
 were
 astonished
 and
 many
 seeing
 themselves
 in
 their
 actual
 condition
 of
 dereliction
 and
 sin
 as
 John
 with
 burning
 words
 laid
 bare
 their
 faults
 cried
 out
 What
 shall
 we
 do
 then
 His
 reply
 was
 directed
 against
 ceremonialism
 which
 had
 caused
 spirituality
 to
 wither
 almost
 to
 death
 in
 the
 hearts
 of
 the
 people
 Unselfish
 charity
 was
 demandedHe
 that
 hath
 two
 coats
 let
 him
 impart
 to
 him
 that
 hath
 none
 and
 he
 that
 hath
 meat
 let
 him
 do
 likewise
 The
 publicans
 or
 taxfarmers
 and
 collectors
 under
 whose
 unjust
 and
 unlawful
 exactions
 the
 people
 had
 suffered
 so
 long
 came
 asking
 Master
 what
 shall
 we
 do
 And
 he
 said
 unto
 them
 Exact
 no
 more
 than
 that
 which
 is
 appointed
 you
 To
 the
 soldiers
 who
 asked
 what
 to
 do
 he
 replied
 Do
 violence
 to
 no
 man
 neither
 accuse
 any
 falsely
 and
 be
 content
 with
 your
 wages
 The
 spirit
 of
 his
 demands
 was
 that
 of
 a
 practical
 religion
 the
 only
 religion
 of
 any
 possible
 worththe
 religion
 of
 right
 living
 With
 all
 his
 vigor
 in
 spite
 of
 his
 brusqueness
 notwithstanding
 his
 forceful
 assaults
 on
 the
 degenerate
 customs
 of
 the
 times
 this
 John
 was
 no
 agitator
 against
 established
 institutions
 no
 inciter
 of
 riot
 no
 advocate
 of
 revolt
 no
 promoter
 of
 rebellion
 He
 did
 not
 assail
 the
 tax
 system
 but
 the
 extortions
 of
 the
 corrupt
 and
 avaricious
 publicans
 he
 did
 not
 denounce
 the
 army
 but
 the
 iniquities
 of
 the
 soldiers
 many
 of
 whom
 had
 taken
 advantage
 of
 their
 position
 to
 bear
 false
 witness
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 gain
 and
 to
 enrich
 themselves
 by
 forcible
 seizure
 He
 preached
 what
 in
 the
 now
 current
 dispensation
 we
 call
 the
 first
 or
 fundamental
 principles
 of
 the
 gospelthe
 beginning
 of
 the
 gospel
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 comprizing
 faith
 which
 is
 vitalized
 belief
 in
 God
 genuine
 repentance
 which
 comprizes
 contrition
 for
 past
 offenses
 and
 a
 resolute
 determination
 to
 turn
 from
 sin
 baptism
 by
 immersion
 in
 water
 at
 his
 hands
 as
 the
 hands
 of
 one
 having
 authority
 and
 the
 higher
 baptism
 by
 fire
 or
 the
 bestowal
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 by
 an
 authority
 greater
 than
 that
 possessed
 by
 himself
 His
 preaching
 was
 positive
 and
 in
 many
 respects
 opposed
 to
 the
 conventions
 of
 the
 times
 he
 made
 no
 appeal
 to
 the
 people
 through
 the
 medium
 of
 miraculous
 manifestations
 and
 though
 many
 of
 his
 hearers
 attached
 themselves
 to
 him
 as
 disciples
 he
 established
 no
 formal
 organization
 nor
 did
 he
 attempt
 to
 form
 a
 cult
 His
 demand
 for
 repentance
 was
 an
 individual
 call
 as
 unto
 each
 acceptable
 applicant
 the
 rite
 of
 baptism
 was
 individually
 administered
 To
 the
 Jews
 who
 were
 living
 in
 a
 state
 of
 expectancy
 waiting
 for
 the
 longpredicted
 Messiah
 the
 words
 of
 this
 strange
 prophet
 in
 the
 wilderness
 were
 fraught
 with
 deep
 portent
 Could
 it
 be
 that
 he
 was
 the
 Christ
 He
 spoke
 of
 One
 yet
 to
 come
 mightier
 than
 himself
 whose
 shoelatchet
 he
 was
 not
 worthy
 to
 loosen
 One
 who
 would
 separate
 the
 people
 as
 the
 thresher
 fan
 in
 hand
 blew
 the
 chaff
 from
 the
 wheat
 and
 he
 added
 that
 mightier
 One
 will
 gather
 the
 wheat
 into
 his
 garner
 but
 the
 chaff
 he
 will
 burn
 with
 fire
 unquenchable
 In
 such
 wise
 did
 the
 predicted
 herald
 of
 the
 Lord
 deliver
 his
 message
 Himself
 he
 would
 not
 exalt
 his
 office
 however
 was
 sacred
 to
 him
 and
 with
 its
 functions
 he
 brooked
 no
 interference
 from
 priest
 Levite
 or
 rabbi
 He
 was
 no
 respecter
 of
 persons
 sin
 he
 denounced
 sinners
 he
 excoriated
 whether
 in
 priestly
 vestments
 peasant
 garb
 or
 royal
 robes
 All
 the
 claims
 the
 Baptist
 had
 made
 for
 himself
 and
 his
 mission
 were
 later
 confirmed
 and
 vindicated
 by
 the
 specific
 testimony
 of
 Christ
 John
 was
 the
 harbinger
 not
 alone
 of
 the
 kingdom
 but
 of
 the
 King
 and
 to
 him
 the
 King
 in
 person
 came
 THE
 BAPTISM
 OF
 JESUSTO
 FULFIL
 ALL
 RIGHTEOUSNESS
 When
 Jesus
 began
 to
 be
 about
 thirty
 years
 of
 age
 He
 journeyed
 from
 His
 home
 in
 Galilee
 to
 Jordan
 unto
 John
 to
 be
 baptized
 of
 him
 But
 John
 forbad
 him
 saying
 I
 have
 need
 to
 be
 baptized
 of
 thee
 and
 comest
 thou
 to
 me
 And
 Jesus
 answering
 said
 unto
 him
 Suffer
 it
 to
 be
 so
 now
 for
 thus
 it
 becometh
 us
 to
 fulfil
 all
 righteousness
 Then
 he
 suffered
 him
 John
 and
 Jesus
 were
 second
 cousins
 as
 to
 whether
 there
 had
 existed
 any
 close
 companionship
 between
 the
 two
 as
 boys
 or
 men
 we
 are
 not
 told
 It
 is
 certain
 however
 that
 when
 Jesus
 presented
 Himself
 for
 baptism
 John
 recognized
 in
 Him
 a
 sinless
 Man
 who
 stood
 in
 no
 need
 of
 repentance
 and
 as
 the
 Baptist
 had
 been
 commissioned
 to
 baptize
 for
 the
 remission
 of
 sins
 he
 saw
 no
 necessity
 of
 administering
 the
 ordinance
 to
 Jesus
 He
 who
 had
 received
 the
 confessions
 of
 multitudes
 now
 reverently
 confessed
 to
 One
 whom
 he
 knew
 was
 more
 righteous
 than
 himself
 In
 the
 light
 of
 later
 events
 it
 appears
 that
 at
 this
 time
 John
 did
 not
 know
 that
 Jesus
 was
 the
 Christ
 the
 Mightier
 One
 for
 whom
 he
 waited
 and
 whose
 forerunner
 he
 knew
 himself
 to
 be
 When
 John
 expressed
 his
 conviction
 that
 Jesus
 needed
 no
 baptismal
 cleansing
 our
 Lord
 conscious
 of
 His
 own
 sinlessness
 did
 not
 deny
 the
 Baptists
 imputation
 but
 nevertheless
 pressed
 His
 application
 for
 baptism
 with
 the
 significant
 explanation
 Thus
 it
 becometh
 us
 to
 fulfil
 all
 righteousness
 If
 John
 was
 able
 to
 comprehend
 the
 deeper
 meaning
 of
 this
 utterance
 he
 must
 have
 found
 therein
 the
 truth
 that
 water
 baptism
 is
 not
 alone
 the
 means
 provided
 for
 gaining
 remission
 of
 sins
 but
 is
 also
 an
 indispensable
 ordinance
 established
 in
 righteousness
 and
 required
 of
 all
 mankind
 as
 an
 essential
 condition
 for
 membership
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 Jesus
 Christ
 thus
 humbly
 complied
 with
 the
 will
 of
 the
 Father
 and
 was
 baptized
 of
 John
 by
 immersion
 in
 water
 That
 His
 baptism
 was
 accepted
 as
 a
 pleasing
 and
 necessary
 act
 of
 submission
 was
 attested
 by
 what
 immediately
 ensued
 And
 Jesus
 when
 he
 was
 baptized
 went
 up
 straightway
 out
 of
 the
 water
 and
 lo
 the
 heavens
 were
 opened
 unto
 him
 and
 he
 saw
 the
 Spirit
 of
 God
 descending
 like
 a
 dove
 and
 lighting
 upon
 him
 and
 lo
 a
 voice
 from
 heaven
 saying
 This
 is
 my
 beloved
 Son
 in
 whom
 I
 am
 well
 pleased
 Then
 John
 knew
 his
 Redeemer
 The
 four
 Gospelwriters
 record
 the
 descent
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 upon
 the
 baptized
 Jesus
 as
 accompanied
 by
 a
 visible
 manifestation
 like
 a
 dove
 and
 this
 sign
 had
 been
 indicated
 to
 John
 as
 the
 foreappointed
 means
 by
 which
 the
 Messiah
 should
 be
 made
 known
 to
 him
 and
 to
 that
 sign
 before
 specified
 was
 now
 added
 the
 supreme
 testimony
 of
 the
 Father
 as
 to
 the
 literal
 Sonship
 of
 Jesus
 Matthew
 records
 the
 Fathers
 acknowledgment
 as
 given
 in
 the
 third
 person
 This
 is
 my
 beloved
 Son
 while
 both
 Mark
 and
 Luke
 give
 the
 more
 direct
 address
 Thou
 art
 my
 beloved
 Son
 The
 variation
 slight
 and
 essentially
 unimportant
 as
 it
 is
 though
 bearing
 on
 so
 momentous
 a
 subject
 affords
 evidence
 of
 independent
 authorship
 and
 discredits
 any
 insinuation
 of
 collusion
 among
 the
 writers
 The
 incidents
 attending
 the
 emergence
 of
 Jesus
 from
 the
 baptismal
 grave
 demonstrate
 the
 distinct
 individuality
 of
 the
 three
 Personages
 of
 the
 Godhead
 On
 that
 solemn
 occasion
 Jesus
 the
 Son
 was
 present
 in
 the
 flesh
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 was
 manifest
 through
 the
 accompanying
 sign
 of
 the
 dove
 and
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 was
 heard
 from
 heaven
 Had
 we
 no
 other
 evidence
 of
 the
 separate
 personality
 of
 each
 member
 of
 the
 Holy
 Trinity
 this
 instance
 should
 be
 conclusive
 but
 other
 scriptures
 confirm
 the
 great
 truth
 THE
 TEMPTATIONS
 OF
 CHRIST
 Soon
 after
 His
 baptism
 immediately
 thereafter
 as
 Mark
 asserts
 Jesus
 was
 constrained
 by
 the
 promptings
 of
 the
 Spirit
 to
 withdraw
 from
 men
 and
 the
 distractions
 of
 community
 life
 by
 retiring
 into
 the
 wilderness
 where
 He
 would
 be
 free
 to
 commune
 with
 His
 God
 So
 strong
 was
 the
 influence
 of
 the
 impelling
 force
 that
 He
 was
 led
 thereby
 or
 as
 stated
 by
 the
 evangelist
 driven
 into
 solitary
 seclusion
 in
 which
 He
 remained
 during
 forty
 days
 with
 the
 wild
 beasts
 of
 the
 desert
 This
 remarkable
 episode
 in
 our
 Lords
 life
 is
 described
 though
 not
 with
 equal
 fulness
 in
 three
 of
 the
 Gospels
 John
 is
 silent
 thereon
 The
 circumstances
 attending
 this
 time
 of
 exile
 and
 test
 must
 have
 been
 related
 by
 Jesus
 Himself
 for
 of
 other
 human
 witnesses
 there
 were
 none
 The
 recorded
 narratives
 deal
 principally
 with
 events
 marking
 the
 close
 of
 the
 fortyday
 period
 but
 considered
 in
 their
 entirety
 they
 place
 beyond
 doubt
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 season
 was
 one
 of
 fasting
 and
 prayer
 Christs
 realization
 that
 He
 was
 the
 chosen
 and
 foreordained
 Messiah
 came
 to
 Him
 gradually
 As
 shown
 by
 His
 words
 to
 His
 mother
 on
 the
 occasion
 of
 the
 memorable
 interview
 with
 the
 doctors
 in
 the
 temple
 courts
 He
 knew
 when
 but
 a
 Boy
 of
 twelve
 years
 that
 in
 a
 particular
 and
 personal
 sense
 He
 was
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 yet
 it
 is
 evident
 that
 a
 comprehension
 of
 the
 full
 purport
 of
 His
 earthly
 mission
 developed
 within
 Him
 only
 as
 He
 progressed
 step
 by
 step
 in
 wisdom
 His
 acknowledgment
 by
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 continued
 companionship
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 opened
 His
 soul
 to
 the
 glorious
 fact
 of
 His
 divinity
 He
 had
 much
 to
 think
 about
 much
 that
 demanded
 prayer
 and
 the
 communion
 with
 God
 that
 prayer
 alone
 could
 insure
 Throughout
 the
 period
 of
 retirement
 he
 ate
 not
 but
 chose
 to
 fast
 that
 His
 mortal
 body
 might
 the
 more
 completely
 be
 subjected
 to
 His
 divine
 spirit
 Then
 when
 He
 was
 hungry
 and
 physically
 weak
 the
 tempter
 came
 with
 the
 insidious
 suggestion
 that
 He
 use
 His
 extraordinary
 powers
 to
 provide
 food
 Satan
 had
 chosen
 the
 most
 propitious
 time
 for
 his
 evil
 purpose
 What
 will
 mortals
 not
 do
 to
 what
 lengths
 have
 men
 not
 gone
 to
 assuage
 the
 pangs
 of
 hunger
 Esau
 bartered
 his
 birthright
 for
 a
 meal
 Men
 have
 fought
 like
 brutes
 for
 food
 Women
 have
 slain
 and
 eaten
 their
 own
 babes
 rather
 than
 endure
 the
 gnawing
 pangs
 of
 starvation
 All
 this
 Satan
 knew
 when
 he
 came
 to
 the
 Christ
 in
 the
 hour
 of
 extreme
 physical
 need
 and
 said
 unto
 Him
 If
 thou
 be
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 command
 that
 these
 stones
 be
 made
 bread
 During
 the
 long
 weeks
 of
 seclusion
 our
 Lord
 had
 been
 sustained
 by
 the
 exaltation
 of
 spirit
 that
 would
 naturally
 attend
 such
 allabsorbing
 concentration
 of
 mind
 as
 His
 protracted
 meditation
 and
 communion
 with
 the
 heavens
 undoubtedly
 produced
 in
 such
 profound
 devotion
 of
 spirit
 bodily
 appetites
 were
 subdued
 and
 superseded
 but
 the
 reaction
 of
 the
 flesh
 was
 inevitable
 Hungry
 as
 Jesus
 was
 there
 was
 a
 temptation
 in
 Satans
 words
 even
 greater
 than
 that
 embodied
 in
 the
 suggestion
 that
 He
 provide
 food
 for
 His
 famishing
 bodythe
 temptation
 to
 put
 to
 proof
 the
 possible
 doubt
 implied
 in
 the
 tempters
 If
 The
 Eternal
 Father
 had
 proclaimed
 Jesus
 as
 His
 Son
 the
 devil
 tried
 to
 make
 the
 Son
 doubt
 that
 divine
 relationship
 Why
 not
 prove
 the
 Fathers
 interest
 in
 His
 Son
 at
 this
 moment
 of
 dire
 necessity
 Was
 it
 proper
 that
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 should
 go
 hungry
 Had
 the
 Father
 so
 soon
 forgotten
 as
 to
 leave
 His
 Beloved
 Son
 thus
 to
 suffer
 Was
 it
 not
 reasonable
 that
 Jesus
 faint
 from
 long
 abstinence
 should
 provide
 for
 Himself
 and
 particularly
 so
 since
 He
 could
 provide
 and
 that
 by
 a
 word
 of
 command
 if
 the
 voice
 heard
 at
 His
 baptism
 was
 that
 of
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 If
 thou
 be
 in
 reality
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 demonstrate
 thy
 power
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 satisfy
 thy
 hungersuch
 was
 the
 purport
 of
 the
 diabolical
 suggestion
 To
 have
 yielded
 would
 have
 been
 to
 manifest
 positive
 doubt
 of
 the
 Fathers
 acknowledgment
 Moreover
 the
 superior
 power
 that
 Jesus
 possessed
 had
 not
 been
 given
 to
 Him
 for
 personal
 gratification
 but
 for
 service
 to
 others
 He
 was
 to
 experience
 all
 the
 trials
 of
 mortality
 another
 man
 as
 hungry
 as
 He
 could
 not
 provide
 for
 himself
 by
 a
 miracle
 and
 though
 by
 miracle
 such
 a
 one
 might
 be
 fed
 the
 miraculous
 supply
 would
 have
 to
 be
 given
 not
 provided
 by
 himself
 It
 was
 a
 necessary
 result
 of
 our
 Lords
 dual
 nature
 comprizing
 the
 attributes
 of
 both
 God
 and
 man
 that
 He
 should
 endure
 and
 suffer
 as
 a
 mortal
 while
 possessing
 at
 all
 times
 the
 ability
 to
 invoke
 the
 power
 of
 His
 own
 Godhood
 by
 which
 all
 bodily
 needs
 could
 be
 supplied
 or
 overcome
 His
 reply
 to
 the
 tempter
 was
 sublime
 and
 positively
 final
 It
 is
 written
 Man
 shall
 not
 live
 by
 bread
 alone
 but
 by
 every
 word
 that
 proceedeth
 out
 of
 the
 mouth
 of
 God
 The
 word
 that
 had
 proceeded
 from
 the
 mouth
 of
 God
 upon
 which
 Satan
 would
 have
 cast
 mistrust
 was
 that
 Jesus
 was
 the
 Beloved
 Son
 with
 whom
 the
 Father
 was
 well
 pleased
 The
 devil
 was
 foiled
 Christ
 was
 triumphant
 Realizing
 that
 he
 had
 utterly
 failed
 in
 his
 attempt
 to
 induce
 Jesus
 to
 use
 His
 inherent
 power
 for
 personal
 service
 and
 to
 trust
 in
 Himself
 rather
 than
 rely
 upon
 the
 Fathers
 providence
 Satan
 went
 to
 the
 other
 extreme
 and
 tempted
 Jesus
 to
 wantonly
 throw
 Himself
 upon
 the
 Fathers
 protection
 Jesus
 was
 standing
 upon
 one
 of
 the
 high
 parts
 of
 the
 temple
 a
 pinnacle
 or
 battlement
 overlooking
 the
 spacious
 courts
 when
 the
 devil
 said
 unto
 Him
 If
 thou
 be
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 cast
 thyself
 down
 for
 it
 is
 written
 He
 shall
 give
 his
 angels
 charge
 concerning
 thee
 and
 in
 their
 hands
 they
 shall
 bear
 thee
 up
 lest
 at
 any
 time
 thou
 dash
 thy
 foot
 against
 a
 stone
 Again
 appears
 the
 implication
 of
 doubt
 If
 Jesus
 was
 in
 fact
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 could
 He
 not
 trust
 His
 Father
 to
 save
 Him
 and
 particularly
 so
 as
 it
 was
 written
 that
 angels
 would
 guard
 Him
 and
 bear
 Him
 up
 Christs
 reply
 to
 the
 tempter
 in
 the
 wilderness
 had
 embodied
 a
 scriptural
 citation
 and
 this
 He
 had
 introduced
 with
 the
 impressive
 formula
 common
 to
 expounders
 of
 sacred
 writIt
 is
 written
 In
 the
 second
 attempt
 the
 devil
 tried
 to
 support
 his
 suggestion
 by
 scripture
 and
 employed
 a
 similar
 expressionfor
 it
 is
 written
 Our
 Lord
 met
 and
 answered
 the
 devils
 quotation
 with
 another
 saying
 It
 is
 written
 again
 Thou
 shalt
 not
 tempt
 the
 Lord
 thy
 God
 Beside
 the
 provocation
 to
 sin
 by
 wantonly
 placing
 Himself
 in
 danger
 so
 that
 the
 Fathers
 love
 might
 be
 manifested
 in
 a
 miraculous
 rescue
 or
 by
 refusing
 so
 to
 challenge
 the
 Fathers
 interposition
 demonstrate
 that
 He
 doubted
 His
 status
 as
 the
 Beloved
 Son
 there
 lurked
 an
 appeal
 to
 the
 human
 side
 of
 Christs
 nature
 in
 thought
 of
 the
 fame
 which
 an
 astounding
 exploit
 such
 as
 that
 of
 leaping
 from
 the
 dizzy
 height
 of
 the
 temple
 turrets
 and
 alighting
 unhurt
 would
 surely
 bring
 We
 cannot
 resist
 the
 thought
 though
 we
 be
 not
 justified
 in
 saying
 that
 any
 such
 had
 even
 momentary
 place
 in
 the
 Saviors
 mind
 that
 to
 act
 upon
 Satans
 suggestion
 provided
 of
 course
 the
 outcome
 proved
 to
 be
 such
 as
 he
 had
 indicated
 would
 have
 been
 to
 insure
 public
 recognition
 of
 Jesus
 as
 a
 Being
 superior
 to
 mortals
 It
 would
 have
 been
 a
 sign
 and
 a
 wonder
 indeed
 the
 fame
 of
 which
 would
 have
 spread
 as
 fire
 in
 the
 dry
 grass
 and
 all
 Jewry
 would
 have
 been
 aflame
 with
 excitement
 and
 interest
 in
 the
 Christ
 The
 glaring
 sophistry
 of
 Satans
 citation
 of
 scripture
 was
 unworthy
 a
 categorical
 reply
 his
 doctrine
 deserved
 neither
 logic
 nor
 argument
 his
 misapplication
 of
 the
 written
 word
 was
 nullified
 by
 scripture
 that
 was
 germane
 the
 lines
 of
 the
 psalmist
 were
 met
 by
 the
 binding
 fiat
 of
 the
 prophet
 of
 the
 exodus
 in
 which
 he
 had
 commanded
 Israel
 that
 they
 should
 not
 provoke
 nor
 tempt
 the
 Lord
 to
 work
 miracles
 among
 them
 Satan
 tempted
 Jesus
 to
 tempt
 the
 Father
 It
 is
 as
 truly
 a
 blasphemous
 interference
 with
 the
 prerogatives
 of
 Deity
 to
 set
 limitations
 or
 make
 fixations
 of
 time
 or
 place
 at
 which
 the
 divine
 power
 shall
 be
 made
 manifest
 as
 it
 is
 to
 attempt
 to
 usurp
 that
 power
 God
 alone
 must
 decide
 when
 and
 how
 His
 wonders
 shall
 be
 wrought
 Once
 more
 the
 purposes
 of
 Satan
 were
 thwarted
 and
 Christ
 again
 was
 victor
 In
 the
 third
 temptation
 the
 devil
 refrained
 from
 further
 appeal
 to
 Jesus
 to
 put
 either
 His
 own
 power
 or
 that
 of
 the
 Father
 to
 the
 test
 Twice
 completely
 foiled
 the
 tempter
 abandoned
 that
 plan
 of
 assault
 and
 discarding
 all
 disguise
 of
 purpose
 submitted
 a
 definite
 proposition
 From
 the
 top
 of
 a
 high
 mountain
 Jesus
 looked
 over
 the
 land
 with
 its
 wealth
 of
 city
 and
 field
 of
 vineyard
 and
 orchard
 of
 flocks
 and
 of
 herds
 and
 in
 vision
 He
 saw
 the
 kingdoms
 of
 the
 world
 and
 contemplated
 the
 wealth
 the
 splendor
 the
 earthly
 glory
 of
 them
 all
 Then
 saith
 Satan
 unto
 Him
 All
 these
 things
 will
 I
 give
 thee
 if
 thou
 wilt
 fall
 down
 and
 worship
 me
 So
 wrote
 Matthew
 the
 more
 extended
 version
 by
 Luke
 follows
 And
 the
 devil
 said
 unto
 him
 All
 this
 power
 will
 I
 give
 thee
 and
 the
 glory
 of
 them
 for
 that
 is
 delivered
 unto
 me
 and
 to
 whomsoever
 I
 will
 I
 give
 it
 If
 thou
 therefore
 wilt
 worship
 me
 all
 shall
 be
 thine
 We
 need
 not
 concern
 ourselves
 with
 conjecture
 as
 to
 whether
 Satan
 could
 have
 made
 good
 his
 promise
 in
 the
 event
 of
 Christs
 doing
 him
 homage
 certain
 it
 is
 Christ
 could
 have
 reached
 out
 and
 have
 gathered
 to
 Himself
 the
 wealth
 and
 glory
 of
 the
 world
 had
 He
 willed
 so
 to
 do
 and
 thereby
 have
 failed
 in
 His
 Messianic
 mission
 This
 fact
 Satan
 knew
 full
 well
 Many
 men
 have
 sold
 themselves
 to
 the
 devil
 for
 a
 kingdom
 and
 for
 less
 aye
 even
 for
 a
 few
 paltry
 pence
 The
 effrontery
 of
 his
 offer
 was
 of
 itself
 diabolical
 Christ
 the
 Creator
 of
 heaven
 and
 earth
 tabernacled
 as
 He
 then
 was
 in
 mortal
 flesh
 may
 not
 have
 remembered
 His
 preexistent
 state
 nor
 the
 part
 He
 had
 taken
 in
 the
 great
 council
 of
 the
 Gods
 while
 Satan
 an
 unembodied
 spirithe
 the
 disinherited
 the
 rebellious
 and
 rejected
 sonseeking
 to
 tempt
 the
 Being
 through
 whom
 the
 world
 was
 created
 by
 promising
 Him
 part
 of
 what
 was
 wholly
 His
 still
 may
 have
 had
 as
 indeed
 he
 may
 yet
 have
 a
 remembrance
 of
 those
 primeval
 scenes
 In
 that
 distant
 past
 antedating
 the
 creation
 of
 the
 earth
 Satan
 then
 Lucifer
 a
 son
 of
 the
 morning
 had
 been
 rejected
 and
 the
 Firstborn
 Son
 had
 been
 chosen
 Now
 that
 the
 Chosen
 One
 was
 subject
 to
 the
 trials
 incident
 to
 mortality
 Satan
 thought
 to
 thwart
 the
 divine
 purpose
 by
 making
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 subject
 to
 himself
 He
 who
 had
 been
 vanquished
 by
 Michael
 and
 his
 hosts
 and
 cast
 down
 as
 a
 defeated
 rebel
 asked
 the
 embodied
 Jehovah
 to
 worship
 him
 Then
 saith
 Jesus
 unto
 him
 Get
 thee
 hence
 Satan
 for
 it
 is
 written
 Thou
 shalt
 worship
 the
 Lord
 thy
 God
 and
 him
 only
 shalt
 thou
 serve
 Then
 the
 devil
 leaveth
 him
 and
 behold
 angels
 came
 and
 ministered
 unto
 him
 It
 is
 not
 to
 be
 supposed
 that
 Christs
 victorious
 emergence
 from
 the
 dark
 clouds
 of
 the
 three
 specified
 temptations
 exempted
 Him
 from
 further
 assaults
 by
 Satan
 or
 insured
 Him
 against
 later
 trials
 of
 faith
 trust
 and
 endurance
 Luke
 closes
 his
 account
 of
 the
 temptations
 following
 the
 fortyday
 fast
 as
 follows
 And
 when
 the
 devil
 had
 ended
 all
 the
 temptation
 he
 departed
 from
 him
 for
 a
 season
 This
 victory
 over
 the
 devil
 and
 his
 wiles
 this
 triumph
 over
 the
 cravings
 of
 the
 flesh
 the
 harassing
 doubts
 of
 the
 mind
 the
 suggested
 reaching
 out
 for
 fame
 and
 material
 wealth
 were
 great
 but
 not
 final
 successes
 in
 the
 struggle
 between
 Jesus
 the
 embodied
 God
 and
 Satan
 the
 fallen
 angel
 of
 light
 That
 Christ
 was
 subject
 to
 temptation
 during
 the
 period
 of
 His
 association
 with
 the
 apostles
 He
 expressly
 affirmed
 That
 His
 temptations
 extended
 even
 to
 the
 agony
 in
 Gethsemane
 will
 appear
 as
 we
 proceed
 with
 this
 study
 It
 is
 not
 given
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 us
 nor
 was
 it
 given
 to
 Jesus
 to
 meet
 the
 foe
 to
 fight
 and
 overcome
 in
 a
 single
 encounter
 once
 for
 all
 time
 The
 strife
 between
 the
 immortal
 spirit
 and
 the
 flesh
 between
 the
 offspring
 of
 God
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 the
 world
 and
 the
 devil
 on
 the
 other
 is
 persistent
 through
 life
 Few
 events
 in
 the
 evangelical
 history
 of
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 have
 given
 rise
 to
 more
 discussion
 fanciful
 theory
 and
 barren
 speculation
 than
 have
 the
 temptations
 All
 such
 surmizes
 we
 may
 with
 propriety
 ignore
 To
 any
 believer
 in
 the
 holy
 scriptures
 the
 account
 of
 the
 temptations
 therein
 given
 is
 sufficiently
 explicit
 to
 put
 beyond
 doubt
 or
 question
 the
 essential
 facts
 to
 the
 unbeliever
 neither
 the
 Christ
 nor
 His
 triumph
 appeals
 What
 shall
 it
 profit
 us
 to
 speculate
 as
 to
 whether
 Satan
 appeared
 to
 Jesus
 in
 visible
 form
 or
 was
 present
 only
 as
 an
 unseen
 spirit
 whether
 he
 spoke
 in
 audible
 voice
 or
 aroused
 in
 the
 mind
 of
 his
 intended
 victim
 the
 thoughts
 later
 expressed
 by
 the
 written
 lines
 whether
 the
 three
 temptations
 occurred
 in
 immediate
 sequence
 or
 were
 experienced
 at
 longer
 intervals
 With
 safety
 we
 may
 reject
 all
 theories
 of
 myth
 or
 parable
 in
 the
 scriptural
 account
 and
 accept
 the
 record
 as
 it
 stands
 and
 with
 equal
 assurance
 may
 we
 affirm
 that
 the
 temptations
 were
 real
 and
 that
 the
 trials
 to
 which
 our
 Lord
 was
 put
 constituted
 an
 actual
 and
 crucial
 test
 To
 believe
 otherwise
 one
 must
 regard
 the
 scriptures
 as
 but
 fiction
 A
 question
 deserving
 some
 attention
 in
 this
 connection
 is
 that
 of
 the
 peccability
 or
 impeccability
 of
 Christthe
 question
 as
 to
 whether
 He
 was
 capable
 of
 sinning
 Had
 there
 been
 no
 possibility
 of
 His
 yielding
 to
 the
 lures
 of
 Satan
 there
 would
 have
 been
 no
 real
 test
 in
 the
 temptations
 no
 genuine
 victory
 in
 the
 result
 Our
 Lord
 was
 sinless
 yet
 peccable
 He
 had
 the
 capacity
 the
 ability
 to
 sin
 had
 He
 willed
 so
 to
 do
 Had
 He
 been
 bereft
 of
 the
 faculty
 to
 sin
 He
 would
 have
 been
 shorn
 of
 His
 free
 agency
 and
 it
 was
 to
 safeguard
 and
 insure
 the
 agency
 of
 man
 that
 He
 had
 offered
 Himself
 before
 the
 world
 was
 as
 a
 redeeming
 sacrifice
 To
 say
 that
 He
 could
 not
 sin
 because
 He
 was
 the
 embodiment
 of
 righteousness
 is
 no
 denial
 of
 His
 agency
 of
 choice
 between
 evil
 and
 good
 A
 thoroughly
 truthful
 man
 cannot
 culpably
 lie
 nevertheless
 his
 insurance
 against
 falsehood
 is
 not
 that
 of
 external
 compulsion
 but
 of
 internal
 restraint
 due
 to
 his
 cultivated
 companionship
 of
 the
 spirit
 of
 truth
 A
 really
 honest
 man
 will
 neither
 take
 nor
 covet
 his
 neighbors
 goods
 indeed
 it
 may
 be
 said
 that
 he
 cannot
 steal
 yet
 he
 is
 capable
 of
 stealing
 should
 he
 so
 elect
 His
 honesty
 is
 an
 armor
 against
 temptation
 but
 the
 coat
 of
 mail
 the
 helmet
 the
 breastplate
 and
 the
 greaves
 are
 but
 an
 outward
 covering
 the
 man
 within
 may
 be
 vulnerable
 if
 he
 can
 be
 reached
 But
 why
 proceed
 with
 labored
 reasoning
 which
 can
 lead
 to
 but
 one
 conclusion
 when
 our
 Lords
 own
 words
 and
 other
 scriptures
 confirm
 the
 fact
 Shortly
 before
 His
 betrayal
 when
 admonishing
 the
 Twelve
 to
 humility
 He
 said
 Ye
 are
 they
 which
 have
 continued
 with
 me
 in
 my
 temptations
 While
 here
 we
 find
 no
 exclusive
 reference
 to
 the
 temptations
 immediately
 following
 His
 baptism
 the
 exposition
 is
 plain
 that
 He
 had
 endured
 temptations
 and
 by
 implication
 these
 had
 continued
 throughout
 the
 period
 of
 His
 ministry
 The
 writer
 of
 the
 epistle
 to
 the
 Hebrews
 expressly
 taught
 that
 Christ
 was
 peccable
 in
 that
 He
 was
 tempted
 in
 all
 points
 as
 are
 the
 rest
 of
 mankind
 Consider
 the
 unambiguous
 declaration
 Seeing
 then
 that
 we
 have
 a
 great
 high
 priest
 that
 is
 passed
 into
 the
 heavens
 Jesus
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 let
 us
 hold
 fast
 our
 profession
 For
 we
 have
 not
 an
 high
 priest
 which
 cannot
 be
 touched
 with
 the
 feeling
 of
 our
 infirmities
 but
 was
 in
 all
 points
 tempted
 like
 as
 we
 are
 yet
 without
 sin
 And
 further
 Though
 he
 were
 a
 Son
 yet
 learned
 he
 obedience
 by
 the
 things
 which
 he
 suffered

 Raiment

 the

 raiment
 of
 camels
 hair
 worn
 by
 John

 The
 garment
 of

 hair
 was
 not
 the

 Locusts
 and
 Wild
 HoneyInsects
 of
 the
 locust
 or
 grasshopper
 kind
 were
 specifically
 declared
 clean
 and
 suitable
 for
 food
 in
 the
 law
 given
 to
 Israel
 in
 the
 wilderness
 Yet
 these
 may
 ye
 eat
 of
 every
 flying
 creeping
 thing
 that
 goeth
 upon
 all
 four
 which
 have
 legs
 above
 their
 feet
 to
 leap
 withal
 upon
 the
 earth
 even
 these
 of
 them
 ye
 may
 eat
 the
 locust
 after
 his
 kind

 gives
 place
 to
 the
 following
 as
 applied
 to
 the
 Baptists
 life
 His
 only
 food
 was
 the
 locusts
 which
 leaped
 or
 flew
 on
 the
 bare
 hills
 and
 the
 honey
 of
 wild
 bees
 which
 he
 found
 here
 and
 there
 in
 the
 clifts
 of
 the
 rocks
 and
 his
 only
 drink
 a
 draught
 of
 water
 from
 some
 rocky
 hollow
 Locusts
 are
 still
 the
 food
 of
 the
 poor
 in
 many
 parts
 of
 the
 East
 All
 the
 Bedouins
 of
 Arabia
 and
 the
 inhabitants
 of
 towns
 in
 Nedj
 and
 Hedjaz
 are
 accustomed
 to
 eat
 them
 says
 Burckhardt
 I
 have
 seen
 at
 Medina
 and
 Tayi
 locust
 shops
 where
 they
 are
 sold
 by
 measure
 In
 Egypt
 and
 Nubia
 they
 are
 eaten
 only
 by
 the
 poorest
 beggars
 The
 Arabs
 in
 preparing
 them
 for
 eating
 throw
 them
 alive
 into
 boiling
 water
 with
 which
 a
 good
 deal
 of
 salt
 has
 been
 mixed
 taking
 them
 out
 after
 a
 few
 minutes
 and
 drying
 them
 in
 the
 sun
 The
 head
 feet
 and
 wings
 are
 then
 torn
 off
 the
 bodies
 cleansed
 from
 the
 salt
 and
 perfectly
 dried
 They
 are
 sometimes
 eaten
 boiled
 in
 butter
 or
 spread
 on
 unleavened
 bread
 mixed
 with
 butter
 In
 Palestine
 they
 are
 eaten
 only
 by
 the
 Arabs
 on
 the
 extreme
 frontiers
 elsewhere
 they
 are
 looked
 on
 with
 disgust
 and
 loathing
 and
 only
 the
 very
 poorest
 use
 them
 Tristram
 however
 speaks
 of
 them
 as
 very
 palatable
 I
 found
 them
 very
 good
 says
 he
 when
 eaten
 after
 the
 Arab
 fashion
 stewed
 with
 butter
 They
 tasted
 somewhat
 like
 shrimps
 but
 with
 less
 flavour
 In
 the
 wilderness
 of
 Judea
 various
 kinds
 abound
 at
 all
 seasons
 and
 spring
 up
 with
 a
 drumming
 sound
 at
 every
 step
 suddenly
 spreading
 their
 bright
 hind
 wings
 of
 scarlet
 crimson
 blue
 yellow
 white
 green
 or
 brown
 according
 to
 the
 species
 They
 were
 clean
 under
 the
 Mosaic
 Law
 and
 hence
 could
 be
 eaten
 by
 John
 without
 offence
 Concerning
 the
 mention
 of
 wild
 honey
 as
 food
 used
 by
 John
 the
 author
 last
 quoted
 says
 in
 a
 continuation
 of
 the
 same
 paragraph
 The
 wild
 bees
 in
 Palestine
 are
 far
 more
 numerous
 than
 those
 kept
 in
 hives
 and
 the
 greater
 part
 of
 the
 honey
 sold
 in
 the
 southern
 districts
 is
 obtained
 from
 wild
 swarms
 Few
 countries
 indeed
 are
 better
 adapted
 for
 bees
 The
 dry
 climate
 and
 the
 stunted
 but
 varied
 flora
 consisting
 largely
 of
 aromatic
 thymes
 mints
 and
 other
 similar
 plants
 with
 crocuses
 in
 the
 spring
 are
 very
 favourable
 to
 them
 while
 the
 dry
 recesses
 of
 the
 limestone
 rocks
 everywhere
 afford
 them
 shelter
 and
 protection
 for
 their
 combs
 In
 the
 wilderness
 of
 Judea
 bees
 are
 far
 more
 numerous
 than
 in
 any
 other
 part
 of
 Palestine
 and
 it
 is
 to
 this
 day
 part
 of
 the
 homely
 diet
 of
 the
 Bedouins
 who
 squeeze
 it
 from
 the
 combs
 and
 store
 it
 in
 skins

 this

 One

 would
 be

 frame
 To

 it

 Dict
 of

 A
 passage
 in

 whatever
 a

 be
 required
 to
 do
 for
 his
 master
 except
 the
 loosing

 Some
 teachers
 urged
 that
 a
 disciple
 should
 carry
 his
 humility
 even
 to
 the
 extreme
 of
 carrying
 his
 masters
 shoes
 The
 humility
 of
 the
 Baptist
 in
 view
 of
 the
 widespread
 interest
 his
 call
 aroused
 is
 impressive
 
 The
 Order
 in

 the
 Temptations
 Were
 PresentedBut
 two
 of
 the
 Gospelwriters
 specify
 the
 temptations
 to
 which
 Christ
 was
 subjected
 immediately
 after
 His
 baptism
 Mark
 merely
 mentions
 the
 fact
 that
 Jesus
 was
 tempted
 Matthew
 and
 Luke
 place
 first
 the
 temptation
 that
 Jesus
 provide
 for
 Himself
 by
 miraculously
 creating
 bread
 the
 sequence
 of
 the
 later
 trials
 is
 not

 mocking
 the

 Jesus
 in
 His
 agony
 said

 And
 the

 cross
 derided
 the

 God
 saying

 be

 CHAPTER
 
 FROM
 JUDEA
 TO
 GALILEE
 THE
 BAPTISTS
 TESTIMONY
 OF
 JESUS
 During
 the
 period
 of
 our
 Lords
 retirement
 in
 the
 wilderness
 the
 Baptist
 continued
 his
 ministry
 crying
 repentance
 to
 all
 who
 would
 pause
 to
 hear
 and
 administering
 baptism
 to
 such
 as
 came
 duly
 prepared
 and
 asking
 with
 right
 intent
 The
 people
 generally
 were
 greatly
 concerned
 over
 the
 identity
 of
 John
 and
 as
 the
 real
 import
 of
 the
 voice
 dawned
 upon
 them
 their
 concern
 deepened
 into
 fear
 The
 ever
 recurring
 question
 was
 Who
 is
 this
 new
 prophet
 Then
 the
 Jews
 by
 which
 expression
 we
 may
 understand
 the
 rulers
 of
 the
 people
 sent
 a
 delegation
 of
 priests
 and
 Levites
 of
 the
 Pharisaic
 party
 to
 personally
 question
 him
 He
 answered
 without
 evasion
 I
 am
 not
 the
 Christ
 and
 with
 equal
 decisiveness
 denied
 that
 he
 was
 Elias
 or
 more
 accurately
 Elijah
 the
 prophet
 who
 the
 rabbis
 said
 through
 a
 misinterpretation
 of
 Malachis
 prediction
 was
 to
 return
 to
 earth
 as
 the
 immediate
 precursor
 of
 the
 Messiah
 Furthermore
 he
 declared
 that
 he
 was
 not
 that
 prophet
 by
 which
 was
 meant
 the
 Prophet
 whose
 coming
 Moses
 had
 foretold
 and
 who
 was
 not
 universally
 identified
 in
 the
 Jewish
 mind
 with
 the
 expected
 Messiah
 Then
 said
 they
 unto
 him
 Who
 art
 thou
 that
 we
 may
 give
 an
 answer
 to
 them
 that
 sent
 us
 What
 sayest
 thou
 of
 thyself
 He
 said
 I
 am
 the
 voice
 of
 one
 crying
 in
 the
 wilderness
 Make
 straight
 the
 way
 of
 the
 Lord
 as
 said
 the
 prophet
 Esaias
 The
 Pharisaic
 envoys
 then
 demanded
 of
 him
 his
 authority
 for
 baptizing
 in
 reply
 he
 affirmed
 that
 the
 validity
 of
 his
 baptisms
 would
 be
 attested
 by
 One
 who
 even
 then
 was
 amongst
 them
 though
 they
 knew
 Him
 not
 and
 averred
 He
 it
 is
 who
 coming
 after
 me
 is
 preferred
 before
 me
 whose
 shoes
 latchet
 I
 am
 not
 worthy
 to
 unloose
 Johns
 testimony
 that
 Jesus
 was
 the
 Redeemer
 of
 the
 world
 was
 declared
 as
 boldly
 as
 had
 been
 his
 message
 of
 the
 imminent
 coming
 of
 the
 Lord
 Behold
 the
 Lamb
 of
 God
 which
 taketh
 away
 the
 sin
 of
 the
 world
 he
 proclaimed
 and
 that
 none
 might
 fail
 to
 comprehend
 his
 identification
 of
 the
 Christ
 he
 added
 This
 is
 he
 of
 whom
 I
 said
 After
 me
 cometh
 a
 man
 which
 is
 preferred
 before
 me
 for
 he
 was
 before
 me
 And
 I
 knew
 him
 not
 but
 that
 he
 should
 be
 made
 manifest
 to
 Israel
 therefore
 am
 I
 come
 baptizing
 with
 water
 That
 the
 attestation
 of
 the
 ministering
 presence
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 through
 the
 material
 appearance
 like
 a
 dove
 was
 convincing
 to
 John
 is
 shown
 by
 his
 further
 testimony
 And
 John
 bare
 record
 saying
 I
 saw
 the
 Spirit
 descending
 from
 heaven
 like
 a
 dove
 and
 it
 abode
 upon
 him
 And
 I
 knew
 him
 not
 but
 he
 that
 sent
 me
 to
 baptize
 with
 water
 the
 same
 said
 unto
 me
 Upon
 whom
 thou
 shalt
 see
 the
 spirit
 descending
 and
 remaining
 on
 him
 the
 same
 is
 he
 which
 baptizeth
 with
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 And
 I
 saw
 and
 bare
 record
 that
 this
 is
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 On
 the
 day
 following
 that
 of
 the
 utterance
 last
 quoted
 John
 repeated
 his
 testimony
 to
 two
 of
 his
 disciples
 or
 followers
 as
 Jesus
 passed
 saying
 again
 Behold
 the
 Lamb
 of
 God
 THE
 FIRST
 DISCIPLES
 OF
 JESUS
 Two
 of
 the
 Baptists
 followers
 specifically
 called
 disciples
 were
 with
 him
 when
 for
 the
 second
 time
 he
 expressly
 designated
 Jesus
 as
 the
 Lamb
 of
 God
 These
 were
 Andrew
 and
 John
 the
 latter
 came
 to
 be
 known
 in
 after
 years
 as
 the
 author
 of
 the
 fourth
 Gospel
 The
 first
 is
 mentioned
 by
 name
 while
 the
 narrator
 suppresses
 his
 own
 name
 as
 that
 of
 the
 second
 disciple
 Andrew
 and
 John
 were
 so
 impressed
 by
 the
 Baptists
 testimony
 that
 they
 immediately
 followed
 Jesus
 and
 He
 turning
 toward
 them
 asked
 What
 seek
 ye
 Possibly
 somewhat
 embarrassed
 by
 the
 question
 or
 with
 a
 real
 desire
 to
 learn
 where
 He
 might
 be
 found
 later
 they
 replied
 by
 another
 inquiry
 Rabbi
 where
 dwellest
 thou
 Their
 use
 of
 the
 title
 Rabbi
 was
 a
 mark
 of
 honor
 and
 respect
 to
 which
 Jesus
 did
 not
 demur
 His
 courteous
 reply
 to
 their
 question
 assured
 them
 that
 their
 presence
 was
 no
 unwelcome
 intrusion
 Come
 and
 see
 said
 He
 The
 two
 young
 men
 accompanied
 Him
 and
 remained
 with
 Him
 to
 learn
 more
 Andrew
 filled
 with
 wonder
 and
 joy
 over
 the
 interview
 so
 graciously
 accorded
 and
 thrilled
 with
 the
 spirit
 of
 testimony
 that
 had
 been
 enkindled
 within
 his
 soul
 hastened
 to
 seek
 his
 brother
 Simon
 to
 whom
 he
 said
 We
 have
 found
 the
 Messias
 He
 brought
 Simon
 to
 see
 and
 hear
 for
 himself
 and
 Jesus
 looking
 upon
 Andrews
 brother
 called
 him
 by
 name
 and
 added
 an
 appellation
 of
 distinction
 by
 which
 he
 was
 destined
 to
 be
 known
 throughout
 all
 later
 history
 Thou
 art
 Simon
 the
 son
 of
 Jona
 thou
 shalt
 be
 called
 Cephas
 The
 new
 name
 thus
 bestowed
 is
 the
 Aramaic
 or
 SyroChaldaic
 equivalent
 of
 the
 Greek
 Petros
 and
 of
 the
 present
 English
 Peter
 meaning
 a
 stone
 On
 the
 following
 day
 Jesus
 set
 out
 for
 Galilee
 possibly
 accompanied
 by
 some
 or
 all
 of
 his
 newlymade
 disciples
 and
 on
 the
 way
 He
 found
 a
 man
 named
 Philip
 in
 whom
 He
 recognized
 another
 choice
 son
 of
 Israel
 Unto
 Philip
 He
 said
 Follow
 me
 It
 was
 customary
 with
 rabbis
 and
 other
 teachers
 of
 that
 time
 to
 strive
 for
 popularity
 that
 many
 might
 be
 drawn
 to
 them
 to
 sit
 at
 their
 feet
 and
 be
 known
 as
 their
 disciples
 Jesus
 however
 selected
 His
 own
 immediate
 associates
 and
 as
 He
 found
 them
 and
 discerned
 in
 them
 the
 spirits
 who
 in
 their
 preexistent
 state
 had
 been
 chosen
 for
 the
 earthly
 mission
 of
 the
 apostleship
 He
 summoned
 them
 They
 were
 the
 servants
 He
 was
 the
 Master
 Philip
 soon
 found
 his
 friend
 Nathanael
 to
 whom
 he
 testified
 that
 He
 of
 whom
 Moses
 and
 the
 prophets
 had
 written
 had
 at
 last
 been
 found
 and
 that
 He
 was
 none
 other
 than
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 Nathanael
 as
 his
 later
 history
 demonstrates
 was
 a
 righteous
 man
 earnest
 in
 his
 hope
 and
 expectation
 of
 the
 Messiah
 yet
 seemingly
 imbued
 with
 the
 belief
 common
 throughout
 Jewrythat
 the
 Christ
 was
 to
 come
 in
 royal
 state
 as
 seemed
 befitting
 the
 Son
 of
 David
 The
 mention
 of
 such
 a
 One
 coming
 from
 Nazareth
 the
 reputed
 son
 of
 a
 humble
 carpenter
 provoked
 wonder
 if
 not
 incredulity
 in
 the
 guileless
 mind
 of
 Nathanael
 and
 he
 exclaimed
 Can
 there
 any
 good
 thing
 come
 out
 of
 Nazareth
 Philips
 answer
 was
 a
 repetition
 of
 Christs
 words
 to
 Andrew
 and
 JohnCome
 and
 see
 Nathanael
 left
 his
 seat
 under
 the
 fig
 tree
 where
 Philip
 had
 found
 him
 and
 went
 to
 see
 for
 himself
 As
 he
 approached
 Jesus
 said
 Behold
 an
 Israelite
 indeed
 in
 whom
 is
 no
 guile
 Nathanael
 saw
 that
 Jesus
 could
 read
 his
 mind
 and
 asked
 in
 surprize
 Whence
 knowest
 thou
 me
 In
 reply
 Jesus
 showed
 even
 greater
 powers
 of
 penetration
 and
 perception
 under
 conditions
 that
 made
 ordinary
 observation
 unlikely
 if
 not
 impossible
 Before
 that
 Philip
 called
 thee
 when
 thou
 wast
 under
 the
 fig
 tree
 I
 saw
 thee
 Nathanael
 replied
 with
 conviction
 Rabbi
 thou
 art
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 thou
 art
 the
 King
 of
 Israel
 Earnest
 as
 the
 mans
 testimony
 was
 it
 rested
 mainly
 on
 his
 recognition
 of
 what
 he
 took
 to
 be
 a
 supernatural
 power
 in
 Jesus
 our
 Lord
 assured
 him
 that
 he
 should
 see
 yet
 greater
 things
 And
 he
 saith
 unto
 him
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Hereafter
 ye
 shall
 see
 heaven
 open
 and
 the
 angels
 of
 God
 ascending
 and
 descending
 upon
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 THE
 SON
 OF
 MAN
 In
 the
 promise
 and
 prediction
 made
 by
 Christ
 to
 Nathanael
 we
 find
 the
 significant
 titleThe
 Son
 of
 Manappearing
 for
 the
 first
 time
 chronologically
 speaking
 in
 the
 New
 Testament
 It
 recurs
 however
 about
 forty
 times
 excluding
 repetitions
 in
 parallel
 accounts
 in
 the
 several
 Gospels
 In
 each
 of
 these
 passages
 it
 is
 used
 by
 the
 Savior
 distinctively
 to
 designate
 Himself
 In
 three
 other
 instances
 the
 title
 appears
 in
 the
 New
 Testament
 outside
 the
 Gospels
 and
 in
 each
 case
 it
 is
 applied
 to
 the
 Christ
 with
 specific
 reference
 to
 His
 exalted
 attributes
 as
 Lord
 and
 God
 In
 the
 Old
 Testament
 the
 phrase
 son
 of
 man
 occurs
 in
 ordinary
 usage
 denoting
 any
 human
 son
 and
 it
 appears
 over
 ninety
 times
 as
 an
 appellation
 by
 which
 Jehovah
 addressed
 Ezekiel
 though
 it
 is
 never
 applied
 by
 the
 prophet
 to
 himself
 The
 context
 of
 the
 passages
 in
 which
 Ezekiel
 is
 addressed
 as
 son
 of
 man
 indicates
 the
 divine
 intention
 of
 emphasizing
 the
 human
 status
 of
 the
 prophet
 as
 contrasted
 with
 the
 divinity
 of
 Jehovah
 The
 title
 is
 used
 in
 connection
 with
 the
 record
 of
 Daniels
 vision
 in
 which
 was
 revealed
 the
 consummation
 yet
 future
 when
 Adamthe
 Ancient
 of
 Daysshall
 sit
 to
 judge
 his
 posterity
 on
 which
 great
 occasion
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 is
 to
 appear
 and
 receive
 a
 dominion
 that
 shall
 be
 everlasting
 transcendently
 superior
 to
 that
 of
 the
 Ancient
 of
 Days
 and
 embracing
 every
 people
 and
 nation
 all
 of
 whom
 shall
 serve
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 In
 applying
 the
 designation
 to
 Himself
 the
 Lord
 invariably
 uses
 the
 definite
 article
 The
 Son
 of
 Man
 was
 and
 is
 specifically
 and
 exclusively
 Jesus
 Christ
 While
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 solemn
 certainty
 He
 was
 the
 only
 male
 human
 being
 from
 Adam
 down
 who
 was
 not
 the
 son
 of
 a
 mortal
 man
 He
 used
 the
 title
 in
 a
 way
 to
 conclusively
 demonstrate
 that
 it
 was
 peculiarly
 and
 solely
 His
 own
 It
 is
 plainly
 evident
 that
 the
 expression
 is
 fraught
 with
 a
 meaning
 beyond
 that
 conveyed
 by
 the
 words
 in
 common
 usage
 The
 distinguishing
 appellation
 has
 been
 construed
 by
 many
 to
 indicate
 our
 Lords
 humble
 station
 as
 a
 mortal
 and
 to
 connote
 that
 He
 stood
 as
 the
 type
 of
 humanity
 holding
 a
 particular
 and
 unique
 relationship
 to
 the
 entire
 human
 family
 There
 is
 however
 a
 more
 profound
 significance
 attaching
 to
 the
 Lords
 use
 of
 the
 title
 The
 Son
 of
 Man
 and
 this
 lies
 in
 the
 fact
 that
 He
 knew
 His
 Father
 to
 be
 the
 one
 and
 only
 supremely
 exalted
 Man
 whose
 Son
 Jesus
 was
 both
 in
 spirit
 and
 in
 bodythe
 Firstborn
 among
 all
 the
 spiritchildren
 of
 the
 Father
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 in
 the
 fleshand
 therefore
 in
 sense
 applicable
 to
 Himself
 alone
 He
 was
 and
 is
 the
 Son
 of
 the
 Man
 of
 Holiness
 Elohim
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 In
 His
 distinctive
 titles
 of
 Sonship
 Jesus
 expressed
 His
 spiritual
 and
 bodily
 descent
 from
 and
 His
 filial
 submission
 to
 that
 exalted
 Father
 As
 revealed
 to
 Enoch
 the
 Seer
 Man
 of
 Holiness
 is
 one
 of
 the
 names
 by
 which
 God
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 is
 known
 and
 the
 name
 of
 his
 Only
 Begotten
 is
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 even
 Jesus
 Christ
 We
 learn
 further
 that
 the
 Father
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 thus
 proclaimed
 Himself
 to
 Enoch
 Behold
 I
 am
 God
 Man
 of
 Holiness
 is
 my
 name
 Man
 of
 Counsel
 is
 my
 name
 and
 Endless
 and
 Eternal
 is
 my
 name
 also
 The
 Son
 of
 Man
 is
 in
 great
 measure
 synonymous
 with
 The
 Son
 of
 God
 as
 a
 title
 denoting
 divinity
 glory
 and
 exaltation
 for
 the
 Man
 of
 Holiness
 whose
 Son
 Jesus
 Christ
 reverently
 acknowledges
 Himself
 to
 be
 is
 God
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 THE
 MIRACLE
 AT
 CANA
 IN
 GALILEE
 Soon
 after
 the
 arrival
 of
 Jesus
 in
 Galilee
 we
 find
 Him
 and
 His
 little
 company
 of
 disciples
 at
 a
 marriage
 party
 in
 Cana
 a
 neighboring
 town
 to
 Nazareth
 The
 mother
 of
 Jesus
 was
 at
 the
 feast
 and
 for
 some
 reason
 not
 explained
 in
 Johns
 narrative
 she
 manifested
 concern
 and
 personal
 responsibility
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 providing
 for
 the
 guests
 Evidently
 her
 position
 was
 different
 from
 that
 of
 one
 present
 by
 ordinary
 invitation
 Whether
 this
 circumstance
 indicates
 the
 marriage
 to
 have
 been
 that
 of
 one
 of
 her
 own
 immediate
 family
 or
 some
 more
 distant
 relative
 we
 are
 not
 informed
 It
 was
 customary
 to
 provide
 at
 wedding
 feasts
 a
 sufficiency
 of
 wine
 the
 pure
 though
 weak
 product
 of
 the
 local
 vineyards
 which
 was
 the
 ordinary
 table
 beverage
 of
 the
 time
 On
 this
 occasion
 the
 supply
 of
 wine
 was
 exhausted
 and
 Mary
 told
 Jesus
 of
 the
 deficiency
 Said
 He
 Woman
 what
 have
 I
 to
 do
 with
 thee
 mine
 hour
 is
 not
 yet
 come
 The
 noun
 of
 address
 Woman
 as
 applied
 by
 a
 son
 to
 his
 mother
 may
 sound
 to
 our
 ears
 somewhat
 harsh
 if
 not
 disrespectful
 but
 its
 use
 was
 really
 an
 expression
 of
 opposite
 import
 To
 every
 son
 the
 mother
 ought
 to
 be
 preeminently
 the
 woman
 of
 women
 she
 is
 the
 one
 woman
 in
 the
 world
 to
 whom
 the
 son
 owes
 his
 earthly
 existence
 and
 though
 the
 title
 Mother
 belongs
 to
 every
 woman
 who
 has
 earned
 the
 honors
 of
 maternity
 yet
 to
 no
 child
 is
 there
 more
 than
 one
 woman
 whom
 by
 natural
 right
 he
 can
 address
 by
 that
 title
 of
 respectful
 acknowledgment
 When
 in
 the
 last
 dread
 scenes
 of
 His
 mortal
 experience
 Christ
 hung
 in
 dying
 agony
 upon
 the
 cross
 He
 looked
 down
 upon
 the
 weeping
 Mary
 His
 mother
 and
 commended
 her
 to
 the
 care
 of
 the
 beloved
 apostle
 John
 with
 the
 words
 Woman
 behold
 thy
 son
 Can
 it
 be
 thought
 that
 in
 this
 supreme
 moment
 our
 Lords
 concern
 for
 the
 mother
 from
 whom
 He
 was
 about
 to
 be
 separated
 by
 death
 was
 associated
 with
 any
 emotion
 other
 than
 that
 of
 honor
 tenderness
 and
 love
 Nevertheless
 His
 words
 to
 Mary
 at
 the
 marriage
 feast
 may
 have
 conveyed
 a
 gentle
 reminder
 of
 her
 position
 as
 the
 mother
 of
 a
 Being
 superior
 to
 herself
 even
 as
 on
 that
 earlier
 occasion
 when
 she
 had
 found
 her
 Boy
 Jesus
 in
 the
 temple
 He
 had
 brought
 home
 to
 her
 the
 fact
 that
 her
 jurisdiction
 over
 Him
 was
 not
 supreme
 The
 manner
 in
 which
 she
 told
 Him
 of
 the
 insufficiency
 of
 wine
 probably
 suggested
 an
 intimation
 that
 He
 use
 His
 more
 than
 human
 power
 and
 by
 such
 means
 supply
 the
 need
 It
 was
 not
 her
 function
 to
 direct
 or
 even
 to
 suggest
 the
 exercize
 of
 the
 power
 inherent
 in
 Him
 as
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 such
 had
 not
 been
 inherited
 from
 her
 What
 have
 I
 to
 do
 with
 thee
 He
 asked
 and
 added
 Mine
 hour
 is
 not
 yet
 come
 Here
 we
 find
 no
 disclaimer
 of
 the
 ability
 to
 do
 what
 she
 apparently
 wanted
 Him
 to
 do
 but
 the
 plain
 implication
 that
 He
 would
 act
 only
 when
 the
 time
 was
 right
 for
 the
 purpose
 and
 that
 He
 not
 she
 must
 decide
 when
 that
 time
 had
 come
 She
 understood
 His
 meaning
 in
 part
 at
 least
 and
 contented
 herself
 by
 instructing
 the
 servants
 to
 do
 whatsoever
 He
 directed
 Here
 again
 is
 evidence
 of
 her
 position
 of
 responsibility
 and
 domestic
 authority
 at
 the
 social
 gathering
 The
 time
 for
 His
 intervention
 soon
 arrived
 There
 stood
 within
 the
 place
 six
 water
 pots
 these
 He
 directed
 the
 servants
 to
 fill
 with
 water
 Then
 without
 audible
 command
 or
 formula
 of
 invocation
 as
 best
 we
 know
 He
 caused
 to
 be
 effected
 a
 transmutation
 within
 the
 pots
 and
 when
 the
 servants
 drew
 therefrom
 it
 was
 wine
 not
 water
 that
 issued
 At
 a
 Jewish
 social
 gathering
 such
 as
 was
 this
 wedding
 festival
 some
 one
 usually
 a
 relative
 of
 the
 host
 or
 hostess
 or
 some
 other
 one
 worthy
 of
 the
 honor
 was
 made
 governor
 of
 the
 feast
 or
 as
 we
 say
 in
 this
 day
 chairman
 or
 master
 of
 ceremonies
 To
 this
 functionary
 the
 new
 wine
 was
 first
 served
 and
 he
 calling
 the
 bridegroom
 who
 was
 the
 real
 host
 asked
 him
 why
 he
 had
 reserved
 his
 choice
 wine
 till
 the
 last
 when
 the
 usual
 custom
 was
 to
 serve
 the
 best
 at
 the
 beginning
 and
 the
 more
 ordinary
 later
 The
 immediate
 result
 of
 this
 the
 first
 recorded
 of
 our
 Lords
 miracles
 is
 thus
 tersely
 stated
 by
 the
 inspired
 evangelist
 This
 beginning
 of
 miracles
 did
 Jesus
 in
 Cana
 of
 Galilee
 and
 manifested
 forth
 his
 glory
 and
 his
 disciples
 believed
 on
 him
 The
 circumstances
 incident
 to
 the
 miraculous
 act
 are
 instructive
 to
 contemplate
 The
 presence
 of
 Jesus
 at
 the
 marriage
 and
 His
 contribution
 to
 the
 successful
 conduct
 of
 the
 feast
 set
 the
 seal
 of
 His
 approval
 upon
 the
 matrimonial
 relationship
 and
 upon
 the
 propriety
 of
 social
 entertainment
 He
 was
 neither
 a
 recluse
 nor
 an
 ascetic
 He
 moved
 among
 men
 eating
 and
 drinking
 as
 a
 natural
 normal
 Being
 On
 the
 occasion
 of
 the
 feast
 He
 recognized
 and
 heeded
 the
 demands
 of
 the
 liberal
 hospitality
 of
 the
 times
 and
 provided
 accordingly
 He
 who
 but
 a
 few
 days
 before
 had
 revolted
 at
 the
 tempters
 suggestion
 that
 He
 provide
 bread
 for
 His
 impoverished
 body
 now
 used
 His
 power
 to
 supply
 a
 luxury
 for
 others
 One
 effect
 of
 the
 miracle
 was
 to
 confirm
 the
 trust
 of
 those
 whose
 belief
 in
 Him
 as
 the
 Messiah
 was
 yet
 young
 and
 untried
 His
 disciples
 believed
 on
 him
 surely
 they
 had
 believed
 in
 some
 measure
 before
 otherwise
 they
 would
 not
 have
 followed
 Him
 but
 their
 belief
 was
 now
 strengthened
 and
 made
 to
 approach
 if
 indeed
 it
 did
 not
 attain
 the
 condition
 of
 abiding
 faith
 in
 their
 Lord
 The
 comparative
 privacy
 attending
 the
 manifestation
 is
 impressive
 the
 moral
 and
 spiritual
 effect
 was
 for
 the
 few
 the
 inauguration
 of
 the
 Lords
 ministry
 was
 not
 to
 be
 marked
 by
 public
 display
 MIRACLES
 IN
 GENERAL
 The
 act
 of
 transmutation
 whereby
 water
 became
 wine
 was
 plainly
 a
 miracle
 a
 phenomenon
 not
 susceptible
 of
 explanation
 far
 less
 of
 demonstration
 by
 what
 we
 consider
 the
 ordinary
 operation
 of
 natural
 law
 This
 was
 the
 beginning
 of
 His
 miracles
 or
 as
 expressed
 in
 the
 revized
 version
 of
 the
 New
 Testament
 his
 signs
 In
 many
 scriptures
 miracles
 are
 called
 signs
 as
 also
 wonders
 powers
 works
 wonderful
 works
 mighty
 works
 etc
 The
 spiritual
 effect
 of
 miracles
 would
 be
 unattained
 were
 the
 witnesses
 not
 caused
 to
 inwardly
 wonder
 marvel
 ponder
 and
 inquire
 mere
 surprize
 or
 amazement
 may
 be
 produced
 by
 deception
 and
 artful
 trickery
 Any
 miraculous
 manifestation
 of
 divine
 power
 would
 be
 futile
 as
 a
 means
 of
 spiritual
 effect
 were
 it
 unimpressive
 Moreover
 every
 miracle
 is
 a
 sign
 of
 Gods
 power
 and
 signs
 in
 this
 sense
 have
 been
 demanded
 of
 prophets
 who
 professed
 to
 speak
 by
 divine
 authority
 though
 such
 signs
 have
 not
 been
 given
 in
 all
 cases
 The
 Baptist
 was
 credited
 with
 no
 miracle
 though
 he
 was
 pronounced
 by
 the
 Christ
 as
 more
 than
 a
 prophet
 and
 the
 chronicles
 of
 some
 earlier
 prophets
 are
 devoid
 of
 all
 mention
 of
 miracles
 On
 the
 other
 hand
 Moses
 when
 commissioned
 to
 deliver
 Israel
 from
 Egypt
 was
 made
 to
 understand
 that
 the
 Egyptians
 would
 look
 for
 the
 testimony
 of
 miracles
 and
 he
 was
 abundantly
 empowered
 therefore
 Miracles
 cannot
 be
 in
 contravention
 of
 natural
 law
 but
 are
 wrought
 through
 the
 operation
 of
 laws
 not
 universally
 or
 commonly
 recognized
 Gravitation
 is
 everywhere
 operative
 but
 the
 local
 and
 special
 application
 of
 other
 agencies
 may
 appear
 to
 nullify
 itas
 by
 muscular
 effort
 or
 mechanical
 impulse
 a
 stone
 is
 lifted
 from
 the
 ground
 poised
 aloft
 or
 sent
 hurtling
 through
 space
 At
 every
 stage
 of
 the
 process
 however
 gravity
 is
 in
 full
 play
 though
 its
 effect
 is
 modified
 by
 that
 of
 other
 and
 locally
 superior
 energy
 The
 human
 sense
 of
 the
 miraculous
 wanes
 as
 comprehension
 of
 the
 operative
 process
 increases
 Achievements
 made
 possible
 by
 modern
 invention
 of
 telegraph
 and
 telephone
 with
 or
 without
 wires
 the
 transmutation
 of
 mechanical
 power
 into
 electricity
 with
 its
 manifold
 present
 applications
 and
 yet
 future
 possibilities
 the
 development
 of
 the
 gasoline
 motor
 the
 present
 accomplishments
 in
 aerial
 navigationthese
 are
 no
 longer
 miracles
 in
 mans
 estimation
 because
 they
 are
 all
 in
 some
 degree
 understood
 are
 controlled
 by
 human
 agency
 and
 moreover
 are
 continuous
 in
 their
 operation
 and
 not
 phenomenal
 We
 arbitrarily
 classify
 as
 miracles
 only
 such
 phenomena
 as
 are
 unusual
 special
 transitory
 and
 wrought
 by
 an
 agency
 beyond
 the
 power
 of
 mans
 control
 In
 a
 broader
 sense
 all
 nature
 is
 miracle
 Man
 has
 learned
 that
 by
 planting
 the
 seed
 of
 the
 grape
 in
 suitable
 soil
 and
 by
 due
 cultivation
 he
 may
 conduce
 to
 the
 growth
 of
 what
 shall
 be
 a
 mature
 and
 fruitful
 vine
 but
 is
 there
 no
 miracle
 even
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 inscrutable
 processes
 in
 that
 development
 Is
 there
 less
 of
 real
 miracle
 in
 the
 socalled
 natural
 course
 of
 plant
 developmentthe
 growth
 of
 root
 stem
 leaves
 and
 fruit
 with
 the
 final
 elaboration
 of
 the
 rich
 nectar
 of
 the
 vinethan
 there
 was
 in
 what
 appears
 supernatural
 in
 the
 transmutation
 of
 water
 into
 wine
 at
 Cana
 In
 the
 contemplation
 of
 the
 miracles
 wrought
 by
 Christ
 we
 must
 of
 necessity
 recognize
 the
 operation
 of
 a
 power
 transcending
 our
 present
 human
 understanding
 In
 this
 field
 science
 has
 not
 yet
 advanced
 far
 enough
 to
 analyze
 and
 explain
 To
 deny
 the
 actuality
 of
 miracles
 on
 the
 ground
 that
 because
 we
 cannot
 comprehend
 the
 means
 the
 reported
 results
 are
 fictitious
 is
 to
 arrogate
 to
 the
 human
 mind
 the
 attribute
 of
 omniscience
 by
 implying
 that
 what
 man
 cannot
 comprehend
 cannot
 be
 and
 that
 therefore
 he
 is
 able
 to
 comprehend
 all
 that
 is
 The
 miracles
 of
 record
 in
 the
 Gospels
 are
 as
 fully
 supported
 by
 evidence
 as
 are
 many
 of
 the
 historical
 events
 which
 call
 forth
 neither
 protest
 nor
 demand
 for
 further
 proof
 To
 the
 believer
 in
 the
 divinity
 of
 Christ
 the
 miracles
 are
 sufficiently
 attested
 to
 the
 unbeliever
 they
 appear
 but
 as
 myths
 and
 fables
 To
 comprehend
 the
 works
 of
 Christ
 one
 must
 know
 Him
 as
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 to
 the
 man
 who
 has
 not
 yet
 learned
 to
 know
 to
 the
 honest
 soul
 who
 would
 inquire
 after
 the
 Lord
 the
 invitation
 is
 ready

 Misunderstanding
 of
 Malachis
 PredictionIn
 the
 closing
 chapter
 of
 the
 compilation
 of
 scriptures
 known
 to
 us
 as
 the
 Old
 Testament
 the
 prophet
 Malachi
 thus
 describes
 a
 condition
 incident
 to
 the
 last
 days
 immediately
 preceding
 the
 second
 coming
 of
 Christ
 For
 behold
 the
 day
 cometh
 that
 shall
 burn
 as
 an
 oven
 and
 all
 the
 proud
 yea
 and
 all
 that
 do
 wickedly
 shall
 be
 stubble
 and
 the
 day
 that
 cometh
 shall
 burn
 them
 up
 saith
 the
 Lord
 of
 hosts
 that
 it
 shall
 leave
 them
 neither
 root
 nor
 branch
 But
 unto
 you
 that
 fear
 my
 name
 shall
 the
 Sun
 of
 righteousness
 arise
 with
 healing
 in
 his
 wings
 The
 fateful
 prophecy
 concludes
 with
 the
 following
 blessed
 and
 farreaching
 promise
 Behold
 I
 will
 send
 you
 Elijah
 the
 prophet
 before
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 great
 and
 dreadful
 day
 of
 the
 Lord
 and
 he
 shall
 turn
 the
 heart
 of
 the
 fathers
 to
 the
 children
 and
 the
 heart
 of
 the
 children
 to
 their
 fathers
 lest
 I
 come
 and
 smite
 the
 earth
 with
 a
 curse
 Malachi
 
 
 
 
 It
 has
 been
 held
 by
 theologians
 and
 Bible
 commentators
 that
 this
 prediction
 had
 reference
 to
 the
 birth
 and
 ministry
 of
 John
 the
 Baptist
 compare
 Matt
 
 
 Mark
 
 Luke
 
 upon
 whom
 rested
 the
 spirit
 and
 power
 of
 Elias
 Luke
 
 However
 we
 have
 no
 record
 of
 Elijah
 having
 ministered
 unto
 the
 Baptist
 and
 furthermore
 the
 latters
 ministry
 glorious
 though
 it
 was
 justifies
 no
 conclusion
 that
 in
 him
 did
 the
 prophecy
 find
 its
 full
 realization
 In
 addition
 it
 should
 be
 remembered
 that
 the
 Lords
 declaration
 through
 Malachi
 relative
 to
 the
 day
 of
 burning
 in
 which
 the
 wicked
 would
 be
 destroyed
 as
 stubble
 yet
 awaits
 fulfilment
 It
 is
 evident
 therefore
 that
 the
 commonly
 accepted
 interpretation
 is
 at
 fault
 and
 that
 we
 must
 look
 to
 a
 later
 date
 than
 the
 time
 of
 John
 for
 the
 fulfilment
 of
 Malachis
 prediction
 The
 later
 occasion
 has
 come
 it
 belongs
 to
 the
 present
 dispensation
 and
 marks
 the
 inauguration
 of
 a
 work
 specially
 reserved
 for
 the
 Church
 in
 these
 latter
 days
 In
 the
 course
 of
 a
 glorious
 manifestation
 to
 Joseph
 Smith
 and
 Oliver
 Cowdery
 in
 the
 temple
 at
 Kirtland
 Ohio
 April
 d
 
 there
 appeared
 unto
 them
 Elijah
 the
 prophet
 of
 old
 who
 had
 been
 taken
 from
 earth
 while
 still
 in
 the
 body
 He
 declared
 unto
 them
 Behold
 the
 time
 has
 fully
 come
 which
 was
 spoken
 of
 by
 the
 mouth
 of
 Malachi
 testifying
 that
 he
 Elijah
 should
 be
 sent
 before
 the
 great
 and
 dreadful
 day
 of
 the
 Lord
 come
 to
 turn
 the
 hearts
 of
 the
 fathers
 to
 the
 children
 and
 the
 children
 to
 the
 fathers
 lest
 the
 whole
 earth
 be
 smitten
 with
 a
 curse
 Therefore
 the
 keys
 of
 this
 dispensation
 are
 committed
 into
 your
 hands
 and
 by
 this
 ye
 may
 know
 that
 the
 great
 and
 dreadful
 day
 of
 the
 Lord
 is
 near

 The
 Sign
 of
 the
 DoveJohn
 the

 the
 privilege
 of
 beholding
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 descend
 in
 the
 form
 of
 a
 dove
 or
 rather
 in
 the
 sign
 of
 the
 dove

 The

 of
 the
 dove
 was
 instituted
 before

 creation
 of
 the
 world
 a
 witness
 for
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 and
 the
 devil
 cannot
 come
 in
 the
 sign
 of
 a
 dove
 The
 Holy
 Ghost
 is
 a
 personage
 and
 is
 in
 the
 form
 of
 a
 personage
 It
 does
 not
 confine
 itself
 to
 the
 form
 of
 the
 dove
 but
 in
 sign
 of
 the
 dove
 The
 Holy
 Ghost
 cannot
 be
 transformed
 into
 a
 dove
 but
 the
 sign
 of
 a
 dove
 was
 given
 to
 John
 to
 signify
 the
 truth
 of
 the
 deed
 as

 is
 an
 emblem
 or
 token

 truth

 The
 Testimony
 of
 John
 the
 BaptistObserve
 that
 the
 Baptists
 testimony
 to
 the
 divinity
 of
 Christs
 mission
 is
 recorded
 as
 having
 been
 given
 after
 the
 period
 of
 our
 Lords
 fortyday
 fast
 and
 temptations
 and
 therefore
 approximately
 six
 weeks
 subsequent
 to
 the
 baptism
 of
 Jesus
 To
 the
 deputation
 of
 priests
 and
 Levites
 of
 the
 Pharisaic
 party
 who
 visited
 him
 by
 direction
 of
 the
 rulers
 probably
 by
 appointment
 from
 the
 Sanhedrin
 John
 after
 disavowing
 that
 he
 was
 the
 Christ
 or
 any
 one
 of
 the
 prophets
 specified
 in
 the
 inquiry
 said
 There
 standeth
 one
 among
 you
 whom
 ye
 know
 not
 he
 it
 is
 who
 coming
 after
 me
 is
 preferred
 before
 me
 On
 the
 next
 day
 and
 again
 on
 the
 day
 following
 that
 he
 bore
 public
 testimony
 to
 Jesus
 as
 the
 Lamb
 of
 God
 and
 on
 the
 third
 day
 after
 the
 visit
 of
 the
 priests
 and
 Levites
 to
 John
 Jesus
 started
 on
 the
 journey
 to
 Galilee
 John
 
 Johns
 use
 of
 the
 designation
 Lamb
 of
 God
 implied
 his
 conception
 of
 the
 Messiah
 as
 One
 appointed
 for
 sacrifice

 his
 use
 of
 the
 term
 is

 The
 Attitude
 of
 Science
 Towards
 Miracles
 is
 the
 subject
 of
 a
 valuable
 article
 by

 of

 Victoria

 Society

 This

 Prize
 Essay
 for
 
 After
 a
 lengthy
 analytical
 treatment
 of
 his
 subject
 the
 author
 presents
 the
 following
 summation
 which
 was
 concurred
 in
 by
 those
 who
 took
 part
 in
 the
 ensuing
 discussions
 We
 here
 complete
 our
 scientific
 investigation
 of
 Bible
 Miracles
 It
 has
 embraced
 
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 phenomenon
 
 the
 conditions
 under
 which
 it
 is
 alleged
 to
 have
 occurred
 
 the
 character
 of
 the
 testimony
 to
 its
 occurrence
 To
 the
 inquiryWere
 the
 Bible
 miracles
 probable
 science
 answers
 in
 the
 affirmative
 To
 the
 further
 inquiryDid
 they
 actually
 occur
 the
 answer
 of
 science
 is
 again
 and
 very
 emphatically
 in
 the
 affirmative
 If
 we
 liken
 them
 to
 gold
 she
 has
 made
 her
 assay
 and
 says
 the
 gold
 is
 pure
 Or
 the
 Bible
 miracles
 may
 be
 compared
 to
 a
 string
 of
 pearls
 If
 science
 seeks
 to
 know
 whether
 the
 pearls
 are
 genuine
 she
 may
 apply
 chemical
 and
 other
 tests
 to
 the
 examination
 of
 their
 character
 she
 may
 search
 into
 the
 conditions
 and
 circumstances
 in
 which
 the
 alleged
 pearls
 were
 found
 Were
 they
 first
 found
 in
 an
 oyster
 or
 in
 some
 manufacturing
 laboratory
 And
 she
 may
 investigate
 the
 testimony
 of
 experts
 Should
 the
 result
 of
 any
 one
 of
 these
 examinations
 affirm
 the
 genuineness
 of
 the
 pearls
 science
 will
 be
 slow
 to
 believe
 that
 they
 are
 paste
 if
 all
 the
 results
 declare
 their
 genuineness
 science
 will
 not
 hesitate
 to
 say
 that
 they
 are
 true
 pearls
 This
 as
 we
 have
 seen
 is
 the
 case
 of
 the
 Bible
 miracles
 Science
 therefore
 affirms
 their
 actual
 occurrence
 
 The
 Testimony
 of
 MiraclesThe
 Saviors
 promise
 in
 a
 former
 day
 Mark
 
 as
 in
 the
 present
 dispensation
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 is
 definite
 to
 the
 effect
 that
 specified
 gifts
 of
 the
 Spirit
 are
 to
 follow
 the
 believer
 as
 signs
 of
 divine
 favor
 The
 possession
 and
 exercize
 of
 such
 gifts
 may
 be
 taken
 therefore
 as
 essential
 features
 of
 the
 Church
 of
 Christ
 Nevertheless
 we
 are
 not
 justified
 in
 regarding
 the
 evidence
 of
 miracles
 as
 infallible
 testimony
 of
 authority
 from
 heaven
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 the
 scriptures
 furnish
 abundant
 proof
 that
 spiritual
 powers
 of
 the
 baser
 sort
 have
 wrought
 miracles
 and
 will
 continue
 so
 to
 do
 to
 the
 deceiving
 of
 many
 who
 lack
 discernment
 If
 miracles
 be
 accepted
 as
 infallible
 evidence
 of
 godly
 power
 the
 magicians
 of
 Egypt
 through
 the
 wonders
 which
 they
 accomplished
 in
 opposition
 to
 the
 ordained
 plan
 for
 Israels
 deliverance
 have
 as
 good
 a
 claim
 to
 our
 respect
 as
 has
 Moses
 Exo
 
 John
 the
 Revelator
 saw
 in
 vision
 a
 wicked
 power
 working
 miracles
 and
 thereby
 deceiving
 many
 doing
 great
 wonders
 even
 bringing
 fire
 from
 heaven
 Rev
 
 Again
 he
 saw
 three
 unclean
 spirits
 whom
 he
 knew
 to
 be
 the
 spirits
 of
 devils
 working
 miracles
 Rev
 
 Consider
 in
 connection
 with
 this
 the
 prediction
 made
 by
 the
 SaviorThere
 shall
 arise
 false
 Christs
 and
 false
 prophets
 and
 shall
 show
 great
 signs
 and
 wonders
 insomuch
 that
 if
 it
 were
 possible
 they
 shall
 deceive
 the
 very
 elect
 Matt
 
 The
 invalidity
 of
 miracles
 as
 a
 proof
 of
 righteousness
 is
 indicated
 in
 an
 utterance
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 regarding
 the
 events
 of
 the
 great
 judgmentMany
 will
 say
 to
 me
 in
 that
 day
 Lord

 we
 not
 prophesied

 CHAPTER
 
 EARLY
 INCIDENTS
 IN
 OUR
 LORDS
 PUBLIC
 MINISTRY
 FIRST
 CLEARING
 OF
 THE
 TEMPLE
 Soon
 after
 the
 marriage
 festivities
 in
 Cana
 Jesus
 accompanied
 by
 His
 disciples
 as
 also
 by
 His
 mother
 and
 other
 members
 of
 the
 family
 went
 to
 Capernaum
 a
 town
 pleasantly
 situated
 near
 the
 northerly
 end
 of
 the
 Sea
 of
 Galilee
 or
 Lake
 of
 Gennesaret
 and
 the
 scene
 of
 many
 of
 our
 Lords
 miraculous
 works
 indeed
 it
 came
 to
 be
 known
 as
 His
 own
 city
 Because
 of
 the
 unbelief
 of
 its
 people
 it
 became
 a
 subject
 of
 lamentation
 to
 Jesus
 when
 in
 sorrow
 He
 prefigured
 the
 judgment
 that
 would
 befall
 the
 place
 The
 exact
 site
 of
 the
 city
 is
 at
 present
 unknown
 On
 this
 occasion
 Jesus
 tarried
 but
 a
 few
 days
 at
 Capernaum
 for
 the
 time
 of
 the
 annual
 Passover
 was
 near
 and
 in
 compliance
 with
 Jewish
 law
 and
 custom
 He
 went
 up
 to
 Jerusalem
 The
 synoptic
 Gospels
 which
 are
 primarily
 devoted
 to
 the
 labors
 of
 Christ
 in
 Galilee
 contain
 no
 mention
 of
 His
 attendance
 at
 the
 paschal
 festival
 between
 His
 twelfth
 year
 and
 the
 time
 of
 His
 death
 to
 John
 alone
 are
 we
 indebted
 for
 the
 record
 of
 this
 visit
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 Christs
 public
 ministry
 It
 is
 not
 improbable
 that
 Jesus
 had
 been
 present
 at
 other
 Passovers
 during
 the
 eighteen
 years
 over
 which
 the
 evangelists
 pass
 in
 complete
 and
 reverent
 silence
 but
 at
 any
 or
 all
 such
 earlier
 visits
 He
 not
 being
 thirty
 years
 old
 could
 not
 have
 assumed
 the
 right
 or
 privilege
 of
 a
 teacher
 without
 contravening
 established
 customs
 It
 is
 worth
 our
 attention
 to
 note
 that
 on
 this
 the
 first
 recorded
 appearance
 of
 Jesus
 in
 the
 temple
 subsequent
 to
 His
 visit
 as
 a
 Boy
 He
 should
 resume
 His
 Fathers
 business
 where
 He
 had
 before
 been
 engaged
 It
 was
 in
 His
 Fathers
 service
 that
 He
 had
 been
 found
 in
 discussion
 with
 the
 doctors
 of
 the
 law
 and
 in
 His
 Fathers
 cause
 He
 was
 impelled
 to
 action
 on
 this
 later
 occasion
 The
 multitudinous
 and
 mixed
 attendance
 at
 the
 Passover
 celebration
 has
 already
 received
 passing
 mention
 some
 of
 the
 unseemly
 customs
 that
 prevailed
 are
 to
 be
 held
 in
 mind
 The
 law
 of
 Moses
 had
 been
 supplemented
 by
 a
 cumulative
 array
 of
 rules
 and
 the
 rigidly
 enforced
 requirements
 as
 to
 sacrifices
 and
 tribute
 had
 given
 rise
 to
 a
 system
 of
 sale
 and
 barter
 within
 the
 sacred
 precincts
 of
 the
 House
 of
 the
 Lord
 In
 the
 outer
 courts
 were
 stalls
 of
 oxen
 pens
 of
 sheep
 cages
 of
 doves
 and
 pigeons
 and
 the
 ceremonial
 fitness
 of
 these
 sacrificial
 victims
 was
 cried
 aloud
 by
 the
 sellers
 and
 charged
 for
 in
 full
 measure
 It
 was
 the
 custom
 also
 to
 pay
 the
 yearly
 poll
 tribute
 of
 the
 sanctuary
 at
 this
 seasonthe
 ransom
 offering
 required
 of
 every
 male
 in
 Israel
 and
 amounting
 to
 half
 a
 shekel
 for
 each
 irrespective
 of
 his
 relative
 poverty
 or
 wealth
 This
 was
 to
 be
 paid
 after
 the
 shekel
 of
 the
 sanctuary
 which
 limitation
 as
 rabbis
 had
 ruled
 meant
 payment
 in
 temple
 coin
 Ordinary
 money
 varieties
 of
 which
 bore
 effigies
 and
 inscriptions
 of
 heathen
 import
 was
 not
 acceptable
 and
 as
 a
 result
 moneychangers
 plied
 a
 thriving
 trade
 on
 the
 temple
 grounds
 Righteously
 indignant
 at
 what
 He
 beheld
 zealous
 for
 the
 sanctity
 of
 His
 Fathers
 House
 Jesus
 essayed
 to
 clear
 the
 place
 and
 pausing
 not
 for
 argument
 in
 words
 He
 promptly
 applied
 physical
 force
 almost
 approaching
 violencethe
 one
 form
 of
 figurative
 language
 that
 those
 corrupt
 barterers
 for
 pelf
 could
 best
 understand
 Hastily
 improvizing
 a
 whip
 of
 small
 cords
 He
 laid
 about
 Him
 on
 every
 side
 liberating
 and
 driving
 out
 sheep
 oxen
 and
 human
 traffickers
 upsetting
 the
 tables
 of
 the
 exchangers
 and
 pouring
 out
 their
 heterogeneous
 accumulations
 of
 coin
 With
 tender
 regard
 for
 the
 imprisoned
 and
 helpless
 birds
 He
 refrained
 from
 assaulting
 their
 cages
 but
 to
 their
 owners
 He
 said
 Take
 these
 things
 hence
 and
 to
 all
 the
 greedy
 traders
 He
 thundered
 forth
 a
 command
 that
 made
 them
 quail
 Make
 not
 my
 Fathers
 house
 an
 house
 of
 merchandise
 His
 disciples
 saw
 in
 the
 incident
 a
 realization
 of
 the
 psalmists
 line
 The
 zeal
 of
 thine
 house
 hath
 eaten
 me
 up
 The
 Jews
 by
 which
 term
 we
 mean
 the
 priestly
 officials
 and
 rulers
 of
 the
 people
 dared
 not
 protest
 this
 vigorous
 action
 on
 the
 ground
 of
 unrighteousness
 they
 learned
 in
 the
 law
 stood
 selfconvicted
 of
 corruption
 avarice
 and
 of
 personal
 responsibility
 for
 the
 temples
 defilement
 That
 the
 sacred
 premises
 were
 in
 sore
 need
 of
 a
 cleansing
 they
 all
 knew
 the
 one
 point
 upon
 which
 they
 dared
 to
 question
 the
 Cleanser
 was
 as
 to
 why
 He
 should
 thus
 take
 to
 Himself
 the
 doing
 of
 what
 was
 their
 duty
 They
 practically
 submitted
 to
 His
 sweeping
 intervention
 as
 that
 of
 one
 whose
 possible
 investiture
 of
 authority
 they
 might
 be
 yet
 compelled
 to
 acknowledge
 Their
 tentative
 submission
 was
 based
 on
 fear
 and
 that
 in
 turn
 upon
 their
 sinconvicted
 consciences
 Christ
 prevailed
 over
 those
 haggling
 Jews
 by
 virtue
 of
 the
 eternal
 principle
 that
 right
 is
 mightier
 than
 wrong
 and
 of
 the
 psychological
 fact
 that
 consciousness
 of
 guilt
 robs
 the
 culprit
 of
 valor
 when
 the
 imminence
 of
 just
 retribution
 is
 apparent
 to
 his
 soul
 Yet
 fearful
 lest
 He
 should
 prove
 to
 be
 a
 prophet
 with
 power
 such
 as
 no
 living
 priest
 or
 rabbi
 even
 professed
 to
 be
 they
 timidly
 asked
 for
 credentials
 of
 His
 authorityWhat
 sign
 shewest
 thou
 unto
 us
 seeing
 that
 thou
 doest
 these
 things
 Curtly
 and
 with
 scant
 respect
 for
 this
 demand
 so
 common
 to
 wicked
 and
 adulterous
 men
 Jesus
 replied
 Destroy
 this
 temple
 and
 in
 three
 days
 I
 will
 raise
 it
 up
 Blinded
 by
 their
 own
 craft
 unwilling
 to
 acknowledge
 the
 Lords
 authority
 yet
 fearful
 of
 the
 possibility
 that
 they
 were
 opposing
 one
 who
 had
 the
 right
 to
 act
 the
 perturbed
 officials
 found
 in
 the
 words
 of
 Jesus
 reference
 to
 the
 imposing
 temple
 of
 masonry
 within
 whose
 walls
 they
 stood
 They
 took
 courage
 this
 strange
 Galilean
 who
 openly
 flouted
 their
 authority
 spoke
 irreverently
 of
 their
 temple
 the
 visible
 expression
 of
 the
 profession
 they
 so
 proudly
 flaunted
 in
 wordsthat
 they
 were
 children
 of
 the
 covenant
 worshipers
 of
 the
 true
 and
 living
 God
 and
 hence
 superior
 to
 all
 heathen
 and
 pagan
 peoples
 With
 seeming
 indignation
 they
 rejoined
 Forty
 and
 six
 years
 was
 this
 temple
 in
 building
 and
 wilt
 thou
 rear
 it
 up
 in
 three
 days
 Though
 frustrated
 in
 their
 desire
 to
 arouse
 popular
 indignation
 against
 Jesus
 at
 this
 time
 the
 Jews
 refused
 to
 forget
 or
 forgive
 His
 words
 When
 afterward
 He
 stood
 an
 undefended
 prisoner
 undergoing
 an
 illegal
 pretense
 of
 trial
 before
 a
 sinimpeached
 court
 the
 blackest
 perjury
 uttered
 against
 Him
 was
 that
 of
 the
 false
 witnesses
 who
 testified
 We
 heard
 him
 say
 I
 will
 destroy
 this
 temple
 that
 is
 made
 with
 hands
 and
 within
 three
 days
 I
 will
 build
 another
 made
 without
 hands
 And
 while
 He
 hung
 in
 mortal
 suffering
 the
 scoffers
 who
 passed
 by
 the
 cross
 wagged
 their
 heads
 and
 taunted
 the
 dying
 Christ
 with
 Ah
 thou
 that
 destroyest
 the
 temple
 and
 buildest
 it
 in
 three
 days
 save
 thyself
 and
 come
 down
 from
 the
 cross
 Yet
 His
 words
 to
 the
 Jews
 who
 had
 demanded
 the
 credentials
 of
 a
 sign
 had
 no
 reference
 to
 the
 colossal
 Temple
 of
 Herod
 but
 to
 the
 sanctuary
 of
 His
 own
 body
 in
 which
 more
 literally
 than
 in
 the
 manbuilt
 Holy
 of
 Holies
 dwelt
 the
 ever
 living
 Spirit
 of
 the
 Eternal
 God
 The
 Father
 is
 in
 me
 was
 His
 doctrine
 He
 spake
 of
 the
 temple
 of
 His
 body
 the
 real
 tabernacle
 of
 the
 Most
 High
 This
 reference
 to
 the
 destruction
 of
 the
 temple
 of
 His
 body
 and
 the
 renewal
 thereof
 after
 three
 days
 is
 His
 first
 recorded
 prediction
 relating
 to
 His
 appointed
 death
 and
 resurrection
 Even
 the
 disciples
 did
 not
 comprehend
 the
 profound
 meaning
 of
 His
 words
 until
 after
 His
 resurrection
 from
 the
 dead
 then
 they
 remembered
 and
 understood
 The
 priestly
 Jews
 were
 not
 as
 dense
 as
 they
 appeared
 to
 be
 for
 we
 find
 them
 coming
 to
 Pilate
 while
 the
 body
 of
 the
 crucified
 Christ
 lay
 in
 the
 tomb
 saying
 Sir
 we
 remember
 that
 that
 deceiver
 said
 while
 he
 was
 yet
 alive
 After
 three
 days
 I
 will
 rise
 again
 Though
 we
 have
 many
 records
 of
 Christ
 having
 said
 that
 He
 would
 die
 and
 on
 the
 third
 day
 would
 rise
 again
 the
 plainest
 of
 such
 declarations
 were
 made
 to
 the
 apostles
 rather
 than
 openly
 to
 the
 public
 The
 Jews
 who
 waited
 upon
 Pilate
 almost
 certainly
 had
 in
 mind
 the
 utterance
 of
 Jesus
 when
 they
 had
 stood
 nonplussed
 before
 Him
 at
 the
 clearing
 of
 the
 temple
 courts
 Such
 an
 accomplishment
 as
 that
 of
 defying
 priestly
 usage
 and
 clearing
 the
 temple
 purlieus
 by
 force
 could
 not
 fail
 to
 impress
 with
 varied
 effect
 the
 people
 in
 attendance
 at
 the
 feast
 and
 they
 returning
 to
 their
 homes
 in
 distant
 and
 widely
 separated
 provinces
 would
 spread
 the
 fame
 of
 the
 courageous
 Galilean
 Prophet
 Many
 in
 Jerusalem
 believed
 on
 Him
 at
 the
 time
 mainly
 because
 they
 were
 attracted
 by
 the
 miracles
 He
 wrought
 but
 He
 refused
 to
 commit
 himself
 unto
 them
 realizing
 the
 insecure
 foundation
 of
 their
 professions
 Popular
 adulation
 was
 foreign
 to
 His
 purpose
 He
 wanted
 no
 motley
 following
 but
 would
 gather
 around
 Him
 such
 as
 received
 the
 testimony
 of
 His
 Messiahship
 from
 the
 Father
 He
 knew
 all
 men
 and
 needed
 not
 that
 any
 should
 testify
 of
 man
 for
 he
 knew
 what
 was
 in
 man
 The
 incident
 of
 Christs
 forcible
 clearing
 of
 the
 temple
 is
 a
 contradiction
 of
 the
 traditional
 conception
 of
 Him
 as
 of
 One
 so
 gentle
 and
 unassertive
 in
 demeanor
 as
 to
 appear
 unmanly
 Gentle
 He
 was
 and
 patient
 under
 affliction
 merciful
 and
 longsuffering
 in
 dealing
 with
 contrite
 sinners
 yet
 stern
 and
 inflexible
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 hypocrisy
 and
 unsparing
 in
 His
 denunciation
 of
 persistent
 evildoers
 His
 mood
 was
 adapted
 to
 the
 conditions
 to
 which
 He
 addressed
 Himself
 tender
 words
 of
 encouragement
 or
 burning
 expletives
 of
 righteous
 indignation
 issued
 with
 equal
 fluency
 from
 His
 lips
 His
 nature
 was
 no
 poetic
 conception
 of
 cherubic
 sweetness
 ever
 present
 but
 that
 of
 a
 Man
 with
 the
 emotions
 and
 passions
 essential
 to
 manhood
 and
 manliness
 He
 who
 often
 wept
 with
 compassion
 at
 other
 times
 evinced
 in
 word
 and
 action
 the
 righteous
 anger
 of
 a
 God
 But
 of
 all
 His
 passions
 however
 gently
 they
 rippled
 or
 strongly
 surged
 He
 was
 ever
 master
 Contrast
 the
 gentle
 Jesus
 moved
 to
 hospitable
 service
 by
 the
 needs
 of
 a
 festal
 party
 in
 Cana
 with
 the
 indignant
 Christ
 plying
 His
 whip
 and
 amidst
 commotion
 and
 turmoil
 of
 His
 own
 making
 driving
 cattle
 and
 men
 before
 Him
 as
 an
 unclean
 herd
 JESUS
 AND
 NICODEMUS
 That
 the
 wonderful
 deeds
 wrought
 by
 Christ
 at
 and
 about
 the
 time
 of
 this
 memorable
 Passover
 had
 led
 some
 of
 the
 learned
 in
 addition
 to
 many
 of
 the
 common
 people
 to
 believe
 in
 Him
 is
 evidenced
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 Nicodemus
 who
 was
 a
 Pharisee
 in
 profession
 and
 who
 occupied
 a
 high
 place
 as
 one
 of
 the
 rulers
 of
 the
 Jews
 came
 to
 Him
 on
 an
 errand
 of
 inquiry
 There
 is
 significance
 in
 the
 circumstance
 that
 this
 visit
 was
 made
 at
 night
 Apparently
 the
 man
 was
 impelled
 by
 a
 genuine
 desire
 to
 learn
 more
 of
 the
 Galilean
 whose
 works
 could
 not
 be
 ignored
 though
 pride
 of
 office
 and
 fear
 of
 possible
 suspicion
 that
 he
 had
 become
 attached
 to
 the
 new
 Prophet
 led
 him
 to
 veil
 his
 undertaking
 with
 privacy
 Addressing
 Jesus
 by
 the
 title
 he
 himself
 bore
 and
 which
 he
 regarded
 as
 one
 of
 honor
 and
 respect
 he
 said
 Rabbi
 we
 know
 that
 thou
 art
 a
 teacher
 come
 from
 God
 for
 no
 man
 can
 do
 these
 miracles
 that
 thou
 doest
 except
 God
 be
 with
 him
 Whether
 his
 use
 of
 the
 plural
 pronoun
 we
 indicates
 that
 he
 was
 sent
 by
 the
 Sanhedrin
 or
 by
 the
 society
 of
 Phariseesthe
 members
 of
 which
 were
 accustomed
 to
 so
 speak
 as
 representatives
 of
 the
 orderor
 was
 employed
 in
 the
 rhetorical
 sense
 as
 indicating
 himself
 alone
 is
 of
 little
 importance
 He
 acknowledged
 Jesus
 as
 a
 teacher
 come
 from
 God
 and
 gave
 reasons
 for
 so
 regarding
 Him
 Whatever
 of
 feeble
 faith
 might
 have
 been
 stirring
 in
 the
 heart
 of
 the
 man
 such
 was
 founded
 on
 the
 evidence
 of
 miracles
 supported
 mainly
 by
 the
 psychological
 effect
 of
 signs
 and
 wonders
 We
 must
 accord
 him
 credit
 for
 sincerity
 and
 honesty
 of
 purpose
 Without
 waiting
 for
 specific
 questions
 Jesus
 answered
 and
 said
 unto
 him
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 thee
 Except
 a
 man
 be
 born
 again
 he
 cannot
 see
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 Nicodemus
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 puzzled
 he
 asked
 how
 such
 a
 rejuvenation
 was
 possible
 How
 can
 a
 man
 be
 born
 when
 he
 is
 old
 can
 he
 enter
 the
 second
 time
 into
 his
 mothers
 womb
 and
 be
 born
 We
 do
 Nicodemus
 no
 injustice
 in
 assuming
 that
 he
 as
 a
 rabbi
 a
 man
 learned
 in
 the
 scriptures
 ought
 to
 have
 known
 that
 there
 was
 other
 meaning
 in
 the
 words
 of
 Jesus
 than
 that
 of
 a
 mortal
 literal
 birth
 Moreover
 were
 it
 possible
 that
 a
 man
 could
 be
 born
 a
 second
 time
 literally
 and
 in
 the
 flesh
 how
 could
 such
 a
 birth
 profit
 him
 in
 spiritual
 growth
 It
 would
 be
 but
 a
 reentrance
 on
 the
 stage
 of
 physical
 existence
 not
 an
 advancement
 The
 man
 knew
 that
 the
 figure
 of
 a
 new
 birth
 was
 common
 in
 the
 teachings
 of
 his
 day
 Every
 proselyte
 to
 Judaism
 was
 spoken
 of
 at
 the
 time
 of
 his
 conversion
 as
 one
 newborn
 The
 surprize
 manifested
 by
 Nicodemus
 was
 probably
 due
 in
 part
 at
 least
 to
 the
 universality
 of
 the
 requirement
 as
 announced
 by
 Christ
 Were
 the
 children
 of
 Abraham
 included
 The
 traditionalism
 of
 centuries
 was
 opposed
 to
 any
 such
 view
 Pagans
 had
 to
 be
 born
 again
 through
 a
 formal
 acceptance
 of
 Judaism
 if
 they
 would
 become
 even
 small
 sharers
 of
 the
 blessings
 that
 belonged
 as
 a
 heritage
 to
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 but
 Jesus
 seemed
 to
 treat
 all
 alike
 Jews
 and
 Gentiles
 heathen
 idolaters
 and
 the
 people
 who
 with
 their
 lips
 at
 least
 called
 Jehovah
 God
 Jesus
 repeated
 the
 declaration
 and
 with
 precision
 emphasizing
 by
 the
 impressive
 Verily
 verily
 the
 greatest
 lesson
 that
 had
 ever
 saluted
 the
 ears
 of
 this
 ruler
 in
 Israel
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 thee
 Except
 a
 man
 be
 born
 of
 water
 and
 of
 the
 Spirit
 he
 cannot
 enter
 into
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 That
 the
 new
 birth
 thus
 declared
 to
 be
 absolutely
 essential
 as
 a
 condition
 of
 entrance
 into
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 applicable
 to
 every
 man
 without
 limitation
 or
 qualification
 was
 a
 spiritual
 regeneration
 was
 next
 explained
 to
 the
 wondering
 rabbi
 That
 which
 is
 born
 of
 the
 flesh
 is
 flesh
 and
 that
 which
 is
 born
 of
 the
 Spirit
 is
 spirit
 Marvel
 not
 that
 I
 said
 unto
 thee
 Ye
 must
 be
 born
 again
 Still
 the
 learned
 Jew
 pondered
 yet
 failed
 to
 comprehend
 Possibly
 the
 sound
 of
 the
 night
 breeze
 was
 heard
 at
 that
 moment
 if
 so
 Jesus
 was
 but
 utilizing
 the
 incident
 as
 a
 skilful
 teacher
 would
 do
 to
 impress
 a
 lesson
 when
 He
 continued
 The
 wind
 bloweth
 where
 it
 listeth
 and
 thou
 hearest
 the
 sound
 thereof
 but
 canst
 not
 tell
 whence
 it
 cometh
 and
 whither
 it
 goeth
 so
 is
 every
 one
 that
 is
 born
 of
 the
 Spirit
 Plainly
 stated
 Nicodemus
 was
 given
 to
 understand
 that
 his
 worldly
 learning
 and
 official
 status
 availed
 him
 nothing
 in
 any
 effort
 to
 understand
 the
 things
 of
 God
 through
 the
 physical
 sense
 of
 hearing
 he
 knew
 that
 the
 wind
 blew
 by
 sight
 he
 could
 be
 informed
 of
 its
 passage
 yet
 what
 did
 he
 know
 of
 the
 ultimate
 cause
 of
 even
 this
 simple
 phenomenon
 If
 Nicodemus
 would
 really
 be
 instructed
 in
 spiritual
 matters
 he
 had
 to
 divest
 himself
 of
 the
 bias
 due
 to
 his
 professed
 knowledge
 of
 lesser
 things
 Rabbi
 and
 eminent
 Sanhedrist
 though
 he
 was
 there
 at
 the
 humble
 lodging
 of
 the
 Teacher
 from
 Galilee
 he
 was
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 a
 Master
 In
 the
 bewilderment
 of
 ignorance
 he
 asked
 How
 can
 these
 things
 be
 The
 reply
 must
 have
 been
 humbling
 if
 not
 humiliating
 to
 the
 man
 Art
 thou
 a
 master
 of
 Israel
 and
 knowest
 not
 these
 things
 Plainly
 a
 knowledge
 of
 some
 of
 the
 fundamental
 principles
 of
 the
 gospel
 had
 been
 before
 accessible
 Nicodemus
 was
 held
 in
 reproach
 for
 his
 lack
 of
 knowledge
 particularly
 as
 he
 was
 a
 teacher
 of
 the
 people
 Then
 our
 Lord
 graciously
 expounded
 at
 greater
 length
 testifying
 that
 He
 spoke
 from
 sure
 knowledge
 based
 upon
 what
 He
 had
 seen
 while
 Nicodemus
 and
 his
 fellows
 were
 unwilling
 to
 accept
 the
 witness
 of
 His
 words
 Furthermore
 Jesus
 averred
 His
 mission
 to
 be
 that
 of
 the
 Messiah
 and
 specifically
 foretold
 His
 death
 and
 the
 manner
 thereofthat
 He
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 must
 be
 lifted
 up
 even
 as
 Moses
 had
 lifted
 the
 serpent
 in
 the
 wilderness
 as
 a
 prototype
 whereby
 Israel
 might
 escape
 the
 fatal
 plague
 The
 purpose
 of
 the
 foreappointed
 death
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 was
 That
 whosoever
 believeth
 in
 him
 should
 not
 perish
 but
 have
 eternal
 life
 for
 to
 this
 end
 and
 out
 of
 His
 boundless
 love
 to
 man
 had
 the
 Father
 devoted
 His
 Only
 Begotten
 Son
 And
 further
 while
 it
 was
 true
 that
 in
 His
 mortal
 advent
 the
 Son
 had
 not
 come
 to
 sit
 as
 a
 judge
 but
 to
 teach
 persuade
 and
 save
 nevertheless
 condemnation
 would
 surely
 follow
 rejection
 of
 that
 Savior
 for
 light
 had
 come
 and
 wicked
 men
 avoided
 the
 light
 hating
 it
 in
 their
 preference
 for
 the
 darkness
 in
 which
 they
 hoped
 to
 hide
 their
 evil
 deeds
 Here
 again
 perhaps
 Nicodemus
 experienced
 a
 twinge
 of
 conscience
 for
 had
 not
 he
 been
 afraid
 to
 come
 in
 the
 light
 and
 had
 he
 not
 chosen
 the
 dark
 hours
 for
 his
 visit
 Our
 Lords
 concluding
 words
 combined
 both
 instruction
 and
 reproof
 But
 he
 that
 doeth
 truth
 cometh
 to
 the
 light
 that
 his
 deeds
 may
 be
 made
 manifest
 that
 they
 are
 wrought
 in
 God
 The
 narrative
 of
 this
 interview
 between
 Nicodemus
 and
 the
 Christ
 constitutes
 one
 of
 our
 most
 instructive
 and
 precious
 scriptures
 relating
 to
 the
 absolute
 necessity
 of
 unreserved
 compliance
 with
 the
 laws
 and
 ordinances
 of
 the
 gospel
 as
 the
 means
 indispensable
 to
 salvation
 Faith
 in
 Jesus
 Christ
 as
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 through
 whom
 alone
 men
 may
 gain
 eternal
 life
 the
 forsaking
 of
 sin
 by
 resolute
 turning
 away
 from
 the
 gross
 darkness
 of
 evil
 to
 the
 saving
 light
 of
 righteousness
 the
 unqualified
 requirement
 of
 a
 new
 birth
 through
 baptism
 in
 water
 and
 this
 of
 necessity
 by
 the
 mode
 of
 immersion
 since
 otherwise
 the
 figure
 of
 a
 birth
 would
 be
 meaningless
 and
 the
 completion
 of
 the
 new
 birth
 through
 baptism
 by
 the
 Spiritall
 these
 principles
 are
 taught
 herein
 in
 such
 simplicity
 and
 plainness
 as
 to
 make
 plausible
 no
 mans
 excuse
 for
 ignorance
 If
 Jesus
 and
 Nicodemus
 were
 the
 only
 persons
 present
 at
 the
 interview
 John
 the
 writer
 must
 have
 been
 informed
 thereof
 by
 one
 of
 the
 two
 As
 John
 was
 one
 of
 the
 early
 disciples
 afterward
 one
 of
 the
 apostles
 and
 as
 he
 was
 distinguished
 in
 the
 apostolic
 company
 by
 his
 close
 personal
 companionship
 with
 the
 Lord
 it
 is
 highly
 probable
 that
 he
 heard
 the
 account
 from
 the
 lips
 of
 Jesus
 It
 was
 evidently
 Johns
 purpose
 to
 record
 the
 great
 lesson
 of
 the
 occasion
 rather
 than
 to
 tell
 the
 circumstantial
 story
 The
 record
 begins
 and
 ends
 with
 equal
 abruptness
 unimportant
 incidents
 are
 omitted
 every
 line
 is
 of
 significance
 the
 writer
 fully
 realized
 the
 deep
 import
 of
 his
 subject
 and
 treated
 it
 accordingly
 Later
 mention
 of
 Nicodemus
 tends
 to
 confirm
 the
 estimate
 of
 the
 man
 as
 he
 appears
 in
 this
 meeting
 with
 Jesusthat
 of
 one
 who
 was
 conscious
 of
 a
 belief
 in
 the
 Christ
 but
 whose
 belief
 was
 never
 developed
 into
 such
 genuine
 and
 virile
 faith
 as
 would
 impel
 to
 acceptance
 and
 compliance
 irrespective
 of
 cost
 or
 consequence
 FROM
 CITY
 TO
 COUNTRY
 Leaving
 Jerusalem
 Jesus
 and
 His
 disciples
 went
 into
 the
 rural
 parts
 of
 Judea
 and
 there
 tarried
 doubtless
 preaching
 as
 opportunity
 was
 found
 or
 made
 and
 those
 who
 believed
 on
 Him
 were
 baptized
 The
 prominent
 note
 of
 His
 early
 public
 utterances
 was
 that
 of
 His
 forerunner
 in
 the
 wilderness
 Repent
 for
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 at
 hand
 The
 Baptist
 continued
 his
 labors
 though
 doubtless
 since
 his
 recognition
 of
 the
 Greater
 One
 for
 whose
 coming
 he
 had
 been
 sent
 to
 prepare
 he
 considered
 the
 baptism
 he
 administered
 as
 of
 somewhat
 different
 significance
 He
 had
 at
 first
 baptized
 in
 preparation
 for
 One
 who
 was
 to
 come
 now
 he
 baptized
 repentant
 believers
 unto
 Him
 who
 had
 come
 Disputation
 had
 arisen
 between
 some
 of
 Johns
 zealous
 adherents
 and
 one
 or
 more
 Jews
 concerning
 the
 doctrine
 of
 purifying
 The
 context
 leaves
 little
 room
 for
 doubt
 that
 a
 question
 was
 involved
 as
 to
 the
 relative
 merits
 of
 Johns
 baptism
 and
 that
 administered
 by
 the
 disciples
 of
 Jesus
 With
 excusable
 ardor
 and
 wellintended
 zeal
 for
 their
 master
 the
 disciples
 of
 John
 who
 had
 been
 embroiled
 in
 the
 dispute
 came
 to
 him
 saying
 Rabbi
 he
 that
 was
 with
 thee
 beyond
 Jordan
 to
 whom
 thou
 bearest
 witness
 behold
 the
 same
 baptizeth
 and
 all
 men
 come
 to
 him
 Johns
 supporters
 were
 concerned
 at
 the
 success
 of
 One
 whom
 they
 regarded
 in
 some
 measure
 as
 a
 rival
 to
 their
 beloved
 teacher
 Had
 not
 John
 given
 to
 Jesus
 His
 first
 attestation
 He
 to
 whom
 thou
 bearest
 witness
 said
 they
 not
 deigning
 even
 to
 designate
 Jesus
 by
 name
 Following
 the
 example
 of
 Andrew
 and
 of
 John
 the
 future
 apostle
 the
 people
 were
 leaving
 the
 Baptist
 and
 gathering
 about
 the
 Christ
 Johns
 reply
 to
 his
 ardent
 followers
 constitutes
 a
 sublime
 instance
 of
 selfabnegation
 His
 answer
 was
 to
 this
 effect
 A
 man
 receives
 only
 as
 God
 gives
 unto
 him
 It
 is
 not
 given
 to
 me
 to
 do
 the
 work
 of
 Christ
 Ye
 yourselves
 are
 witnesses
 that
 I
 disclaimed
 being
 the
 Christ
 and
 that
 I
 said
 I
 was
 one
 sent
 before
 Him
 He
 is
 as
 the
 Bridegroom
 I
 am
 only
 as
 the
 friend
 of
 the
 bridegroom
 His
 servant
 and
 I
 rejoice
 greatly
 in
 being
 thus
 near
 Him
 His
 voice
 gives
 me
 happiness
 and
 thus
 my
 joy
 is
 fulfilled
 He
 of
 whom
 you
 speak
 stands
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 His
 ministry
 I
 near
 the
 end
 of
 mine
 He
 must
 increase
 but
 I
 must
 decrease
 He
 came
 from
 heaven
 and
 therefore
 is
 superior
 to
 all
 things
 of
 earth
 nevertheless
 men
 refuse
 to
 receive
 His
 testimony
 To
 such
 a
 One
 the
 Spirit
 of
 God
 is
 not
 apportioned
 it
 is
 His
 in
 full
 measure
 The
 Father
 loveth
 Him
 the
 Son
 and
 hath
 given
 all
 things
 into
 His
 hand
 and
 He
 that
 believeth
 on
 the
 Son
 hath
 everlasting
 life
 and
 he
 that
 believeth
 not
 the
 Son
 shall
 not
 see
 life
 but
 the
 wrath
 of
 God
 abideth
 on
 him
 In
 such
 a
 reply
 under
 the
 existent
 conditions
 is
 to
 be
 found
 the
 spirit
 of
 true
 greatness
 and
 of
 a
 humility
 that
 could
 rest
 only
 on
 a
 conviction
 of
 divine
 assurance
 to
 the
 Baptist
 as
 to
 himself
 and
 the
 Christ
 In
 more
 than
 one
 sense
 was
 John
 great
 among
 all
 who
 are
 born
 of
 women
 He
 had
 entered
 upon
 his
 work
 when
 sent
 of
 God
 so
 to
 do
 he
 realized
 that
 his
 work
 had
 been
 in
 a
 measure
 superseded
 and
 he
 patiently
 awaited
 his
 release
 in
 the
 meantime
 continuing
 in
 the
 ministry
 directing
 souls
 to
 his
 Master
 The
 beginning
 of
 the
 end
 was
 near
 He
 was
 soon
 seized
 and
 thrown
 into
 a
 dungeon
 where
 as
 shall
 be
 shown
 he
 was
 beheaded
 to
 sate
 the
 vengeance
 of
 a
 corrupt
 woman
 whose
 sins
 he
 had
 boldly
 denounced
 The
 Pharisees
 observed
 with
 increasing
 apprehension
 the
 growing
 popularity
 of
 Jesus
 evidenced
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 even
 more
 followed
 after
 Him
 and
 accepted
 baptism
 at
 the
 hands
 of
 His
 disciples
 than
 had
 responded
 to
 the
 Baptists
 call
 Open
 opposition
 was
 threatened
 and
 as
 Jesus
 desired
 to
 avert
 the
 hindrance
 to
 His
 work
 which
 such
 persecution
 at
 that
 time
 would
 entail
 He
 withdrew
 from
 Judea
 and
 retired
 to
 Galilee
 journeying
 by
 way
 of
 Samaria
 This
 return
 to
 the
 northern
 province
 was
 effected
 after
 the
 Baptist
 had
 been
 cast
 into
 prison
 NOTES
 TO
 CHAPTER
 
 
 Sea
 of
 GalileeThis
 the
 largest
 body
 of
 fresh
 water
 in
 Palestine
 is
 somewhat
 pearshape
 in
 outline
 and
 measures
 approximately
 thirteen
 miles
 in
 extreme
 length
 on
 a
 northerlysoutherly
 line
 and
 between
 six
 and
 seven
 miles
 in
 greatest
 width
 The
 river
 Jordan
 enters
 it
 at
 the
 northeast
 extremity
 and
 flows
 out
 at
 the
 southwest
 the
 lake
 may
 be
 regarded
 therefore
 as
 a
 great
 expansion
 of
 the
 river
 though
 the
 waterfilled
 depression
 is
 about
 two
 hundred
 feet
 in
 depth
 The
 outflowing
 Jordan
 connects
 the
 sea
 of
 Galilee
 with
 the
 Dead
 Sea
 the
 latter
 a
 body
 of
 intensely
 saline
 water
 which
 in
 its
 abundance
 of
 dissolved
 salts
 and
 in
 the
 consequent
 density
 of
 its
 brine
 is
 comparable
 to
 the
 Great
 Salt
 Lake
 in
 Utah
 though
 the
 chemical
 composition
 of
 the
 waters
 is
 materially
 different
 The
 sea
 of
 Galilee
 is
 referred
 to
 by
 Luke
 in
 accordance
 with
 its
 more
 appropriate
 classification
 as
 a
 lake
 Luke
 
 
 
 
 
 Adjoining
 the
 lake
 on
 the
 northwest
 is
 a
 plain
 which
 in
 earlier
 times
 was
 highly
 cultivated
 this
 was
 known
 as
 the
 land
 of
 Gennesaret
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 and
 the
 water
 body
 came
 to
 be
 known
 as
 the
 sea
 or
 lake
 of
 Gennesaret
 Luke
 
 From
 the
 prominence
 of
 one
 of
 the
 cities
 on
 its
 western
 shore
 it
 was
 known
 also
 as
 the
 sea
 of
 Tiberias
 John
 
 
 In
 the
 Old
 Testament
 it
 is
 called
 the
 sea
 of
 Chinnereth
 Numb
 
 or
 Chinneroth
 Josh
 
 after
 the
 name
 of
 a
 contiguous
 city
 Josh
 
 The
 surface
 of
 the
 lake
 or
 sea
 is
 several
 hundred
 feet
 below
 normal
 sealevel
 
 feet
 lower
 than
 the
 Mediterranean
 according
 to
 Zenos
 or
 
 feet
 as
 stated
 by
 some
 others
 This
 lowlying
 position
 gives
 to
 the
 region
 a
 semitropical
 climate
 Zenos
 in
 the
 Standard
 Bible
 Dictionary
 says
 The
 waters
 of
 the
 lake
 are
 noted
 for
 abundant
 fish
 The
 industry
 of
 fishing
 was
 accordingly
 one
 of
 the
 most
 stable
 resources
 of
 the
 country
 round
 about
 Another
 feature
 of
 the
 sea
 of
 Galilee
 is
 its
 susceptibility
 to
 sudden
 storms
 These
 are
 occasioned
 partly
 by
 its
 lying
 so
 much
 lower
 than
 the
 surrounding
 tableland
 a
 fact
 that
 creates
 a
 difference
 of
 temperature
 and
 consequent
 disturbances
 in
 the
 atmosphere
 and
 partly
 by
 the
 rushing
 of
 gusts
 of
 wind
 down
 the
 Jordan
 valley
 from
 the
 heights
 of
 Hermon
 The
 event
 recorded
 in
 Matt
 
 is
 no
 extraordinary
 case
 Those
 who
 ply
 boats
 on
 the
 lake
 are
 obliged
 to
 exercize
 great
 care
 to
 avoid
 peril
 from
 such
 storms
 The
 shores
 of
 the
 sea
 of
 Galilee
 as
 well
 as
 the
 lake
 itself
 were
 the
 scenes
 of
 many
 of
 the
 most
 remarkable
 events
 recorded
 in
 the
 Gospels
 
 The
 Four
 GospelsAll
 careful
 students
 of
 the
 New
 Testament
 must
 have
 observed
 that
 the
 books
 of
 Matthew
 Mark
 and
 Luke
 treat
 the
 events
 of
 the
 Saviors
 sayings
 and
 doings
 in
 Galilee
 with
 greater
 fulness
 than
 they
 accord
 to
 His
 work
 in
 Judea
 the
 book
 or
 Gospel
 of
 John
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 treats
 particularly
 the
 incidents
 of
 our
 Lords
 Judean
 ministry
 without
 excluding
 however
 important
 events
 that
 occurred
 in
 Galilee
 In
 style
 of
 writing
 and
 method
 of
 treatment
 the
 authors
 of
 the
 first
 three
 Gospels
 evangelists
 as
 they
 and
 John
 are
 collectively
 styled
 in
 theologic
 literature
 differ
 more
 markedly
 from
 the
 author
 of
 the
 fourth
 Gospel
 than
 among
 themselves
 The
 events
 recorded
 by
 the
 first
 three
 can
 be
 more
 readily
 classified
 collated
 or
 arranged
 and
 in
 consequence
 the
 Gospels
 written
 by
 Matthew
 Mark
 and
 Luke
 are
 now
 commonly
 known
 as
 the
 Synoptics
 or
 Synoptic
 Gospels
 
 Thirty
 Years
 of
 AgeAccording
 to
 Luke
 
 Jesus
 was
 about
 thirty
 years
 of
 age
 at
 the
 time
 of
 His
 baptism
 and
 we
 find
 that
 soon
 thereafter
 He
 entered
 publicly
 upon
 the
 work
 of
 His
 ministry
 The
 law
 provided
 that
 at
 the
 age
 of
 thirty
 years
 the
 Levites
 were
 required
 to
 enter
 upon
 their
 special
 service
 Numb
 
 Clarke
 Bible
 Commentary
 treating
 the
 passage
 in
 Luke
 
 says
 This
 was
 the
 age
 required
 by
 the
 law
 to
 which
 the
 priests
 must
 arrive
 before
 they
 could
 be
 installed
 in
 their
 office
 Jesus
 may
 possibly
 have
 had
 regard
 for
 what
 had
 become
 a
 custom
 of
 the
 time
 in
 waiting
 until
 He
 had
 attained
 that
 age
 before
 entering
 publicly
 on
 the
 labors
 of
 a
 Teacher
 among
 the
 people
 Not
 being
 of
 Levitical
 descent
 He
 was
 not
 eligible
 to
 priestly
 ordination
 in
 the
 Aaronic
 order
 and
 therefore
 certainly
 did
 not
 wait
 for
 such
 before
 beginning
 His
 ministry
 To
 have
 taught
 in
 public
 at
 an
 earlier
 age
 would
 have
 been
 to
 arouse
 criticism
 and
 objection
 which
 might
 have
 resulted
 in
 serious
 handicap
 or
 hindrance
 at
 the
 outset
 
 Throngs
 and
 Confusion
 at
 the
 Passover
 FestivalWhile
 it
 is
 admittedly
 impossible
 that
 even
 a
 reasonably
 large
 fraction
 of
 the
 Jewish
 people
 could
 be
 present
 at
 the
 annual
 Passover
 gatherings
 at
 Jerusalem
 and
 in
 consequence
 provision
 was
 made
 for
 local
 observance
 of
 the
 feast
 the
 usual
 attendance
 at
 the
 temple
 celebration
 in
 the
 days
 of
 Jesus
 was
 undoubtedly
 enormous
 Josephus
 calls
 the
 Passover
 throngs
 an
 innumerable
 multitude
 Wars
 ii
 
 and
 in
 another
 place
 Wars
 vi
 
 states
 that
 the
 attendance
 reached
 the
 enormous
 aggregate
 of
 three
 millions
 of
 souls
 such
 is
 the
 record
 though
 many
 modern
 writers
 treat
 the
 statement
 as
 an
 exaggeration
 Josephus
 says
 that
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 giving
 the
 emperor
 Nero
 information
 as
 to
 the
 numerical
 strength
 of
 the
 Jewish
 people
 particularly
 in
 Palestine
 the
 chief
 priests
 were
 asked
 by
 Cestius
 to
 count
 the
 number
 of
 lambs
 slain
 at
 the
 feast
 and
 the
 number
 reported
 was
 
 which
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 between
 ten
 and
 eleven
 persons
 to
 each
 paschal
 table
 would
 indicate
 the
 presence
 he
 says
 of
 at
 least
 
 not
 including
 visitors
 other
 than
 Jews
 and
 such
 of
 the
 people
 of
 Israel
 as
 were
 debarred
 from
 participation
 in
 the
 paschal
 meal
 because
 of
 ceremonial
 unfitness
 The
 scenes
 of
 confusion
 inevitable
 under
 the
 conditions
 then
 prevailing
 are
 admirably
 summarized
 by
 Geikie
 Life
 and
 Words
 of
 Christ
 chap
 
 who
 cites
 many
 earlier
 authorities
 for
 his
 statements
 The
 streets
 were
 blocked
 by
 the
 crowds
 from
 all
 parts
 who
 had
 to
 make
 their
 way
 to
 the
 Temple
 past
 flocks
 of
 sheep
 and
 droves
 of
 cattle
 pressing
 on
 in
 the
 sunken
 middle
 part
 of
 each
 street
 reserved
 for
 them
 to
 prevent
 contact
 and
 defilement
 Sellers
 of
 all
 possible
 wares
 beset
 the
 pilgrims
 for
 the
 great
 feasts
 were
 as
 has
 been
 said
 the
 harvest
 time
 of
 all
 trades
 at
 Jerusalem
 just
 as
 at
 Mecca
 even
 at
 this
 day
 the
 time
 of
 the
 great
 concourse
 of
 worshippers
 at
 the
 tomb
 of
 the
 Prophet
 is
 that
 of
 the
 busiest
 trade
 among
 the
 merchant
 pilgrims
 who
 form
 the
 caravans
 from
 all
 parts
 of
 the
 Mohammedan
 world
 Inside
 the
 Temple
 space
 the
 noise
 and
 pressure
 were
 if
 possible
 worse
 Directions
 were
 posted
 up
 to
 keep
 to
 the
 right
 or
 the
 left
 as
 in
 the
 densest
 thoroughfares
 of
 London
 The
 outer
 court
 which
 others
 than
 Jews
 might
 enter
 and
 which
 was
 therefore
 known
 as
 the
 Court
 of
 the
 Heathen
 was
 in
 part
 covered
 with
 pens
 for
 sheep
 goats
 and
 cattle
 for
 the
 feast
 and
 the
 thankofferings
 Sellers
 shouted
 the
 merits
 of
 their
 beasts
 sheep
 bleated
 and
 oxen
 lowed
 It
 was
 in
 fact
 the
 great
 yearly
 fair
 of
 Jerusalem
 and
 the
 crowds
 added
 to
 the
 din
 and
 tumult
 till
 the
 services
 in
 the
 neighboring
 courts
 were
 sadly
 disturbed
 Sellers
 of
 doves
 for
 poor
 women
 coming
 for
 purification
 from
 all
 parts
 of
 the
 country
 and
 for
 others
 had
 a
 space
 set
 apart
 for
 them
 Indeed
 the
 sale
 of
 doves
 was
 in
 great
 measure
 secretly
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 the
 priests
 themselves
 Hannas
 the
 high
 priest
 especially
 gaining
 great
 profits
 from
 his
 dove
 cotes
 on
 Mount
 Olivet
 The
 rents
 of
 the
 sheep
 and
 cattle
 pens
 and
 the
 profits
 on
 the
 doves
 had
 led
 the
 priests
 to
 sanction
 the
 incongruity
 of
 thus
 turning
 the
 Temple
 itself
 into
 a
 noisy
 market
 Nor
 was
 this
 all
 Potters
 pressed
 on
 the
 pilgrims
 their
 clay
 dishes
 and
 ovens
 for
 the
 Passover
 lamb
 hundreds
 of
 traders
 recommended
 their
 wares
 aloud
 shops
 for
 wine
 oil
 salt
 and
 all
 else
 needed
 for
 sacrifices
 invited
 customers
 and
 in
 addition
 persons
 going
 across
 the
 city
 with
 all
 kinds
 of
 burdens
 shortened
 their
 journey
 by
 crossing
 the
 Temple
 grounds
 The
 provision
 for
 paying
 the
 tribute
 levied
 on
 all
 for
 the
 support
 of
 the
 Temple
 added
 to
 the
 distraction
 On
 both
 sides
 of
 the
 east
 Temple
 gate
 stalls
 had
 for
 generations
 been
 permitted
 for
 changing
 foreign
 money
 From
 the
 fifteenth
 of
 the
 preceding
 month
 moneychangers
 had
 been
 allowed
 to
 set
 up
 their
 tables
 in
 the
 city
 and
 from
 the
 twentyfirstor
 twenty
 days
 before
 the
 Passoverto
 ply
 their
 trade
 in
 the
 Temple
 itself
 Purchasers
 of
 materials
 for
 offerings
 paid
 the
 amount
 at
 special
 stalls
 to
 an
 officer
 of
 the
 Temple
 and
 received
 a
 leaden
 cheque
 for
 which
 they
 got
 what
 they
 had
 bought
 from
 the
 seller
 Large
 sums
 moreover
 were
 changed
 to
 be
 cast
 as
 free
 offerings
 into
 one
 of
 the
 thirteen
 chests
 which
 formed
 the
 Temple
 treasury
 Every
 Jew
 no
 matter
 how
 poor
 was
 in
 addition
 required
 to
 pay
 yearly
 a
 halfshekelabout
 eighteen
 penceas
 atonement
 money
 for
 his
 soul
 and
 for
 the
 support
 of
 the
 Temple
 As
 this
 would
 not
 be
 received
 except
 in
 a
 native
 coin
 called
 the
 Temple
 shekel
 which
 was
 not
 generally
 current
 strangers
 had
 to
 change
 their
 Roman
 Greek
 or
 Eastern
 money
 at
 the
 stalls
 of
 the
 moneychangers
 to
 get
 the
 coin
 required
 The
 trade
 gave
 ready
 means
 for
 fraud
 which
 was
 only
 too
 common
 Five
 per
 cent
 exchange
 was
 charged
 but
 this
 was
 indefinitely
 increased
 by
 tricks
 and
 chicanery
 for
 which
 the
 class
 had
 everywhere
 earned
 so
 bad
 a
 name
 that
 like
 the
 publicans
 their
 witness
 would
 not
 be
 taken
 before
 a
 court
 Touching
 the
 matter
 of
 the
 defilement
 to
 which
 the
 temple
 courts
 had
 been
 subjected
 by
 traffickers
 acting
 under
 priestly
 license
 Farrar
 Life
 of
 Christ
 p
 
 gives
 us
 the
 following
 And
 this
 was
 the
 entrancecourt
 to
 the
 Temple
 of
 the
 Most
 High
 The
 court
 which
 was
 a
 witness
 that
 that
 house
 should
 be
 a
 House
 of
 Prayer
 for
 all
 nations
 had
 been
 degraded
 into
 a
 place
 which
 for
 foulness
 was
 more
 like
 shambles
 and
 for
 bustling
 commerce
 more
 like
 a
 denselycrowded
 bazaar
 while
 the
 lowing
 of
 oxen
 the
 bleating
 of
 sheep
 the
 Babel
 of
 many
 languages
 the
 huckstering
 and
 wrangling
 and
 the
 clinking
 of
 money
 and
 of
 balances
 perhaps
 not
 always
 just
 might
 be
 heard
 in
 the
 adjoining
 courts
 disturbing
 the
 chant
 of
 the
 Levites
 and
 the
 prayers
 of
 priests
 
 The
 Servility
 of
 the
 Jews
 in
 the
 Presence
 of
 JesusThe
 record
 of
 the
 achievement
 of
 Jesus
 in
 ridding
 the
 temple
 courts
 of
 those
 who
 had
 made
 the
 House
 of
 the
 Lord
 a
 market
 place
 contains
 nothing
 to
 suggest
 the
 inference
 that
 He
 exercized
 superhuman
 strength
 or
 more
 than
 manly
 vigor
 He
 employed
 a
 whip
 of
 His
 own
 making
 and
 drove
 all
 before
 Him
 They
 fled
 helterskelter
 None
 are
 said
 to
 have
 voiced
 an
 objection
 until
 the
 expulsion
 had
 been
 made
 complete
 Why
 did
 not
 some
 among
 the
 multitude
 object
 The
 submission
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 abject
 and
 servile
 in
 the
 extreme
 Farrar
 Life
 of
 Christ
 pp
 
 
 raises
 the
 question
 and
 answers
 it
 with
 excellent
 reasoning
 and
 in
 eloquent
 lines
 Why
 did
 not
 this
 multitude
 of
 ignorant
 pilgrims
 resist
 Why
 did
 these
 greedy
 chafferers
 content
 themselves
 with
 dark
 scowls
 and
 muttered
 maledictions
 while
 they
 suffered
 their
 oxen
 and
 sheep
 to
 be
 chased
 into
 the
 streets
 and
 themselves
 ejected
 and
 their
 money
 flung
 rolling
 on
 the
 floor
 by
 one
 who
 was
 then
 young
 and
 unknown
 and
 in
 the
 garb
 of
 despised
 Galilee
 Why
 in
 the
 same
 way
 we
 might
 ask
 did
 Saul
 suffer
 Samuel
 to
 beard
 him
 in
 the
 very
 presence
 of
 his
 army
 Why
 did
 David
 abjectly
 obey
 the
 orders
 of
 Joab
 Why
 did
 Ahab
 not
 dare
 to
 arrest
 Elijah
 at
 the
 door
 of
 Naboths
 vineyard
 Because
 sin
 is
 weakness
 because
 there
 is
 in
 the
 world
 nothing
 so
 abject
 as
 a
 guilty
 conscience
 nothing
 so
 invincible
 as
 the
 sweeping
 tide
 of
 a
 Godlike
 indignation
 against
 all
 that
 is
 base
 and
 wrong
 How
 could
 these
 paltry
 sacrilegious
 buyers
 and
 sellers
 conscious
 of
 wrongdoing
 oppose
 that
 scathing
 rebuke
 or
 face
 the
 lightnings
 of
 those
 eyes
 that
 were
 enkindled
 by
 an
 outraged
 holiness
 When
 Phinehas
 the
 priest
 was
 zealous
 for
 the
 Lord
 of
 Hosts
 and
 drove
 through
 the
 bodies
 of
 the
 prince
 of
 Simeon
 and
 the
 Midianitish
 woman
 with
 one
 glorious
 thrust
 of
 his
 indignant
 spear
 why
 did
 not
 guilty
 Israel
 avenge
 that
 splendid
 murder
 Why
 did
 not
 every
 man
 of
 the
 tribe
 of
 Simeon
 become
 a
 Goel
 to
 the
 dauntless
 assassin
 Because
 Vice
 cannot
 stand
 for
 one
 moment
 before
 Virtues
 uplifted
 arm
 Base
 and
 grovelling
 as
 they
 were
 these
 moneymongering
 Jews
 felt
 in
 all
 that
 remnant
 of
 their
 souls
 which
 was
 not
 yet
 eaten
 away
 by
 infidelity
 and
 avarice
 that
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 was
 right
 Nay
 even
 the
 Priests
 and
 Pharisees
 and
 Scribes
 and
 Levites
 devoured
 as
 they
 were
 by
 pride
 and
 formalism
 could
 not
 condemn
 an
 act
 which
 might
 have
 been
 performed
 by
 a
 Nehemiah
 or
 a
 Judas
 Maccabaeus
 and
 which
 agreed
 with
 all
 that
 was
 purest
 and
 best
 in
 their
 traditions
 But
 when
 they
 had
 heard
 of
 this
 deed
 or
 witnessed
 it
 and
 had
 time
 to
 recover
 from
 the
 breathless
 mixture
 of
 admiration
 disgust
 and
 astonishment
 which
 it
 inspired
 they
 came
 to
 Jesus
 and
 though
 they
 did
 not
 dare
 to
 condemn
 what
 He
 had
 done
 yet
 half
 indignantly
 asked
 Him
 for
 some
 sign
 that
 He
 had
 a
 right
 to
 act
 thus
 
 Jewish
 Regard
 for
 the
 TempleThe
 Jews
 professed
 high
 regard
 for
 the
 temple
 An
 utterance
 of
 the
 Savior
 construed
 by
 the
 darkminded
 as
 an
 aspersion
 upon
 the
 temple
 was
 used
 against
 Him
 as
 one
 of
 the
 chief
 accusations
 on
 which
 His
 death
 was
 demanded
 When
 the
 Jews
 clamored
 for
 a
 sign
 of
 His
 authority
 He
 predicted
 His
 own
 death
 and
 subsequent
 resurrection
 saying
 Destroy
 this
 temple
 and
 in
 three
 days
 I
 will
 raise
 it
 up
 John
 
 see
 also
 Matt
 
 
 Mark
 
 
 They
 blindly
 regarded
 this
 remark
 as
 a
 disrespectful
 allusion
 to
 their
 temple
 a
 structure
 built
 by
 human
 hands
 and
 they
 refused
 to
 forget
 or
 forgive
 That
 this
 veneration
 continued
 after
 the
 crucifixion
 of
 our
 Lord
 is
 evident
 from
 accusations
 brought
 against
 Stephen
 and
 still
 later
 against
 Paul
 In
 their
 murderous
 rage
 the
 people
 accused
 Stephen
 of
 disrespect
 for
 the
 temple
 and
 brought
 false
 witnesses
 who
 uttered
 perjured
 testimony
 saying
 This
 man
 ceaseth
 not
 to
 speak
 blasphemous
 words
 against
 this
 holy
 place
 Acts
 
 And
 Stephen
 was
 numbered
 with
 the
 martyrs
 When
 it
 was
 claimed
 that
 Paul
 had
 brought
 with
 him
 into
 the
 temple
 precincts
 a
 Gentile
 the
 whole
 city
 was
 aroused
 and
 the
 infuriated
 mob
 dragged
 Paul
 from
 the
 place
 and
 sought
 to
 kill
 him

 Some
 of
 the
 Chief
 Rulers
 BelievedNicodemus
 was
 not
 the
 only
 one
 among
 the
 ruling
 classes
 who
 believed
 in
 Jesus
 but
 of
 most
 of
 these
 we
 learn
 nothing
 to
 indicate
 that
 they
 had
 sufficient
 courage
 to
 come
 even
 by
 night
 to
 make
 independent
 and
 personal
 inquiry
 They
 feared
 the
 result
 in
 loss
 of
 popularity
 and
 standing
 We
 read
 in
 John
 
 
 Nevertheless
 among
 the
 chief
 rulers
 also
 many
 believed
 on
 him
 but
 because
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 they
 did
 not
 confess
 him
 lest
 they
 should
 be
 put
 out
 of
 the
 synagogue
 for
 they
 loved
 the
 praise
 of
 men
 more
 than
 the
 praise
 of
 God
 Note
 also
 the
 instance
 of
 the
 scribe
 who
 proffered
 to
 become
 a
 professed
 disciple
 but
 probably
 because
 of
 some
 degree
 of
 insincerity
 or
 unfitness
 was
 rather
 discouraged
 than
 approved
 by
 Jesus
 Matt
 
 
 
 NicodemusThe
 course
 followed
 by
 this
 man
 evidences
 at
 once
 that
 he
 really
 believed
 in
 Jesus
 as
 one
 sent
 of
 God
 and
 that
 his
 belief
 failed
 of
 development
 into
 a
 condition
 of
 true
 faith
 which
 had
 it
 but
 been
 realized
 might
 have
 led
 to
 a
 life
 of
 devoted
 service
 in
 the
 Masters
 cause
 When
 at
 a
 later
 stage
 than
 that
 of
 his
 interview
 with
 Christ
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 Pharisees
 upbraided
 the
 officers
 whom
 they
 had
 sent
 to
 take
 Jesus
 into
 custody
 and
 who
 returned
 to
 report
 their
 failure
 Nicodemus
 one
 of
 the
 council
 ventured
 to
 mildly
 expostulate
 against
 the
 murderous
 determination
 of
 the
 rulers
 by
 stating
 a
 general
 proposition
 in
 interrogative
 form
 Doth
 our
 law
 judge
 any
 man
 before
 it
 hear
 him
 and
 know
 what
 he
 doeth
 He
 was
 answered
 by
 his
 colleagues
 with
 contempt
 and
 appears
 to
 have
 abandoned
 his
 wellintended
 effort
 John
 
 read
 preceding
 verses
 
 We
 next
 hear
 of
 him
 bringing
 a
 costly
 contribution
 of
 myrrh
 and
 aloes
 about
 a
 hundredweight
 to
 be
 used
 in
 the
 burial
 of
 Christs
 then
 crucified
 body
 but
 even
 in
 this
 deed
 of
 liberality
 and
 devotion
 in
 which
 his
 sincerity
 of
 purpose
 cannot
 well
 be
 questioned
 he
 had
 been
 preceded
 by
 Joseph
 of
 Arimathea
 a
 man
 of
 rank
 who
 had
 boldly
 asked
 for
 and
 secured
 the
 body
 for
 reverent
 burial
 John
 
 Nevertheless
 Nicodemus
 did
 more
 than
 did
 most
 of
 his
 believing
 associates
 among
 the
 noble
 and
 great
 ones
 and
 to
 him
 let
 all
 due
 credit
 be
 given
 he
 will
 not
 fail
 of
 his
 reward
 
 The
 Jews
 or
 A
 JewWe
 read
 that
 there
 arose
 a
 question
 between
 some
 of
 Johns
 disciples
 and
 the
 Jews
 about
 purifying
 John
 
 Bearing
 in
 mind
 that
 the
 expression
 the
 Jews
 is
 very
 commonly
 used
 by
 the
 author
 of
 the
 fourth
 Gospel
 to
 designate
 the
 officials
 or
 rulers
 among
 the
 people
 the
 passage
 quoted
 may
 be
 understood
 to
 mean
 that
 the
 Baptists
 disciples
 were
 engaged
 in
 disputation
 with
 the
 priestly
 rulers
 It
 is
 held
 however
 by
 Biblical
 scholars
 generally
 that
 the
 Jews
 in
 this
 passage
 is
 a
 mistranslation
 and
 that
 the
 true
 rendering
 is
 a
 Jew
 The
 disputation
 concerning
 purifying
 appears
 to
 have
 arisen
 between
 some
 of
 the
 Baptists
 followers
 and
 a
 single
 opponent
 and
 the
 passage
 as
 it
 appears
 in
 the
 King
 James
 version
 of
 the
 Bible
 is
 an
 instance
 of
 scripture
 not
 translated
 correctly
 
 Friend
 of
 the
 BridegroomJudean
 marriage
 customs
 in
 the
 days
 of
 Christ
 required
 the
 appointing
 of
 a
 chief
 groomsman
 who
 attended
 to
 all
 the
 preliminaries
 and
 made
 arrangements
 for
 the
 marriage
 feast
 in
 behalf
 of
 the
 bridegroom
 He
 was
 distinctively
 known
 as
 the
 friend
 of
 the
 bridegroom
 When
 the
 ceremonial
 requirements
 had
 been
 complied
 with
 and
 the
 bride
 had
 been
 legally
 and
 formally
 given
 unto
 her
 spouse
 the
 joy
 of
 the
 bridegrooms
 friend
 was
 fulfilled
 inasmuch
 as
 his
 appointed
 duties
 had
 been
 successfully
 discharged
 John
 
 According
 to
 Edersheim
 Life
 and
 Times
 of
 Jesus
 the
 Messiah
 vol
 
 p
 
 by
 the
 simpler
 customs
 prevalent
 in
 Galilee
 a
 friend
 of
 the
 bridegroom
 was
 not
 often
 chosen

 of
 which
 citations
 the
 expression

 used

 Jesus

 applied
 collectively
 to
 all
 the
 invited
 guests
 at
 a
 wedding
 festival
 He
 says
 As
 the
 institution
 of
 friends
 of
 the
 bridegroom
 prevailed
 in
 Judea
 but
 not
 in
 Galilee
 this
 marked
 distinction
 of
 the
 friend
 of
 the
 bridegroom
 in
 the
 mouth
 of
 the
 Judean
 John
 and
 sons
 children
 of
 the
 bridechamber
 in
 that
 of
 the
 Galilean
 Jesus
 is
 itself
 evidential
 of
 historic
 accuracy
 
 The
 Atonement
 MoneyIn
 the
 course
 of
 the
 exodus
 the
 Lord
 required
 of
 every
 male
 in
 Israel
 who
 was
 twenty
 years
 old
 or
 older
 at
 the
 time
 of
 a
 census
 the
 payment
 of
 a
 ransom
 amounting
 to
 half
 a
 shekel
 Exo
 
 See
 pages
 
 and
 
 herein
 As
 to
 the
 use
 to
 which
 this
 money
 was
 to
 be
 put
 the
 Lord
 thus
 directed
 Moses
 And
 thou
 shalt
 take
 the
 atonement
 money
 of
 the
 children
 of
 Israel
 and
 shalt
 appoint
 it
 for
 the
 service
 of
 the
 tabernacle
 of
 the
 congregation
 that
 it
 may
 be
 a
 memorial
 unto
 the
 children
 of
 Israel
 before
 the
 Lord
 to
 make
 an
 atonement
 for
 your
 souls
 Exo
 
 see
 also
 
 In
 time
 the
 tax
 of
 half
 a
 shekel
 equivalent
 to
 a
 bekah
 Exo
 
 was
 collected
 annually
 though
 for
 this
 exaction
 no
 scriptural
 authority
 is
 of
 record
 This
 tax
 must
 not
 be
 confused
 with
 the
 redemption
 money
 amounting
 to
 five
 shekels
 for
 every
 firstborn
 male
 the
 payment
 of
 which
 exempted
 the
 individual
 from
 service
 in
 the
 labors
 of
 the
 sanctuary
 In
 place
 of
 the
 firstborn
 sons
 in
 all
 the
 tribes
 the
 Lord
 designated
 the
 Levites
 for
 this
 special
 ministry
 nevertheless
 He
 continued
 to
 hold
 the
 firstborn
 males
 as
 peculiarly
 His
 own
 and
 required
 the
 payment
 of
 a
 ransom
 as
 a
 mark
 of
 their
 redemption
 from
 the
 duties
 of
 exclusive
 service

 CHAPTER
 
 HONORED
 BY
 STRANGERS
 REJECTED
 BY
 HIS
 OWN
 JESUS
 AND
 THE
 SAMARITAN
 WOMAN
 The
 direct
 route
 from
 Judea
 to
 Galilee
 lay
 through
 Samaria
 but
 many
 Jews
 particularly
 Galileans
 chose
 to
 follow
 an
 indirect
 though
 longer
 way
 rather
 than
 traverse
 the
 country
 of
 a
 people
 so
 despized
 by
 them
 as
 were
 the
 Samaritans
 The
 illfeeling
 between
 Jews
 and
 Samaritans
 had
 been
 growing
 for
 centuries
 and
 at
 the
 time
 of
 our
 Lords
 earthly
 ministry
 had
 developed
 into
 most
 intense
 hatred
 The
 inhabitants
 of
 Samaria
 were
 a
 mixed
 people
 in
 whom
 the
 blood
 of
 Israel
 was
 mingled
 with
 that
 of
 the
 Assyrians
 and
 other
 nations
 and
 one
 cause
 of
 the
 animosity
 existing
 between
 them
 and
 their
 neighbors
 both
 on
 the
 north
 and
 the
 south
 was
 the
 Samaritans
 claim
 for
 recognition
 as
 Israelites
 it
 was
 their
 boast
 that
 Jacob
 was
 their
 father
 but
 this
 the
 Jews
 denied
 The
 Samaritans
 had
 a
 version
 of
 the
 Pentateuch
 which
 they
 revered
 as
 the
 law
 but
 they
 rejected
 all
 the
 prophetical
 writings
 of
 what
 is
 now
 the
 Old
 Testament
 because
 they
 considered
 themselves
 treated
 with
 insufficient
 respect
 therein
 To
 the
 orthodox
 Jew
 of
 the
 time
 a
 Samaritan
 was
 more
 unclean
 than
 a
 Gentile
 of
 any
 other
 nationality
 It
 is
 interesting
 to
 note
 the
 extreme
 and
 even
 absurd
 restrictions
 then
 in
 force
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 regulating
 unavoidable
 relations
 between
 the
 two
 peoples
 The
 testimony
 of
 a
 Samaritan
 could
 not
 be
 heard
 before
 a
 Jewish
 tribunal
 For
 a
 Jew
 to
 eat
 food
 prepared
 by
 a
 Samaritan
 was
 at
 one
 time
 regarded
 by
 rabbinical
 authority
 as
 an
 offense
 as
 great
 as
 that
 of
 eating
 the
 flesh
 of
 swine
 While
 it
 was
 admitted
 that
 produce
 from
 a
 field
 in
 Samaria
 was
 not
 unclean
 inasmuch
 as
 it
 sprang
 directly
 from
 the
 soil
 such
 produce
 became
 unclean
 if
 subjected
 to
 any
 treatment
 at
 Samaritan
 hands
 Thus
 grapes
 and
 grain
 might
 be
 purchased
 from
 Samaritans
 but
 neither
 wine
 nor
 flour
 manufactured
 therefrom
 by
 Samaritan
 labor
 On
 one
 occasion
 the
 epithet
 Samaritan
 was
 hurled
 at
 Christ
 as
 an
 intended
 insult
 Say
 we
 not
 well
 that
 thou
 art
 a
 Samaritan
 and
 hast
 a
 devil
 The
 Samaritan
 conception
 of
 the
 mission
 of
 the
 expected
 Messiah
 was
 somewhat
 better
 founded
 than
 was
 that
 of
 the
 Jews
 for
 the
 Samaritans
 gave
 greater
 prominence
 to
 the
 spiritual
 kingdom
 the
 Messiah
 would
 establish
 and
 were
 less
 exclusive
 in
 their
 views
 as
 to
 whom
 the
 Messianic
 blessings
 would
 be
 extended
 In
 His
 journey
 to
 Galilee
 Jesus
 took
 the
 shorter
 course
 through
 Samaria
 and
 doubtless
 His
 choice
 was
 guided
 by
 purpose
 for
 we
 read
 that
 He
 must
 needs
 go
 that
 way
 The
 road
 led
 through
 or
 by
 the
 town
 called
 Sychar
 near
 to
 the
 parcel
 of
 ground
 that
 Jacob
 gave
 to
 his
 son
 Joseph
 There
 was
 Jacobs
 well
 which
 was
 held
 in
 high
 esteem
 not
 only
 for
 its
 intrinsic
 worth
 as
 an
 unfailing
 source
 of
 water
 but
 also
 because
 of
 its
 association
 with
 the
 great
 patriarchs
 life
 Jesus
 travelwarn
 and
 weary
 rested
 at
 the
 well
 while
 His
 disciples
 went
 to
 the
 town
 to
 buy
 food
 A
 woman
 came
 to
 fill
 her
 waterjar
 and
 Jesus
 said
 to
 her
 Give
 me
 to
 drink
 By
 the
 rules
 of
 oriental
 hospitality
 then
 prevailing
 a
 request
 for
 water
 was
 one
 that
 should
 never
 be
 denied
 if
 possible
 to
 grant
 yet
 the
 woman
 hesitated
 for
 she
 was
 amazed
 that
 a
 Jew
 should
 ask
 a
 favor
 of
 a
 Samaritan
 however
 great
 the
 need
 She
 expressed
 her
 surprize
 in
 the
 question
 How
 is
 it
 that
 thou
 being
 a
 Jew
 askest
 drink
 of
 me
 which
 am
 a
 woman
 of
 Samaria
 for
 the
 Jews
 have
 no
 dealings
 with
 the
 Samaritans
 Jesus
 seemingly
 forgetful
 of
 thirst
 in
 His
 desire
 to
 teach
 answered
 her
 by
 saving
 If
 thou
 knewest
 the
 gift
 of
 God
 and
 who
 it
 is
 that
 saith
 to
 thee
 Give
 me
 to
 drink
 thou
 wouldest
 have
 asked
 of
 him
 and
 he
 would
 have
 given
 thee
 living
 water
 The
 woman
 reminded
 Him
 that
 He
 had
 no
 bucket
 or
 cord
 with
 which
 to
 draw
 from
 the
 deep
 well
 and
 inquired
 further
 as
 to
 His
 meaning
 adding
 Art
 thou
 greater
 than
 our
 father
 Jacob
 which
 gave
 us
 the
 well
 and
 drank
 thereof
 himself
 and
 his
 children
 and
 his
 cattle
 Jesus
 found
 in
 the
 womans
 words
 a
 spirit
 similar
 to
 that
 with
 which
 the
 scholarly
 Nicodemus
 had
 received
 His
 teachings
 each
 failed
 alike
 to
 perceive
 the
 spiritual
 lesson
 He
 would
 impart
 He
 explained
 to
 her
 that
 water
 from
 the
 well
 would
 be
 of
 but
 temporary
 benefit
 to
 one
 who
 drank
 of
 it
 thirst
 would
 return
 But
 he
 added
 whosoever
 drinketh
 of
 the
 water
 that
 I
 shall
 give
 him
 shall
 never
 thirst
 but
 the
 water
 that
 I
 shall
 give
 him
 shall
 be
 in
 him
 a
 well
 of
 water
 springing
 up
 into
 everlasting
 life
 The
 womans
 interest
 was
 keenly
 aroused
 either
 from
 curiosity
 or
 as
 an
 emotion
 of
 deeper
 concern
 for
 she
 now
 became
 the
 petitioner
 and
 addressing
 Him
 by
 a
 title
 of
 respect
 said
 Sir
 give
 me
 this
 water
 that
 I
 thirst
 not
 neither
 come
 hither
 to
 draw
 She
 could
 see
 nothing
 beyond
 the
 material
 advantage
 attaching
 to
 water
 that
 would
 once
 and
 for
 all
 quench
 thirst
 The
 result
 of
 the
 draught
 she
 had
 in
 mind
 would
 be
 to
 give
 her
 immunity
 from
 one
 bodily
 need
 and
 save
 her
 the
 labor
 of
 coming
 to
 draw
 from
 the
 well
 The
 subject
 of
 the
 conversation
 was
 abruptly
 changed
 by
 Jesus
 bidding
 her
 to
 go
 call
 her
 husband
 and
 return
 To
 her
 reply
 that
 she
 had
 no
 husband
 Jesus
 revealed
 to
 her
 His
 superhuman
 powers
 of
 discernment
 by
 telling
 her
 she
 had
 spoken
 truthfully
 inasmuch
 as
 she
 had
 had
 five
 husbands
 while
 the
 man
 with
 whom
 she
 was
 then
 living
 was
 not
 her
 husband
 Surely
 no
 ordinary
 being
 could
 have
 so
 read
 the
 unpleasing
 story
 of
 her
 life
 she
 impulsively
 confessed
 her
 conviction
 saying
 Sir
 I
 perceive
 that
 thou
 art
 a
 prophet
 She
 desired
 to
 turn
 the
 conversation
 and
 pointing
 to
 Mount
 Gerizim
 upon
 which
 the
 sacrilegious
 priest
 Manasseh
 had
 erected
 a
 Samaritan
 temple
 she
 remarked
 with
 little
 pertinence
 to
 what
 had
 been
 said
 before
 Our
 fathers
 worshipped
 in
 this
 mountain
 and
 ye
 say
 that
 in
 Jerusalem
 is
 the
 place
 where
 men
 ought
 to
 worship
 Jesus
 replied
 in
 yet
 deeper
 vein
 telling
 her
 that
 the
 time
 was
 near
 when
 neither
 that
 mountain
 nor
 Jerusalem
 would
 be
 preeminently
 a
 place
 of
 worship
 and
 He
 clearly
 rebuked
 her
 presumption
 that
 the
 traditional
 belief
 of
 the
 Samaritans
 was
 equally
 good
 with
 that
 of
 the
 Jews
 for
 said
 He
 Ye
 worship
 ye
 know
 not
 what
 we
 know
 what
 we
 worship
 for
 salvation
 is
 of
 the
 Jews
 Changed
 and
 corrupted
 as
 the
 Jewish
 religion
 had
 become
 it
 was
 better
 than
 that
 of
 her
 people
 for
 the
 Jews
 did
 accept
 the
 prophets
 and
 through
 Judah
 the
 Messiah
 had
 come
 But
 as
 Jesus
 expounded
 the
 matter
 to
 her
 the
 place
 of
 worship
 was
 of
 lesser
 importance
 than
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 worshiper
 God
 is
 a
 Spirit
 and
 they
 that
 worship
 him
 must
 worship
 him
 in
 spirit
 and
 in
 truth
 Unable
 or
 unwilling
 to
 understand
 Christs
 meaning
 the
 woman
 sought
 to
 terminate
 the
 lesson
 by
 a
 remark
 that
 probably
 was
 to
 her
 but
 casual
 I
 know
 that
 Messias
 cometh
 which
 is
 called
 Christ
 when
 he
 is
 come
 he
 will
 tell
 us
 all
 things
 Then
 to
 her
 profound
 amazement
 Jesus
 rejoined
 with
 the
 aweinspiring
 declaration
 I
 that
 speak
 unto
 thee
 am
 he
 The
 language
 was
 unequivocal
 the
 assertion
 one
 that
 required
 no
 elucidation
 The
 woman
 must
 regard
 Him
 thereafter
 as
 either
 an
 imposter
 or
 the
 Messiah
 She
 left
 her
 pitcher
 at
 the
 well
 and
 hastening
 to
 the
 town
 told
 of
 her
 experience
 saying
 Come
 see
 a
 man
 which
 told
 me
 all
 things
 that
 ever
 I
 did
 is
 not
 this
 the
 Christ
 Near
 the
 conclusion
 of
 the
 interview
 between
 Jesus
 and
 the
 woman
 the
 returning
 disciples
 arrived
 with
 the
 provisions
 they
 had
 gone
 to
 procure
 They
 marveled
 at
 finding
 the
 Master
 in
 conversation
 with
 a
 woman
 and
 a
 Samaritan
 woman
 at
 that
 yet
 none
 of
 them
 asked
 of
 Him
 an
 explanation
 His
 manner
 must
 have
 impressed
 them
 with
 the
 seriousness
 and
 solemnity
 of
 the
 occasion
 When
 they
 urged
 Him
 to
 eat
 He
 said
 I
 have
 meat
 to
 eat
 that
 ye
 know
 not
 of
 To
 them
 His
 words
 had
 no
 significance
 beyond
 the
 literal
 sense
 and
 they
 queried
 among
 themselves
 as
 to
 whether
 some
 one
 had
 brought
 Him
 food
 during
 their
 absence
 but
 He
 enlightened
 them
 in
 this
 way
 My
 meat
 is
 to
 do
 the
 will
 of
 him
 that
 sent
 me
 and
 to
 finish
 his
 work
 A
 crowd
 of
 Samaritans
 appeared
 coming
 from
 the
 city
 Looking
 upon
 them
 and
 upon
 the
 grain
 fields
 nearby
 Jesus
 continued
 Say
 not
 ye
 There
 are
 yet
 four
 months
 and
 then
 cometh
 harvest
 behold
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Lift
 up
 your
 eyes
 and
 look
 on
 the
 fields
 for
 they
 are
 white
 already
 to
 harvest
 The
 import
 of
 the
 saying
 seems
 to
 be
 that
 while
 months
 would
 elapse
 before
 the
 wheat
 and
 the
 barley
 were
 ready
 for
 the
 sickle
 the
 harvest
 of
 souls
 exemplified
 by
 the
 approaching
 crowd
 was
 even
 then
 ready
 and
 that
 from
 what
 He
 had
 sown
 the
 disciples
 might
 reap
 to
 their
 inestimable
 advantage
 since
 they
 would
 have
 wages
 for
 their
 hire
 and
 would
 gather
 the
 fruits
 of
 other
 labor
 than
 their
 own
 Many
 of
 the
 Samaritans
 believed
 on
 Christ
 at
 first
 on
 the
 strength
 of
 the
 womans
 testimony
 then
 because
 of
 their
 own
 conviction
 and
 they
 said
 to
 the
 woman
 at
 whose
 behest
 they
 had
 at
 first
 gone
 to
 meet
 Him
 Now
 we
 believe
 not
 because
 of
 thy
 saying
 for
 we
 have
 heard
 him
 ourselves
 and
 know
 that
 this
 is
 indeed
 the
 Christ
 the
 Saviour
 of
 the
 world
 Graciously
 He
 acceded
 to
 their
 request
 to
 remain
 and
 tarried
 with
 them
 two
 days
 It
 is
 beyond
 question
 that
 Jesus
 did
 not
 share
 in
 the
 national
 prejudice
 of
 the
 Jews
 against
 the
 people
 of
 Samaria
 an
 honest
 soul
 was
 acceptable
 to
 Him
 come
 whence
 he
 may
 Probably
 the
 seed
 sown
 during
 this
 brief
 stay
 of
 our
 Lord
 among
 the
 despized
 people
 of
 Samaria
 was
 that
 from
 which
 so
 rich
 a
 harvest
 was
 reaped
 by
 the
 apostles
 in
 after
 years
 JESUS
 AGAIN
 IN
 GALILEE
 AT
 CANA
 AND
 NAZARETH
 Following
 the
 two
 days
 sojourn
 among
 the
 Samaritans
 Jesus
 accompanied
 by
 the
 disciples
 who
 had
 traveled
 with
 Him
 from
 Judea
 resumed
 the
 journey
 northward
 into
 Galilee
 from
 which
 province
 He
 had
 been
 absent
 several
 months
 Realizing
 that
 the
 people
 of
 Nazareth
 the
 town
 in
 which
 He
 had
 been
 brought
 up
 would
 be
 probably
 loath
 to
 acknowledge
 Him
 as
 other
 than
 the
 carpenter
 or
 as
 He
 stated
 knowing
 that
 a
 prophet
 hath
 no
 honour
 in
 his
 own
 country
 He
 went
 first
 to
 Cana
 The
 people
 of
 that
 section
 and
 indeed
 the
 Galileans
 generally
 received
 Him
 gladly
 for
 many
 of
 them
 had
 attended
 the
 last
 Passover
 and
 probably
 had
 been
 personal
 witnesses
 of
 the
 wonders
 He
 had
 wrought
 in
 Judea
 While
 at
 Cana
 He
 was
 visited
 by
 a
 nobleman
 most
 likely
 a
 high
 official
 of
 the
 province
 who
 entreated
 Him
 to
 proceed
 to
 Capernaum
 and
 heal
 his
 son
 who
 was
 then
 lying
 at
 the
 point
 of
 death
 With
 the
 probable
 design
 of
 showing
 the
 man
 the
 true
 condition
 of
 his
 mind
 for
 we
 cannot
 doubt
 that
 Jesus
 could
 read
 his
 thoughts
 our
 Lord
 said
 to
 him
 Except
 ye
 see
 signs
 and
 wonders
 ye
 will
 not
 believe
 As
 observed
 in
 earlier
 instances
 notably
 in
 the
 refusal
 of
 Jesus
 to
 commit
 Himself
 to
 the
 professing
 believers
 at
 Jerusalem
 whose
 belief
 rested
 solely
 on
 their
 wonder
 at
 the
 things
 He
 did
 our
 Lord
 would
 not
 regard
 miracles
 though
 wrought
 by
 Himself
 as
 a
 sufficient
 and
 secure
 foundation
 for
 faith
 The
 entreating
 nobleman
 in
 anguish
 over
 the
 precarious
 state
 of
 his
 son
 in
 no
 way
 resented
 the
 rebuke
 such
 as
 a
 captious
 mind
 may
 have
 found
 in
 the
 Lords
 reply
 but
 with
 sincere
 humility
 which
 showed
 his
 belief
 that
 Jesus
 could
 heal
 the
 boy
 he
 renewed
 and
 emphasized
 his
 plea
 Sir
 come
 down
 ere
 my
 child
 die
 Probably
 the
 man
 had
 never
 paused
 to
 reason
 as
 to
 the
 direct
 means
 or
 process
 by
 which
 death
 might
 be
 averted
 and
 healing
 be
 insured
 through
 the
 words
 of
 any
 being
 but
 in
 his
 heart
 he
 believed
 in
 Christs
 power
 and
 with
 pathetic
 earnestness
 besought
 our
 Lord
 to
 intervene
 in
 behalf
 of
 his
 dying
 son
 He
 seemed
 to
 consider
 it
 necessary
 that
 the
 Healer
 be
 present
 and
 his
 great
 fear
 was
 that
 the
 boy
 would
 not
 live
 until
 Jesus
 could
 arrive
 Jesus
 saith
 unto
 him
 Go
 thy
 way
 thy
 son
 liveth
 And
 the
 man
 believed
 the
 word
 that
 Jesus
 had
 spoken
 unto
 him
 and
 he
 went
 his
 way
 The
 genuineness
 of
 the
 mans
 trust
 is
 shown
 by
 his
 grateful
 acceptance
 of
 the
 Lords
 assurance
 and
 by
 the
 contentment
 that
 he
 forthwith
 manifested
 Capernaum
 where
 his
 son
 lay
 was
 about
 twenty
 miles
 away
 had
 he
 been
 still
 solicitous
 and
 doubtful
 he
 would
 probably
 have
 tried
 to
 return
 home
 that
 day
 for
 it
 was
 one
 oclock
 in
 the
 afternoon
 when
 Jesus
 spoke
 the
 words
 that
 had
 given
 to
 him
 such
 relief
 but
 he
 journeyed
 leisurely
 for
 on
 the
 following
 day
 he
 was
 still
 on
 the
 road
 and
 was
 met
 by
 some
 of
 his
 servants
 who
 had
 been
 sent
 to
 cheer
 him
 with
 the
 glad
 word
 of
 his
 sons
 recovery
 He
 inquired
 when
 the
 boy
 had
 begun
 to
 amend
 and
 was
 told
 that
 at
 the
 seventh
 hour
 on
 the
 yesterday
 the
 fever
 had
 left
 him
 That
 was
 the
 time
 at
 which
 Christ
 had
 said
 Thy
 son
 liveth
 The
 mans
 belief
 ripened
 fast
 and
 both
 he
 and
 his
 household
 accepted
 the
 gospel
 This
 was
 the
 second
 miracle
 wrought
 by
 Jesus
 when
 in
 Cana
 though
 in
 this
 instance
 the
 subject
 of
 the
 blessing
 was
 in
 Capernaum
 Our
 Lords
 fame
 spread
 through
 all
 the
 region
 round
 about
 During
 a
 period
 not
 definitely
 stated
 He
 taught
 in
 the
 synagogs
 of
 the
 towns
 and
 was
 received
 with
 favor
 being
 glorified
 of
 all
 He
 then
 returned
 to
 Nazareth
 His
 former
 home
 and
 as
 was
 his
 custom
 attended
 the
 synagog
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 day
 Many
 times
 as
 boy
 and
 man
 He
 had
 sat
 in
 that
 house
 of
 worship
 listening
 to
 the
 reading
 of
 the
 law
 and
 the
 prophets
 and
 to
 the
 commentaries
 or
 Targums
 relating
 thereto
 as
 delivered
 by
 appointed
 readers
 but
 now
 as
 a
 recognized
 teacher
 of
 legal
 age
 He
 was
 eligible
 to
 take
 the
 readers
 place
 On
 this
 occasion
 He
 stood
 up
 to
 read
 when
 the
 service
 had
 reached
 the
 stage
 at
 which
 extracts
 from
 the
 prophetical
 books
 were
 to
 be
 read
 to
 the
 congregation
 The
 minister
 in
 charge
 handed
 Him
 the
 roll
 or
 book
 of
 Isaiah
 He
 turned
 to
 the
 part
 known
 to
 us
 as
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 sixtyfirst
 chapter
 and
 read
 The
 Spirit
 of
 the
 Lord
 is
 upon
 me
 because
 he
 hath
 anointed
 me
 to
 preach
 the
 gospel
 to
 the
 poor
 he
 hath
 sent
 me
 to
 heal
 the
 brokenhearted
 to
 preach
 deliverance
 to
 the
 captives
 and
 recovering
 of
 sight
 to
 the
 blind
 to
 set
 at
 liberty
 them
 that
 are
 bruised
 to
 preach
 the
 acceptable
 year
 of
 the
 Lord
 Handing
 the
 book
 to
 the
 minister
 He
 sat
 down
 It
 was
 allowable
 for
 the
 reader
 in
 the
 service
 of
 the
 Jewish
 synagog
 to
 make
 comments
 in
 explanation
 of
 what
 had
 been
 read
 but
 to
 do
 so
 he
 must
 sit
 When
 Jesus
 took
 His
 seat
 the
 people
 knew
 that
 He
 was
 about
 to
 expound
 the
 text
 and
 the
 eyes
 of
 all
 them
 that
 were
 in
 the
 synagogue
 were
 fastened
 on
 him
 The
 scripture
 He
 had
 quoted
 was
 one
 recognized
 by
 all
 classes
 as
 specifically
 referring
 to
 the
 Messiah
 for
 whose
 coming
 the
 nation
 waited
 The
 first
 sentence
 of
 our
 Lords
 commentary
 was
 startling
 it
 involved
 no
 labored
 analysis
 no
 scholastic
 interpretation
 but
 a
 direct
 and
 unambiguous
 application
 This
 day
 is
 this
 scripture
 fulfilled
 in
 your
 ears
 There
 was
 such
 graciousness
 in
 His
 words
 that
 all
 wondered
 and
 they
 said
 Is
 not
 this
 Josephs
 son
 Jesus
 knew
 their
 thoughts
 even
 if
 He
 heard
 not
 their
 words
 and
 forestalling
 their
 criticism
 He
 said
 Ye
 will
 surely
 say
 unto
 me
 this
 proverb
 Physician
 heal
 thyself
 whatsoever
 we
 have
 heard
 done
 in
 Capernaum
 do
 also
 here
 in
 thy
 country
 And
 he
 said
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 No
 prophet
 is
 accepted
 in
 his
 own
 country
 In
 their
 hearts
 the
 people
 were
 eager
 for
 a
 sign
 a
 wonder
 a
 miracle
 They
 knew
 that
 Jesus
 had
 wrought
 such
 in
 Cana
 and
 a
 boy
 in
 Capernaum
 had
 been
 healed
 by
 His
 word
 at
 Jerusalem
 too
 He
 had
 astonished
 the
 people
 with
 mighty
 works
 Were
 they
 His
 townsmen
 to
 be
 slighted
 Why
 would
 He
 not
 treat
 them
 to
 some
 entertaining
 exhibition
 of
 His
 powers
 He
 continued
 His
 address
 reminding
 them
 that
 in
 the
 days
 of
 Elijah
 when
 for
 three
 years
 and
 a
 half
 no
 rain
 had
 fallen
 and
 famine
 had
 reigned
 the
 prophet
 had
 been
 sent
 to
 but
 one
 of
 the
 many
 widows
 and
 she
 a
 woman
 of
 Sarepta
 in
 Sidon
 a
 Gentile
 not
 a
 daughter
 of
 Israel
 And
 again
 though
 there
 had
 been
 many
 lepers
 in
 Israel
 in
 the
 days
 of
 Elisha
 but
 one
 leper
 and
 he
 a
 Syrian
 not
 an
 Israelite
 had
 been
 cleansed
 through
 the
 prophets
 ministration
 for
 Naaman
 alone
 had
 manifested
 the
 requisite
 faith
 Then
 great
 was
 their
 wrath
 Did
 He
 dare
 to
 class
 them
 with
 Gentiles
 and
 lepers
 Were
 they
 to
 be
 likened
 unto
 despized
 unbelievers
 and
 that
 too
 by
 the
 son
 of
 the
 village
 carpenter
 who
 had
 grown
 from
 childhood
 in
 their
 community
 Victims
 of
 diabolical
 rage
 they
 seized
 the
 Lord
 and
 took
 Him
 to
 the
 brow
 of
 the
 hill
 on
 the
 slopes
 of
 which
 the
 town
 was
 built
 determined
 to
 avenge
 their
 wounded
 feelings
 by
 hurling
 Him
 from
 the
 rocky
 cliffs
 Thus
 early
 in
 His
 ministry
 did
 the
 forces
 of
 opposition
 attain
 murderous
 intensity
 But
 our
 Lords
 time
 to
 die
 had
 not
 yet
 come
 The
 infuriated
 mob
 was
 powerless
 to
 go
 one
 step
 farther
 than
 their
 supposed
 victim
 would
 permit
 But
 he
 passing
 through
 the
 midst
 of
 them
 went
 his
 way
 Whether
 they
 were
 overawed
 by
 the
 grace
 of
 His
 presence
 silenced
 by
 the
 power
 of
 His
 words
 or
 stayed
 by
 some
 more
 appalling
 intervention
 we
 are
 not
 informed
 He
 departed
 from
 the
 unbelieving
 Nazarenes
 and
 thenceforth
 Nazareth
 was
 no
 longer
 His
 home
 IN
 CAPERNAUM
 Jesus
 wended
 His
 way
 to
 Capernaum
 which
 became
 to
 Him
 as
 nearly
 a
 place
 of
 abode
 as
 any
 He
 had
 in
 Galilee
 There
 He
 taught
 particularly
 on
 Sabbath
 days
 and
 the
 people
 were
 astonished
 at
 His
 doctrine
 for
 He
 spoke
 with
 authority
 and
 power
 In
 the
 synagog
 on
 one
 of
 these
 occasions
 was
 a
 man
 who
 was
 a
 victim
 of
 possession
 and
 subject
 to
 the
 ravages
 of
 an
 evil
 spirit
 or
 as
 the
 text
 so
 forcefully
 states
 one
 who
 had
 a
 spirit
 of
 an
 unclean
 devil
 It
 is
 significant
 that
 this
 wicked
 spirit
 which
 had
 gained
 such
 power
 over
 the
 man
 as
 to
 control
 his
 actions
 and
 utterances
 was
 terrified
 before
 our
 Lord
 and
 cried
 out
 with
 a
 loud
 voice
 though
 pleadingly
 Let
 us
 alone
 what
 have
 we
 to
 do
 with
 thee
 thou
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 art
 thou
 come
 to
 destroy
 us
 I
 know
 thee
 who
 thou
 art
 the
 Holy
 One
 of
 God
 Jesus
 rebuked
 the
 unclean
 spirit
 commanding
 him
 to
 be
 silent
 and
 to
 leave
 the
 man
 the
 demon
 obeyed
 the
 Master
 and
 after
 throwing
 the
 victim
 into
 violent
 though
 harmless
 paroxysm
 left
 him
 Such
 a
 miracle
 caused
 the
 beholders
 to
 wonder
 the
 more
 and
 they
 exclaimed
 What
 a
 word
 is
 this
 for
 with
 authority
 and
 power
 he
 commandeth
 the
 unclean
 spirits
 and
 they
 come
 out
 And
 the
 fame
 of
 him
 went
 out
 into
 every
 place
 of
 the
 country
 round
 about
 In
 the
 evening
 of
 the
 same
 day
 when
 the
 sun
 had
 set
 and
 therefore
 after
 the
 Sabbath
 had
 passed
 the
 people
 flocked
 about
 Him
 bringing
 their
 afflicted
 friends
 and
 kindred
 and
 these
 Jesus
 healed
 of
 their
 divers
 maladies
 whether
 of
 body
 or
 of
 mind
 Among
 those
 so
 relieved
 were
 many
 who
 had
 been
 possessed
 of
 devils
 and
 these
 cried
 out
 testifying
 perforce
 of
 the
 Masters
 divine
 authority
 Thou
 art
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 On
 these
 as
 on
 other
 occasions
 we
 find
 evil
 spirits
 voicing
 through
 the
 mouths
 of
 their
 victims
 their
 knowledge
 that
 Jesus
 was
 the
 Christ
 and
 in
 all
 such
 instances
 the
 Lord
 silenced
 them
 with
 a
 word
 for
 He
 wanted
 no
 such
 testimony
 as
 theirs
 to
 attest
 the
 fact
 of
 His
 Godship
 Those
 spirits
 were
 of
 the
 devils
 following
 members
 of
 the
 rebellious
 and
 defeated
 hosts
 that
 had
 been
 cast
 down
 through
 the
 power
 of
 the
 very
 Being
 whose
 authority
 and
 power
 they
 now
 acknowledged
 in
 their
 demoniac
 frenzy
 Together
 with
 Satan
 himself
 their
 vanquished
 chief
 they
 remained
 unembodied
 for
 to
 all
 of
 them
 the
 privileges
 of
 the
 second
 or
 mortal
 estate
 had
 been
 denied
 their
 remembrance
 of
 the
 scenes
 that
 had
 culminated
 in
 their
 expulsion
 from
 heaven
 was
 quickened
 by
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 Christ
 though
 He
 stood
 in
 a
 body
 of
 flesh
 Many
 modern
 writers
 have
 attempted
 to
 explain
 the
 phenomenon
 of
 demoniacal
 possession
 and
 beside
 these
 there
 are
 not
 a
 few
 who
 deny
 the
 possibility
 of
 actual
 domination
 of
 the
 victim
 by
 spirit
 personages
 Yet
 the
 scriptures
 are
 explicit
 in
 showing
 the
 contrary
 Our
 Lord
 distinguished
 between
 this
 form
 of
 affliction
 and
 that
 of
 simple
 bodily
 disease
 in
 His
 instructions
 to
 the
 Twelve
 Heal
 the
 sick
 cleanse
 the
 lepers
 raise
 the
 dead
 cast
 out
 devils
 In
 the
 account
 of
 the
 incidents
 under
 consideration
 the
 evangelist
 Mark
 observes
 the
 same
 distinction
 thus
 They
 brought
 unto
 him
 all
 that
 were
 diseased
 and
 them
 that
 were
 possessed
 with
 devils
 In
 several
 instances
 Christ
 in
 rebuking
 demons
 addressed
 them
 as
 individuals
 distinct
 from
 the
 human
 being
 afflicted
 and
 in
 one
 such
 instance
 commanded
 the
 demon
 to
 come
 out
 of
 him
 and
 enter
 no
 more
 into
 him
 In
 this
 matter
 as
 in
 others
 the
 simplest
 explanation
 is
 the
 pertinent
 truth
 theory
 raised
 on
 other
 than
 scriptural
 foundation
 is
 unstable
 Christ
 unequivocally
 associated
 demons
 with
 Satan
 specifically
 in
 His
 comment
 on
 the
 report
 of
 the
 Seventy
 whom
 He
 authorized
 and
 sent
 forth
 and
 who
 testified
 with
 joy
 on
 their
 return
 that
 even
 the
 devils
 had
 been
 subject
 unto
 them
 through
 His
 name
 and
 to
 those
 faithful
 servants
 He
 said
 I
 beheld
 Satan
 as
 lightning
 fall
 from
 heaven
 The
 demons
 that
 take
 possession
 of
 men
 overruling
 their
 agency
 and
 compelling
 them
 to
 obey
 Satanic
 bidding
 are
 the
 unembodied
 angels
 of
 the
 devil
 whose
 triumph
 it
 is
 to
 afflict
 mortals
 and
 if
 possible
 to
 impel
 them
 to
 sin
 To
 gain
 for
 themselves
 the
 transitory
 gratification
 of
 tenanting
 a
 body
 of
 flesh
 these
 demons
 are
 eager
 to
 enter
 even
 into
 the
 bodies
 of
 beasts
 Possibly
 it
 was
 during
 the
 interval
 between
 the
 rebuking
 of
 the
 evil
 spirit
 in
 the
 synagog
 and
 the
 miracles
 of
 healing
 and
 casting
 out
 devils
 in
 the
 evening
 of
 that
 Sabbath
 that
 Jesus
 went
 to
 the
 house
 of
 Simon
 whom
 He
 had
 before
 named
 Peter
 and
 there
 found
 the
 motherinlaw
 of
 His
 disciple
 lying
 ill
 of
 fever
 Acceding
 to
 the
 request
 of
 faith
 He
 rebuked
 the
 disease
 the
 woman
 was
 healed
 forthwith
 rose
 from
 her
 bed
 and
 ministered
 the
 hospitality
 of
 her
 home
 unto
 Jesus
 and
 those
 who
 were
 with
 Him

 Animosity
 Between
 Jews
 and
 SamaritansIn
 any
 consideration
 of
 the
 Samaritans
 it
 must
 be
 kept
 in
 mind
 that
 a
 certain
 city
 and
 the
 district
 or
 province
 in
 which
 it
 was
 situated
 were
 both
 known
 as
 Samaria
 The
 principal
 facts
 pertaining
 to
 the
 origin
 of
 the
 Samaritans
 and
 the
 explanation
 of
 the
 mutual
 animosity
 existing
 between
 that
 people
 and
 the
 Jews
 in
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 have
 been
 admirably
 summarized
 by
 Geikie
 Life
 and
 Words
 of

 pp
 
 Omitting
 his
 citation
 of
 authorities
 we
 quote
 After
 the
 deportation
 of
 the
 Ten
 Tribes
 to
 Assyria
 Samaria
 had
 been
 repeopled
 by
 heathen
 colonists
 from
 various
 provinces
 of
 the
 Assyrian
 empire
 by
 fugitives
 from
 the
 authorities
 of
 Judea
 and
 by
 stragglers
 of
 one
 or
 other
 of
 the
 Ten
 Tribes
 who
 found
 their
 way
 home
 again
 The
 first
 heathen
 settlers
 terrified
 at
 the
 increase
 of
 wild
 animals
 especially
 lions
 and
 attributing
 it
 to
 their
 not
 knowing
 the
 proper
 worship
 of
 the
 God
 of
 the
 country
 sent
 for
 one
 of
 the
 exiled
 priests
 and
 under
 his
 instructions
 added
 the
 worship
 of
 Jehovah
 to
 that
 of
 their
 idolsan
 incident
 in
 their
 history
 from
 which
 later
 Jewish
 hatred
 and
 derision
 taunted
 them
 as
 proselytes
 of
 the
 lions
 as
 it
 branded
 them
 from
 their
 Assyrian
 origin
 with
 the
 name
 of
 Cuthites
 Ultimately
 however
 they
 became
 even
 more
 rigidly
 attached
 to
 the
 Law
 of
 Moses
 than
 the
 Jews
 themselves
 Anxious
 to
 be
 recognized
 as
 Israelites
 they
 set
 their
 hearts
 on
 joining
 the
 Two
 Tribes
 on
 their
 return
 from
 captivity
 but
 the
 stern
 Puritanism
 of
 Ezra
 and
 Nehemiah
 admitted
 no
 alliance
 between
 the
 pure
 blood
 of
 Jerusalem
 and
 the
 tainted
 race
 of
 the
 north
 Resentment
 at
 this
 affront
 was
 natural
 and
 excited
 resentment
 in
 return
 till
 in
 Christs
 day
 centuries
 of
 strife
 and
 mutual
 injury
 intensified
 by
 theological
 hatred
 on
 both
 sides
 had
 made
 them
 implacable
 enemies
 The
 Samaritans
 had
 built
 a
 temple
 on
 Mount
 Gerizim
 to
 rival
 that
 of
 Jerusalem
 but
 it
 had
 been
 destroyed
 by
 John
 Hyrcanus
 who
 had
 also
 levelled
 Samaria
 to
 the
 ground
 They
 claimed
 for
 their
 mountain
 a
 greater
 holiness
 than
 that
 of
 Moriah
 accused
 the
 Jews
 of
 adding
 to
 the
 word
 of
 God
 by
 receiving
 the
 writings
 of
 the
 prophets
 and
 prided
 themselves
 on
 owning
 only
 the
 Pentateuch
 as
 inspired
 favoured
 Herod
 because
 the
 Jews
 hated
 him
 and
 were
 loyal
 to
 him
 and
 the
 equally
 hated
 Romans
 had
 kindled
 false
 lights
 on
 the
 hills
 to
 vitiate
 the
 Jewish
 reckoning
 by
 the
 new
 moons
 and
 thus
 throw
 their
 feasts
 into
 confusion
 and
 in
 the
 early
 youth
 of
 Jesus
 had
 even
 defiled
 the
 very
 Temple
 itself
 by
 strewing
 human
 bones
 in
 it
 at
 the
 Passover
 Nor
 had
 hatred
 slumbered
 on
 the
 side
 of
 the
 Jews
 They
 knew
 the
 Samaritans
 only
 as
 Cuthites
 or
 heathens
 from
 Cuth
 The
 race
 that
 I
 hate
 is
 no
 race
 says
 the
 son
 of
 Sirach
 It
 was
 held
 that
 a
 people
 who
 once
 had
 worshipped
 five
 gods
 could
 have
 no
 part
 in
 Jehovah
 The
 claim
 of
 the
 Samaritans
 that
 Moses
 had
 buried
 the
 Tabernacle
 and
 its
 vessels
 on
 the
 top
 of
 Gerizim
 was
 laughed
 to
 scorn
 It
 was
 said
 that
 they
 had
 dedicated
 their
 temple
 under
 Antiochus
 Epiphanes
 to
 the
 Greek
 Jupiter
 Their
 keeping
 the
 commands
 of
 Moses
 even
 more
 strictly
 than
 the
 Jews
 that
 it
 might
 seem
 they
 were
 really
 of
 Israel
 was
 not
 denied
 but
 their
 heathenism
 it
 was
 said
 had
 been
 proved
 by
 the
 discovery
 of
 a
 brazen
 dove
 which
 they
 worshipped
 on
 the
 top
 of
 Gerizim
 It
 would
 have
 been
 enough
 that
 they
 boasted
 of
 Herod
 as
 their
 good
 king
 who
 had
 married
 a
 daughter
 of
 their
 people
 that
 he
 had
 been
 free
 to
 follow
 in
 their
 country
 his
 Roman
 tastes
 so
 hated
 in
 Judea
 that
 they
 had
 remained
 quiet
 after
 his
 death
 when
 Judea
 and
 Galilee
 were
 in
 uproar
 and
 that
 for
 their
 peacefulness
 a
 fourth
 of
 their
 taxes
 had
 been
 remitted
 and
 added
 to
 the
 burdens
 of
 Judea
 Their
 friendliness
 to
 the
 Romans
 was
 an
 additional
 provocation
 While
 the
 Jews
 were
 kept
 quiet
 only
 by
 the
 sternest
 severity
 and
 strove
 to
 the
 utmost
 against
 the
 introduction
 of
 anything
 foreign
 the
 Samaritans
 rejoiced
 in
 the
 new
 importance
 which
 their
 loyalty
 to
 the
 empire
 had
 given
 them
 Shechem
 flourished
 close
 by
 in
 Csarea
 the
 procurator
 held
 his
 court
 a
 division
 of
 cavalry
 in
 barracks
 at
 Sebastethe
 old
 Samariahad
 been
 raised
 in
 the
 territory
 The
 Roman
 strangers
 were
 more
 than
 welcome
 to
 while
 away
 the
 summer
 in
 their
 umbrageous
 valleys
 The
 illimitable
 hatred
 rising
 from
 so
 many
 sources
 found
 vent
 in
 the
 tradition
 that
 a
 special
 curse
 had
 been
 uttered
 against
 the
 Samaritans
 by
 Ezra
 Zerubbabel
 and
 Joshua
 It
 was
 said
 that
 these
 great
 ones
 assembled
 the
 whole
 congregation
 of
 Israel
 in
 the
 Temple
 and
 that
 three
 hundred
 priests
 with
 three
 hundred
 trumpets
 and
 three
 hundred
 books
 of
 the
 Law
 and
 three
 hundred
 scholars
 of
 the
 Law
 had
 been
 employed
 to
 repeat
 amidst
 the
 most
 solemn
 ceremonial
 all
 the
 curses
 of
 the
 Law
 against
 the
 Samaritans
 They
 had
 been
 subjected
 to
 every
 form
 of
 excommunication
 by
 the
 incommunicable
 name
 of
 Jehovah
 by
 the
 Tables
 of
 the
 Law
 and
 by
 the
 heavenly
 and
 earthly
 synagogues
 The
 very
 name
 became
 a
 reproach
 We
 know
 that
 Thou
 art
 a
 Samaritan
 and
 hast
 a
 devil
 said
 the
 Jews
 to
 Jesus
 in
 Jerusalem
 A
 Samaritan
 egg
 as
 the
 hen
 laid
 it
 could
 not
 be
 unclean
 but
 what
 of
 a
 boiled
 egg
 Yet
 interest
 and
 convenience
 strove
 by
 subtle
 casuistry
 to
 invent
 excuses
 for
 what
 intercourse
 was
 unavoidable
 The
 country
 of
 the
 Cuthites
 was
 clean
 so
 that
 a
 Jew
 might
 without
 scruple
 gather
 and
 eat
 its
 produce
 The
 waters
 of
 Samaria
 were
 clean
 so
 that
 a
 Jew
 might
 drink
 them
 or
 wash
 in
 them
 Their
 dwellings
 were
 clean
 so
 that
 he
 might
 enter
 them
 and
 eat
 or
 lodge
 in
 them
 Their
 roads
 were
 clean
 so
 that
 the
 dust
 of
 them
 did
 not
 defile
 a
 Jews
 feet
 The
 Rabbis
 even
 went
 so
 far
 in
 their
 contradictory
 utterances
 as
 to
 say
 that
 the
 victuals
 of
 the
 Cuthites
 were
 allowed
 if
 none
 of
 their
 wine
 or
 vinegar
 were
 mixed
 with
 them
 and
 even
 their
 unleavened
 bread
 was
 to
 be
 reckoned
 fit
 for
 use
 at
 the
 Passover
 Opinions
 thus
 wavered
 but
 as
 a
 rule
 harsher
 feeling
 prevailed
 That
 the
 hostile
 sentiment
 has
 continued
 unto
 this
 day
 at
 least
 on
 the
 part
 of
 the
 Jews
 is
 affirmed
 by
 Frankl
 and
 others
 Thus
 as
 quoted
 by
 Farrar
 p
 
 note
 Are
 you
 a
 Jew
 asked
 Salameh
 Cohen
 the
 Samaritan
 high
 priest
 of
 Dr
 Frankl
 and
 do
 you
 come
 to
 us

 Samaritans
 who
 are
 despised
 by
 the
 Jews

 the
 East

 He
 added
 that
 they
 would
 willingly
 live
 in
 friendship
 with
 the
 Jews
 but
 that
 the
 Jews
 avoided
 all
 intercourse
 with
 them
 Soon
 after
 visiting
 Sepharedish
 Jews
 of
 Nablous
 Dr
 Frankl
 asked
 one
 of
 that
 sect
 if
 he
 had
 any
 intercourse
 with
 the
 Samaritans
 The
 women
 retreated
 with
 a
 cry
 of
 horror
 and
 one
 of
 them
 said
 Have
 you
 been
 among
 the
 worshipers
 of
 the
 pigeons
 I
 said
 that
 I
 had
 The
 women
 again
 fell
 back
 with
 the
 same
 expression
 of
 repugnance
 and
 one
 of
 them
 said
 Take
 a
 purifying
 bath
 idem
 p
 
 Canon
 Farrar
 adds
 I
 had
 the
 pleasure
 of
 spending
 a
 day
 among
 the
 Samaritans
 encamped
 on
 Mount
 Gerizim
 for
 their
 annual
 passover
 and
 neither
 in
 their
 habits
 nor
 apparent
 character
 could
 I
 see
 any
 cause
 for
 all
 this
 horror
 and
 hatred
 
 SycharThe
 town
 where
 dwelt
 the
 Samaritan
 woman
 with
 whom
 Jesus
 conversed
 at
 Jacobs
 well
 is
 named
 Sychar
 in
 John
 
 the
 name
 occurs
 nowhere
 else
 in
 the
 Bible
 Attempts
 have
 been
 made
 to
 identify
 the
 place
 with
 Shechem
 a
 city
 dear
 to
 the
 Jewish
 heart
 because
 of
 its
 prominence
 in
 connection
 with
 the
 lives
 of
 the
 early
 patriarchs
 It
 is
 now
 generally
 admitted
 however
 that
 Sychar
 was
 a
 small
 village
 on
 the
 site
 of
 the
 present
 Askar
 which
 is
 says
 Zenos
 a
 village
 with
 a
 spring
 and
 some
 ancient
 rockhewn
 tombs
 about
 five
 eighths
 of
 a
 mile
 north
 of
 Jacobs

 The
 Nobleman
 of
 CapernaumThe
 name
 of
 the
 nobleman
 whose
 son
 was
 healed
 by
 the
 word
 of
 Jesus
 is
 not
 given
 Attempts
 to
 identify
 him
 with
 Chuza
 the
 steward
 of
 Herod
 Antipas
 are
 based
 on
 unreliable
 tradition
 The
 family
 of
 the
 nobleman
 accepted
 the
 teachings
 of
 Christ
 Joanna
 the
 wife
 of
 Chuza
 Herods
 steward
 Luke
 
 was
 among
 the
 grateful
 and
 honorable
 women
 who
 had
 been
 recipients
 of
 our
 Lords
 healing
 ministry
 and
 who
 contributed
 of
 their
 substance
 for
 the
 furtherance
 of
 His
 work
 Unconfirmed
 tradition
 should
 not
 be
 confounded
 with
 authentic
 history
 
 The
 Targums
 are
 ancient
 Jewish
 paraphrases
 on
 the
 scriptures
 which
 were
 delivered
 in
 the
 synagogs
 in
 the
 languages
 of
 the
 common
 people
 In
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 the
 language
 spoken
 by
 the
 Jews
 was
 not
 Hebrew
 but
 an
 Aramaic
 dialect
 Edersheim
 states
 that
 pure
 Hebrew
 was
 the
 language
 of
 scholars
 and
 of
 the
 synagog
 and
 that
 the
 public
 readings
 from
 the
 scriptures
 had
 to
 be
 rendered
 by
 an
 interpreter
 In
 earliest
 times
 indeed
 says
 he
 it
 was
 forbidden
 to
 the
 Methurgeman
 interpreter
 to
 read
 his
 translation
 or
 to
 write
 down
 a
 Targum
 lest
 the
 paraphrase
 should
 be
 regarded
 as
 of
 equal
 authority
 with
 the
 original
 The
 use
 of
 written
 targums
 was
 authoritatively
 sanctioned
 before
 the
 end
 of
 the
 second
 century
 after
 Christ
 This
 is
 the
 origin
 of
 our
 two
 oldest
 extant
 Targumimthat
 of
 Onkelos
 as
 it
 is
 called
 on
 the
 Pentateuch
 and
 that
 on
 the
 Prophets
 attributed
 to
 Jonathan
 the
 son
 of
 Uzziel
 These
 names
 do
 not
 indeed
 accurately
 represent
 the
 authorship
 of
 the
 oldest
 Targumim
 which
 may
 more
 correctly
 be
 regarded
 as
 later
 and
 authoritative
 recensions
 of
 what
 in
 some
 form
 had
 existed
 before
 But
 although
 these
 works
 had
 their
 origin
 in
 Palestine
 it
 is
 noteworthy
 that
 in
 the
 form
 in
 which
 at
 present
 we
 possess
 them
 they
 are
 the
 outcome
 of
 the
 schools
 of
 Babylon

 and

 CapernaumThe
 name
 Capernaum
 signifies
 according
 to
 some
 authorities
 the
 Village
 of
 Nahum
 according
 to
 others
 the
 Village
 of
 Consolation
 As
 we
 follow
 the
 history
 of
 Jesus
 we
 shall
 discover
 that
 many
 of
 His
 mighty
 works
 were
 wrought
 and
 many
 of
 His
 most
 impressive
 words
 were
 spoken
 in
 Capernaum
 The
 infidelity
 of
 the
 inhabitants
 after
 all
 the
 discourses
 and
 wonderful
 works
 which
 He
 had
 done
 among
 them
 brought
 out
 the
 saying
 of
 Jesus
 And
 thou
 Capernaum
 which
 art
 exalted
 unto
 heaven
 shalt
 be
 cast
 down
 to
 hell
 Matt
 
 So
 thoroughly
 has
 this
 prediction
 been
 fulfilled
 that
 no
 trace
 of
 the
 city
 remains
 and
 the
 very
 site
 which
 it
 occupied
 is
 now
 a
 matter
 of
 conjecture
 there
 being
 even
 no
 ecclesiastical
 tradition
 of
 the
 locality
 At
 the
 present
 day
 two
 spots
 have
 claims
 which
 are
 urged
 each
 with
 such
 arguments
 of
 probability
 as
 to
 make
 the
 whole
 question
 the
 most
 difficult
 in
 sacred
 topography
 We
 shall
 probably
 never
 be
 able
 to
 know
 the
 exact
 fact
 Jesus
 damned
 it
 to
 oblivion
 and
 there
 it
 lies
 We
 shall
 content
 ourselves
 with
 the
 New
 Testament
 notices
 as
 bearing
 on
 the
 work
 of
 Jesus
 We
 learn
 that
 it
 was
 somewhere
 on
 the
 borders
 of
 Zabulun
 and
 Nephtali
 on
 the
 western
 shore
 of
 the
 Sea
 of
 Galilee

 Matt
 
 with
 John

 a
 plain
 about
 three
 miles
 long
 and
 one
 mile
 wide
 which
 we
 learn
 from
 Josephus
 was
 one
 of
 the
 most
 prosperous
 and
 crowded
 districts
 of
 Palestine
 It
 was
 probably
 on
 the
 great
 road
 leading
 from
 Damascus
 to
 the
 south
 by
 the
 way
 of
 the

 Matt
 
 There
 was
 great
 wisdom
 in

 this
 as
 a
 place
 to
 open
 a
 great
 public
 ministry
 It
 was
 full
 of

 Knowledge
 Does
 Not
 Insure
 SalvationJames
 of
 old
 chided
 his
 brethren
 for
 certain
 empty
 professions
 James
 
 Said
 he
 in
 effect
 You
 take
 pride
 and
 satisfaction
 in
 declaring
 your
 belief
 in
 God
 you
 boast
 of
 being
 distinguished
 from
 the
 idolaters
 and
 the
 heathen
 because
 you
 accept
 one
 God
 you
 do
 well
 to
 so
 profess
 and
 so
 believe
 but
 remember
 others
 do
 likewise
 even
 the
 devils
 believe
 and
 we
 may
 add
 so
 firmly
 that
 they
 tremble
 at
 thought
 of
 the
 fate
 which
 that
 belief
 makes
 sure
 Those
 confessions
 of
 the
 devils
 that
 Christ
 was
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 were
 founded
 on
 knowledge
 yet
 their
 knowledge
 of
 the
 great
 truth
 did
 not
 change
 their
 evil
 natures
 How
 different
 was
 their
 acknowledgment
 of
 the
 Savior
 from
 that
 of
 Peter
 who

 made
 so
 desirable
 His

 Father
 and
 of

 as
 the
 Redeemer
 was
 perhaps
 no
 greater
 than
 that
 of

 IN
 GALILEE
 A
 LEPER
 MADE
 CLEAN
 Early
 in
 the
 morning
 following
 that
 eventful
 Sabbath
 in
 Capernaum
 our
 Lord
 arose
 a
 great
 while
 before
 day
 and
 went
 in
 quest
 of
 seclusion
 beyond
 the
 town
 In
 a
 solitary
 place
 He
 gave
 Himself
 to
 prayer
 thus
 demonstrating
 the
 fact
 that
 Messiah
 though
 He
 was
 He
 was
 profoundly
 conscious
 of
 His
 dependence
 upon
 the
 Father
 whose
 work
 He
 had
 come
 to
 do
 Simon
 Peter
 and
 other
 disciples
 found
 the
 place
 of
 His
 retirement
 and
 told
 Him
 of
 the
 eager
 crowds
 who
 sought
 Him
 Soon
 the
 people
 gathered
 about
 Him
 and
 urged
 that
 He
 remain
 with
 them
 but
 he
 said
 unto
 them
 I
 must
 preach
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 to
 other
 cities
 also
 for
 therefore
 am
 I
 sent
 And
 to
 the
 disciples
 He
 said
 Let
 us
 go
 into
 the
 next
 towns
 that
 I
 may
 preach
 there
 also
 for
 therefore
 came
 I
 forth
 Thence
 He
 departed
 accompanied
 by
 the
 few
 whom
 He
 had
 already
 closely
 associated
 with
 Himself
 and
 ministered
 in
 many
 towns
 of
 Galilee
 preaching
 in
 the
 synagogs
 healing
 the
 sick
 and
 casting
 out
 devils
 Among
 the
 afflicted
 seeking
 the
 aid
 that
 He
 alone
 could
 give
 came
 a
 leper
 who
 knelt
 before
 Him
 or
 bowed
 with
 his
 face
 to
 the
 ground
 and
 humbly
 professed
 his
 faith
 saying
 If
 thou
 wilt
 thou
 canst
 make
 me
 clean
 The
 petition
 implied
 in
 the
 words
 of
 this
 poor
 creature
 was
 pathetic
 the
 confidence
 he
 expressed
 is
 inspiring
 The
 question
 in
 his
 mind
 was
 notCan
 Jesus
 heal
 me
 butWill
 He
 heal
 me
 In
 compassionate
 mercy
 Jesus
 laid
 His
 hand
 upon
 the
 sufferer
 unclean
 though
 he
 was
 both
 ceremonially
 and
 physically
 for
 leprosy
 is
 a
 loathsome
 affliction
 and
 we
 know
 that
 this
 man
 was
 far
 advanced
 in
 the
 disease
 since
 we
 are
 told
 that
 he
 was
 full
 of
 leprosy
 Then
 the
 Lord
 said
 I
 will
 be
 thou
 clean
 The
 leper
 was
 immediately
 healed
 Jesus
 instructed
 him
 to
 show
 himself
 to
 the
 priest
 and
 make
 the
 offerings
 prescribed
 in
 the
 law
 of
 Moses
 for
 such
 cases
 as
 his
 In
 this
 instruction
 we
 see
 that
 Christ
 had
 not
 come
 to
 destroy
 the
 law
 but
 as
 He
 affirmed
 at
 another
 time
 to
 fulfil
 it
 and
 at
 this
 stage
 of
 His
 work
 the
 fulfilment
 was
 incomplete
 Moreover
 had
 the
 legal
 requirements
 been
 disregarded
 in
 as
 serious
 a
 matter
 as
 that
 of
 restoring
 an
 outcast
 leper
 to
 the
 society
 of
 the
 community
 from
 which
 he
 had
 been
 debarred
 priestly
 opposition
 already
 waxing
 strong
 and
 threatening
 against
 Jesus
 would
 have
 been
 augmented
 and
 further
 hindrance
 to
 the
 Lords
 work
 might
 have
 resulted
 There
 was
 to
 be
 no
 delay
 in
 the
 mans
 compliance
 with
 the
 Masters
 instruction
 Jesus
 straitly
 charged
 him
 and
 forthwith
 sent
 him
 away
 Furthermore
 He
 explicitly
 directed
 the
 man
 to
 tell
 nobody
 of
 the
 manner
 of
 his
 healing
 There
 was
 perhaps
 good
 reason
 for
 this
 injunction
 of
 silence
 aside
 from
 the
 very
 general
 course
 of
 our
 Lord
 in
 discountenancing
 undesirable
 notoriety
 for
 had
 word
 of
 the
 miracle
 preceded
 the
 mans
 appearing
 before
 the
 priest
 obstacles
 might
 have
 been
 thrown
 in
 the
 way
 of
 his
 Levitical
 recognition
 as
 one
 who
 was
 clean
 The
 man
 however
 could
 not
 keep
 the
 good
 word
 to
 himself
 but
 went
 about
 and
 began
 to
 publish
 it
 much
 and
 to
 blaze
 abroad
 the
 matter
 insomuch
 that
 Jesus
 could
 no
 more
 openly
 enter
 into
 the
 city
 but
 was
 without
 in
 desert
 places
 and
 they
 came
 to
 him
 from
 every
 quarter
 A
 PALSIED
 MAN
 HEALED
 AND
 FORGIVEN
 It
 must
 be
 borne
 in
 mind
 that
 no
 one
 of
 the
 evangelists
 attempts
 to
 give
 a
 detailed
 history
 of
 all
 the
 doings
 of
 Jesus
 nor
 do
 all
 follow
 the
 same
 order
 in
 relating
 the
 incidents
 with
 which
 they
 associate
 the
 great
 lessons
 of
 the
 Masters
 teachings
 There
 is
 much
 uncertainty
 as
 to
 the
 actual
 sequence
 of
 events
 Some
 days
 after
 the
 healing
 of
 the
 leper
 Jesus
 was
 again
 in
 Capernaum
 The
 details
 of
 His
 employment
 during
 the
 interval
 are
 not
 specified
 but
 we
 may
 be
 sure
 that
 His
 work
 continued
 for
 His
 characteristic
 occupation
 was
 that
 of
 going
 about
 doing
 good
 His
 place
 of
 abode
 in
 Capernaum
 was
 well
 known
 and
 word
 was
 soon
 noised
 about
 that
 He
 was
 in
 the
 house
 A
 great
 throng
 gathered
 so
 that
 there
 was
 no
 room
 to
 receive
 them
 even
 the
 doorway
 was
 crowded
 and
 later
 comers
 could
 not
 get
 near
 the
 Master
 To
 all
 who
 were
 within
 hearing
 Jesus
 preached
 the
 gospel
 A
 little
 party
 of
 four
 approached
 the
 house
 bearing
 a
 litter
 or
 pallet
 on
 which
 lay
 a
 man
 afflicted
 with
 palsy
 a
 species
 of
 paralysis
 which
 deprived
 the
 subject
 of
 the
 power
 of
 voluntary
 motion
 and
 usually
 of
 speech
 the
 man
 was
 helpless
 His
 friends
 disappointed
 at
 finding
 themselves
 unable
 to
 reach
 Jesus
 because
 of
 the
 press
 resorted
 to
 an
 unusual
 expedient
 which
 exhibited
 in
 an
 unmistakable
 way
 their
 faith
 in
 the
 Lord
 as
 One
 who
 could
 rebuke
 and
 stay
 disease
 and
 their
 determination
 to
 seek
 the
 desired
 blessing
 at
 His
 hands
 By
 some
 means
 they
 carried
 the
 afflicted
 man
 to
 the
 flat
 roof
 of
 the
 house
 probably
 by
 an
 outside
 stairway
 or
 by
 the
 use
 of
 a
 ladder
 possibly
 by
 entering
 an
 adjoining
 house
 ascending
 the
 stairs
 to
 its
 roof
 and
 crossing
 therefrom
 to
 the
 house
 within
 which
 Jesus
 was
 teaching
 They
 broke
 away
 part
 of
 the
 roof
 making
 an
 opening
 or
 enlarging
 that
 of
 the
 trapdoor
 such
 as
 the
 houses
 of
 that
 place
 and
 time
 were
 usually
 provided
 with
 and
 to
 the
 surprize
 of
 the
 assembled
 crowd
 they
 then
 let
 down
 through
 the
 tiling
 the
 portable
 couch
 upon
 which
 the
 palsied
 sufferer
 lay
 Jesus
 was
 deeply
 impressed
 by
 the
 faith
 and
 works
 of
 those
 who
 had
 thus
 labored
 to
 place
 a
 helpless
 paralytic
 before
 Him
 doubtless
 too
 He
 knew
 of
 the
 trusting
 faith
 in
 the
 heart
 of
 the
 sufferer
 and
 looking
 compassionately
 upon
 the
 man
 He
 said
 Son
 thy
 sins
 be
 forgiven
 thee
 Among
 the
 people
 there
 assembled
 were
 scribes
 Pharisees
 and
 doctors
 of
 the
 law
 not
 only
 representatives
 of
 the
 local
 synagog
 but
 some
 who
 had
 come
 from
 distant
 towns
 in
 Galilee
 and
 some
 from
 Judea
 and
 even
 from
 Jerusalem
 The
 official
 class
 had
 opposed
 our
 Lord
 and
 His
 works
 on
 earlier
 occasions
 and
 their
 presence
 in
 the
 house
 at
 this
 time
 boded
 further
 unfriendly
 criticism
 and
 possible
 obstruction
 They
 heard
 the
 words
 spoken
 to
 the
 paralytic
 and
 were
 angered
 thereat
 In
 their
 hearts
 they
 accused
 Jesus
 of
 the
 awful
 offense
 of
 blasphemy
 which
 consists
 essentially
 in
 claiming
 for
 human
 or
 demon
 power
 the
 prerogatives
 of
 God
 or
 in
 dishonoring
 God
 by
 ascribing
 to
 Him
 attributes
 short
 of
 perfection
 These
 unbelieving
 scholars
 who
 incessantly
 wrote
 and
 talked
 of
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Messiah
 yet
 rejected
 Him
 when
 He
 was
 there
 present
 murmured
 in
 silence
 saying
 to
 themselves
 Who
 can
 forgive
 sins
 but
 God
 only
 Jesus
 knew
 their
 inmost
 thoughts
 and
 made
 reply
 thereto
 saying
 Why
 reason
 ye
 these
 things
 in
 your
 hearts
 Whether
 is
 it
 easier
 to
 say
 to
 the
 sick
 of
 the
 palsy
 Thy
 sins
 be
 forgiven
 thee
 or
 to
 say
 Arise
 and
 take
 up
 thy
 bed
 and
 walk
 And
 then
 to
 emphasize
 and
 to
 put
 beyond
 question
 His
 possession
 of
 divine
 authority
 He
 added
 But
 that
 ye
 may
 know
 that
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 hath
 power
 on
 earth
 to
 forgive
 sins
 he
 saith
 to
 the
 sick
 of
 the
 palsy
 I
 say
 unto
 thee
 Arise
 and
 take
 up
 thy
 bed
 and
 go
 thy
 way
 into
 thine
 house
 The
 man
 arose
 fully
 restored
 and
 taking
 up
 the
 mattress
 upon
 which
 he
 had
 been
 brought
 walked
 out
 before
 them
 The
 amazement
 of
 the
 people
 was
 mingled
 with
 reverence
 and
 many
 glorified
 God
 of
 whose
 power
 they
 were
 witnesses
 The
 incident
 demands
 our
 further
 study
 According
 to
 one
 of
 the
 accounts
 the
 Lords
 first
 words
 to
 the
 afflicted
 one
 were
 Son
 be
 of
 good
 cheer
 followed
 directly
 by
 the
 comforting
 and
 authoritative
 assurance
 Thy
 sins
 be
 given
 thee
 The
 man
 was
 probably
 in
 a
 state
 of
 fear
 he
 may
 have
 known
 that
 his
 ailment
 was
 the
 result
 of
 wicked
 indulgences
 nevertheless
 though
 he
 may
 have
 considered
 the
 possibility
 of
 hearing
 only
 condemnation
 for
 his
 transgression
 he
 had
 faith
 to
 be
 brought
 In
 this
 mans
 condition
 there
 was
 plainly
 a
 close
 connection
 between
 his
 past
 sins
 and
 his
 present
 affliction
 and
 in
 this
 particular
 his
 case
 is
 not
 unique
 for
 we
 read
 that
 Christ
 admonished
 another
 whom
 He
 healed
 to
 sin
 no
 more
 lest
 a
 worse
 thing
 befall
 him
 We
 are
 not
 warranted
 however
 in
 assuming
 that
 all
 bodily
 ills
 are
 the
 result
 of
 culpable
 sin
 and
 against
 such
 a
 conception
 stands
 the
 Lords
 combined
 instruction
 and
 rebuke
 to
 those
 who
 in
 the
 case
 of
 a
 man
 born
 blind
 asked
 who
 had
 sinned
 the
 man
 or
 his
 parents
 to
 bring
 so
 grievous
 an
 affliction
 upon
 him
 to
 which
 inquiry
 our
 Lord
 replied
 that
 the
 mans
 blindness
 was
 due
 neither
 to
 his
 own
 sin
 nor
 to
 that
 of
 his
 parents
 In
 many
 instances
 however
 disease
 is
 the
 direct
 result
 of
 individual
 sin
 Whatever
 may
 have
 been
 the
 measure
 of
 past
 offense
 on
 the
 part
 of
 the
 man
 suffering
 from
 palsy
 Christ
 recognized
 his
 repentance
 together
 with
 the
 faith
 that
 accompanied
 it
 and
 it
 was
 the
 Lords
 rightful
 prerogative
 to
 decide
 upon
 the
 mans
 fitness
 to
 receive
 remission
 of
 his
 sins
 and
 relief
 from
 his
 bodily
 affliction
 The
 interrogative
 response
 of
 Jesus
 to
 the
 muttered
 criticism
 of
 the
 scribes
 Pharisees
 and
 doctors
 has
 been
 interpreted
 in
 many
 ways
 He
 inquired
 which
 was
 easier
 to
 say
 Thy
 sins
 be
 forgiven
 thee
 or
 to
 say
 Arise
 and
 take
 up
 thy
 bed
 and
 walk
 Is
 it
 not
 a
 rational
 explanation
 that
 when
 spoken
 authoritatively
 by
 Him
 the
 two
 expressions
 were
 of
 allied
 meaning
 The
 circumstance
 should
 have
 been
 a
 sufficient
 demonstration
 to
 all
 who
 heard
 that
 He
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 claimed
 and
 possessed
 the
 right
 and
 the
 power
 to
 remit
 both
 physical
 and
 spiritual
 penalties
 to
 heal
 the
 body
 of
 visible
 disease
 and
 to
 purge
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 no
 less
 real
 malady
 of
 sin
 In
 the
 presence
 of
 people
 of
 all
 classes
 Jesus
 thus
 openly
 asserted
 His
 divinity
 and
 affirmed
 the
 same
 by
 a
 miraculous
 manifestation
 of
 power
 The
 charge
 of
 blasphemy
 which
 the
 rabbinical
 critics
 formulated
 in
 their
 minds
 against
 the
 Christ
 was
 not
 to
 end
 as
 a
 mental
 conception
 of
 theirs
 nor
 to
 be
 nullified
 by
 our
 Lords
 later
 remarks
 It
 was
 through
 perjured
 testimony
 that
 He
 finally
 received
 unrighteous
 condemnation
 and
 was
 sent
 to
 His
 death
 Already
 in
 that
 house
 at
 Capernaum
 the
 shadow
 of
 the
 cross
 had
 fallen
 athwart
 the
 course
 of
 His
 life
 PUBLICANS
 AND
 SINNERS
 From
 the
 house
 Jesus
 repaired
 to
 the
 seaside
 whither
 the
 people
 followed
 Him
 there
 He
 taught
 them
 again
 At
 the
 close
 of
 His
 discourse
 He
 walked
 farther
 and
 saw
 a
 man
 named
 Levi
 one
 of
 the
 publicans
 or
 official
 collectors
 of
 taxes
 sitting
 at
 the
 customhouse
 where
 the
 tariff
 levied
 under
 Roman
 law
 had
 to
 be
 paid
 This
 man
 was
 known
 also
 as
 Matthew
 a
 name
 less
 distinctively
 Jewish
 than
 is
 Levi
 He
 afterward
 became
 one
 of
 the
 Twelve
 and
 the
 author
 of
 the
 first
 of
 the
 evangelical
 Gospels
 To
 him
 Jesus
 said
 Follow
 me
 Matthew
 left
 his
 place
 and
 followed
 the
 Lord
 Some
 time
 later
 the
 new
 disciple
 provided
 a
 great
 feast
 at
 his
 house
 in
 honor
 of
 the
 Master
 and
 other
 disciples
 were
 present
 So
 obnoxious
 to
 the
 Jews
 was
 the
 power
 of
 Rome
 to
 which
 they
 were
 subject
 that
 they
 regarded
 with
 aversion
 all
 officials
 in
 Roman
 employ
 Particularly
 humiliating
 to
 them
 was
 the
 system
 of
 compulsory
 taxation
 by
 which
 they
 the
 people
 of
 Israel
 had
 to
 pay
 tribute
 to
 an
 alien
 nation
 which
 in
 their
 estimation
 was
 wholly
 pagan
 and
 heathen
 Naturally
 the
 collectors
 of
 these
 taxes
 were
 abhorred
 and
 they
 known
 as
 publicans
 probably
 resented
 the
 discourteous
 treatment
 by
 inconsiderate
 enforcement
 of
 the
 tax
 requirements
 and
 as
 affirmed
 by
 historians
 often
 inflicted
 unlawful
 extortion
 upon
 the
 people
 If
 publicans
 in
 general
 were
 detested
 we
 can
 readily
 understand
 how
 bitter
 would
 be
 the
 contempt
 in
 which
 the
 Jews
 would
 hold
 one
 of
 their
 own
 nation
 who
 had
 accepted
 appointment
 as
 such
 an
 official
 In
 this
 unenviable
 status
 was
 Matthew
 when
 Jesus
 called
 him
 The
 publicans
 formed
 a
 distinct
 social
 class
 for
 from
 the
 community
 in
 general
 they
 were
 practically
 ostracized
 All
 who
 associated
 with
 them
 were
 made
 to
 share
 in
 the
 popular
 odium
 and
 publicans
 and
 sinners
 became
 a
 common
 designation
 for
 the
 degraded
 caste
 To
 Matthews
 feast
 many
 of
 his
 friends
 and
 some
 of
 his
 fellow
 officials
 were
 invited
 so
 that
 the
 gathering
 was
 largely
 made
 up
 of
 these
 despized
 publicans
 and
 sinners
 And
 to
 such
 an
 assemblage
 went
 Jesus
 with
 His
 disciples
 The
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 could
 not
 let
 pass
 such
 an
 opportunity
 for
 faultfinding
 and
 caustic
 criticism
 They
 hesitated
 to
 address
 themselves
 directly
 to
 Jesus
 but
 of
 the
 disciples
 they
 asked
 in
 disdain
 Why
 eateth
 your
 Master
 with
 publicans
 and
 sinners
 The
 Master
 heard
 and
 replied
 with
 edifying
 incisiveness
 mingled
 with
 splendid
 irony
 Citing
 one
 of
 the
 common
 aphorisms
 of
 the
 day
 He
 said
 They
 that
 be
 whole
 need
 not
 a
 physician
 but
 they
 that
 are
 sick
 To
 this
 He
 added
 I
 am
 not
 come
 to
 call
 the
 righteous
 but
 sinners
 to
 repentance
 The
 hypercritical
 Pharisees
 were
 left
 to
 make
 their
 own
 application
 of
 the
 rejoinder
 which
 some
 may
 have
 understood
 to
 mean
 that
 their
 selfrighteousness
 was
 arraigned
 and
 their
 claims
 to
 superiority
 derided
 Aside
 from
 the
 veiled
 sarcasm
 in
 the
 Masters
 words
 they
 ought
 to
 have
 perceived
 the
 wisdom
 enshrined
 in
 His
 answer
 and
 to
 have
 profited
 thereby
 Is
 not
 the
 physicians
 place
 among
 the
 afflicted
 ones
 Would
 he
 be
 justified
 in
 keeping
 aloof
 from
 the
 sick
 and
 the
 suffering
 His
 profession
 is
 that
 of
 combating
 disease
 preventing
 when
 possible
 curing
 when
 necessary
 to
 the
 full
 extent
 of
 his
 ability
 If
 the
 festive
 assembly
 at
 Matthews
 house
 really
 did
 comprize
 a
 number
 of
 sinners
 was
 not
 the
 occasion
 one
 of
 rare
 opportunity
 for
 the
 ministrations
 of
 the
 Physician
 of
 Souls
 The
 righteous
 need
 no
 call
 to
 repentance
 but
 are
 the
 sinners
 to
 be
 left
 in
 sin
 because
 those
 who
 profess
 to
 be
 spiritual
 teachers
 will
 not
 condescend
 to
 extend
 a
 helping
 hand
 THE
 OLD
 AND
 THE
 NEW
 Shortly
 after
 the
 entertainment
 provided
 by
 Matthew
 the
 Pharisees
 were
 ready
 with
 another
 criticism
 and
 in
 this
 they
 were
 associated
 with
 some
 of
 the
 Baptists
 adherents
 John
 was
 in
 prison
 but
 many
 of
 those
 who
 had
 been
 drawn
 to
 his
 baptism
 and
 had
 professed
 discipleship
 to
 him
 still
 clung
 to
 his
 teachings
 and
 failed
 to
 see
 that
 the
 Greater
 One
 of
 whom
 he
 had
 testified
 was
 then
 ministering
 amongst
 them
 The
 Baptist
 had
 been
 a
 scrupulous
 observer
 of
 the
 law
 his
 strict
 asceticism
 vied
 with
 the
 rigor
 of
 Pharisaic
 profession
 His
 nonprogressive
 disciples
 now
 left
 without
 a
 leader
 naturally
 fell
 in
 with
 the
 Pharisees
 Some
 of
 Johns
 disciples
 came
 to
 Jesus
 and
 questioned
 Him
 concerning
 His
 seeming
 indifference
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 fasting
 They
 propounded
 a
 plain
 question
 Why
 do
 the
 disciples
 of
 John
 and
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 fast
 but
 thy
 disciples
 fast
 not
 To
 the
 friends
 of
 the
 now
 imprisoned
 Baptist
 our
 Lords
 reply
 must
 have
 brought
 memories
 of
 their
 beloved
 leaders
 words
 when
 he
 had
 compared
 himself
 to
 the
 Bridegrooms
 friend
 and
 had
 plainly
 told
 them
 who
 was
 the
 real
 Bridegroom
 Jesus
 said
 unto
 them
 Can
 the
 children
 of
 the
 bridechamber
 fast
 while
 the
 bridegroom
 is
 with
 them
 as
 long
 as
 they
 have
 the
 bridegroom
 with
 them
 they
 cannot
 fast
 But
 the
 days
 will
 come
 when
 the
 bridegroom
 shall
 be
 taken
 away
 from
 them
 and
 then
 shall
 they
 fast
 in
 those
 days
 If
 the
 questioners
 were
 able
 to
 comprehend
 the
 true
 import
 of
 this
 reply
 they
 could
 not
 fail
 to
 find
 therein
 an
 implied
 abrogation
 of
 purely
 ceremonial
 observances
 comprized
 in
 the
 code
 of
 rabbinical
 rules
 and
 the
 numerous
 traditions
 associated
 with
 the
 law
 But
 to
 make
 the
 subject
 clearer
 to
 their
 biased
 minds
 Jesus
 gave
 them
 illustrations
 which
 may
 be
 classed
 as
 parabolic
 No
 man
 also
 said
 He
 seweth
 a
 piece
 of
 new
 cloth
 on
 an
 old
 garment
 else
 the
 new
 piece
 that
 filled
 it
 up
 taketh
 away
 from
 the
 old
 and
 the
 rent
 is
 made
 worse
 And
 no
 man
 putteth
 new
 wine
 into
 old
 bottles
 else
 the
 new
 wine
 doth
 burst
 the
 bottles
 and
 the
 wine
 is
 spilled
 and
 the
 bottles
 will
 be
 marred
 but
 new
 wine
 must
 be
 put
 into
 new
 bottles
 In
 such
 wise
 did
 our
 Lord
 proclaim
 the
 newness
 and
 completeness
 of
 His
 gospel
 It
 was
 in
 no
 sense
 a
 patching
 up
 of
 Judaism
 He
 had
 not
 come
 to
 mend
 old
 and
 torn
 garments
 the
 cloth
 He
 provided
 was
 new
 and
 to
 sew
 it
 on
 the
 old
 would
 be
 but
 to
 tear
 afresh
 the
 threadbare
 fabric
 and
 leave
 a
 more
 unsightly
 rent
 than
 at
 first
 Or
 to
 change
 the
 figure
 new
 wine
 could
 not
 safely
 be
 entrusted
 to
 old
 bottles
 The
 bottles
 here
 referred
 to
 were
 really
 bags
 made
 of
 the
 skins
 of
 animals
 and
 of
 course
 they
 deteriorated
 with
 age
 Just
 as
 old
 leather
 splits
 or
 tears
 under
 even
 slight
 strain
 so
 the
 old
 bottleskins
 would
 burst
 from
 the
 pressure
 of
 fermenting
 juice
 and
 the
 good
 wine
 would
 be
 lost
 The
 gospel
 taught
 by
 Christ
 was
 a
 new
 revelation
 superseding
 the
 past
 and
 marking
 the
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 law
 it
 was
 no
 mere
 addendum
 nor
 was
 it
 a
 reenactment
 of
 past
 requirements
 it
 embodied
 a
 new
 and
 an
 everlasting
 covenant
 Attempts
 to
 patch
 the
 Judaistic
 robe
 of
 traditionalism
 with
 the
 new
 fabric
 of
 the
 covenant
 could
 result
 in
 nothing
 more
 sightly
 than
 a
 rending
 of
 the
 fabric
 The
 new
 wine
 of
 the
 gospel
 could
 not
 be
 held
 in
 the
 old
 timeworn
 containers
 of
 Mosaic
 libations
 Judaism
 would
 be
 belittled
 and
 Christianity
 perverted
 by
 any
 such
 incongruous
 association
 FISHERS
 OF
 MEN
 It
 is
 improbable
 that
 the
 disciples
 who
 followed
 Jesus
 in
 the
 early
 months
 of
 His
 ministry
 had
 remained
 with
 Him
 continuously
 down
 to
 the
 time
 now
 under
 consideration
 We
 find
 that
 some
 of
 those
 who
 were
 later
 called
 to
 the
 apostleship
 were
 following
 their
 vocation
 as
 fishermen
 even
 while
 Jesus
 was
 actively
 engaged
 as
 a
 Teacher
 in
 their
 own
 neighborhood
 One
 day
 as
 the
 Lord
 stood
 by
 the
 lake
 or
 sea
 of
 Galilee
 the
 people
 pressed
 about
 Him
 in
 great
 numbers
 eager
 to
 hear
 more
 of
 the
 wondrous
 words
 He
 was
 wont
 to
 speak
 Near
 the
 place
 were
 two
 fishing
 boats
 drawn
 in
 upon
 the
 beach
 the
 owners
 were
 close
 by
 washing
 and
 mending
 their
 nets
 One
 of
 the
 boats
 belonged
 to
 Simon
 Peter
 who
 had
 already
 become
 identified
 with
 the
 Masters
 work
 this
 boat
 Jesus
 entered
 and
 then
 asked
 Simon
 to
 thrust
 out
 a
 little
 from
 the
 land
 Seating
 Himself
 as
 teachers
 of
 that
 time
 usually
 did
 in
 delivering
 discourses
 the
 Lord
 preached
 from
 this
 floating
 pulpit
 to
 the
 multitude
 on
 shore
 The
 subject
 of
 the
 address
 is
 not
 given
 us
 When
 the
 sermon
 was
 ended
 Jesus
 directed
 Simon
 to
 launch
 out
 into
 deep
 water
 and
 then
 let
 down
 the
 nets
 for
 a
 draught
 Presumably
 Andrew
 was
 with
 his
 brother
 and
 possibly
 other
 assistants
 were
 in
 the
 boat
 Simon
 replied
 to
 Jesus
 Master
 we
 have
 toiled
 all
 the
 night
 and
 have
 taken
 nothing
 nevertheless
 at
 thy
 word
 I
 will
 let
 down
 the
 net
 It
 was
 soon
 filled
 with
 fishes
 so
 great
 was
 the
 haul
 that
 the
 net
 began
 to
 break
 and
 the
 busy
 fishermen
 signalled
 to
 those
 in
 the
 other
 boat
 to
 come
 to
 their
 assistance
 The
 catch
 filled
 both
 boats
 so
 that
 they
 appeared
 to
 be
 in
 danger
 of
 sinking
 Simon
 Peter
 was
 overcome
 with
 this
 new
 evidence
 of
 the
 Masters
 power
 and
 falling
 at
 the
 feet
 of
 Jesus
 he
 exclaimed
 Depart
 from
 me
 for
 I
 am
 a
 sinful
 man
 O
 Lord
 Jesus
 answered
 graciously
 and
 with
 promise
 Fear
 not
 from
 henceforth
 thou
 shalt
 catch
 men
 The
 occupants
 of
 the
 second
 boat
 were
 Zebedee
 and
 his
 two
 sons
 James
 and
 John
 the
 last
 named
 being
 he
 who
 with
 Andrew
 had
 left
 the
 Baptist
 to
 follow
 Jesus
 at
 the
 Jordan
 Zebedee
 and
 his
 sons
 were
 partners
 with
 Simon
 in
 the
 fishing
 business
 When
 the
 two
 boats
 were
 brought
 to
 land
 the
 brothers
 Simon
 and
 Andrew
 and
 Zebedees
 two
 sons
 James
 and
 John
 left
 their
 boats
 and
 accompanied
 Jesus
 The
 foregoing
 treatment
 is
 based
 on
 Lukes
 record
 the
 briefer
 and
 less
 circumstantial
 accounts
 given
 by
 Matthew
 and
 Mark
 omit
 the
 incident
 of
 the
 miraculous
 draught
 of
 fishes
 and
 emphasize
 the
 calling
 of
 the
 fishermen
 To
 Simon
 and
 Andrew
 Jesus
 said
 Come
 ye
 after
 me
 and
 I
 will
 make
 you
 to
 become
 fishers
 of
 men
 The
 contrast
 thus
 presented
 between
 their
 former
 vocation
 and
 their
 new
 calling
 is
 strikingly
 forceful
 Theretofore
 they
 had
 caught
 fish
 and
 the
 fate
 of
 the
 fish
 was
 death
 thereafter
 they
 were
 to
 draw
 mento
 a
 life
 eternal
 To
 James
 and
 John
 the
 call
 was
 no
 less
 definite
 and
 they
 too
 left
 their
 all
 to
 follow
 the
 Master
 NOTES

 CHAPTER
 
 
 LeprosyIn
 Biblical
 usage
 this
 name
 is
 applied
 to
 several
 diseases
 all
 however
 having
 some
 symptoms
 in
 common
 at
 least
 in
 the
 earlier
 stages
 of
 the
 malady
 The
 real
 leprosy
 is
 a
 scourge
 and
 a
 plague
 in
 many
 oriental
 lands
 today
 Zenos
 in
 Standard
 Bible
 Dict
 says
 True
 leprosy
 as
 known
 in
 modern
 times
 is
 an
 affection
 characterized
 by
 the
 appearance
 of
 nodules
 in
 the
 eyebrows
 the
 cheeks
 the
 nose
 and
 the
 lobes
 of
 the
 ears
 also
 in
 the
 hands
 and
 feet
 where
 the
 disease
 eats
 into
 the
 joints
 causing
 the
 falling
 off
 of
 fingers
 and
 toes
 If
 nodules
 do
 not
 appear
 their
 place
 is
 taken
 by
 spots
 of
 blanched
 or
 discolored
 skin
 Mascular
 leprosy
 Both
 forms
 are
 based
 upon
 a
 functional
 degeneration
 of
 the
 nerves
 of
 the
 skin
 Its
 cause
 was
 discovered
 by
 Hansen
 in
 
 to
 be
 a
 specific
 bacillus
 Defective
 diet
 however
 seems
 to
 serve
 as
 a
 favorable
 condition
 for
 the
 culture
 of
 the
 bacillus
 Leprosy
 was
 one
 of
 the
 few
 abnormal
 conditions
 of
 the
 body
 which
 the
 Levitical
 law
 declared
 unclean
 Elaborate
 provision
 was
 therefore
 made
 for
 testing
 its
 existence
 and
 for
 the
 purification
 of
 those
 who
 were
 cured
 of
 it
 Deems
 Light
 of
 the
 Nations
 p
 
 summing
 up
 the
 conditions
 incident
 to
 the
 advanced
 stages
 of
 the
 dread
 disease
 writes
 The
 symptoms
 and
 the
 effects
 of
 this
 disease
 are
 very
 loathsome
 There
 comes
 a
 white
 swelling
 or
 scab
 with
 a
 change
 of
 the
 color
 of
 the
 hair
 on
 the
 part
 from
 its
 natural
 hue
 to
 yellow
 then
 the
 appearance
 of
 a
 taint
 going
 deeper
 than
 the
 skin
 or
 raw
 flesh
 appearing
 in
 the
 swelling
 Then
 it
 spreads
 and
 attacks
 the
 cartilaginous
 portions
 of
 the
 body
 The
 nails
 loosen
 and
 drop
 off
 the
 gums
 are
 absorbed
 and
 the
 teeth
 decay
 and
 fall
 out
 the
 breath
 is
 a
 stench
 the
 nose
 decays
 fingers
 hands
 feet
 may
 be
 lost
 or
 the
 eyes
 eaten
 out
 The
 human
 beauty
 has
 gone
 into
 corruption
 and
 the
 patient
 feels
 that
 he
 is
 being
 eaten
 as
 by
 a
 fiend
 who
 consumes
 him
 slowly
 in
 a
 long
 remorseless
 meal
 that
 will
 not
 end
 until
 he
 be
 destroyed
 He
 is
 shut
 out
 from
 his
 fellows
 As
 they
 approach
 he
 must
 cry
 Unclean
 unclean
 that
 all
 humanity
 may
 be
 warned
 from
 his
 precincts
 He
 must
 abandon
 wife
 and
 child
 He
 must
 go
 to
 live
 with
 other
 lepers
 in
 disheartening
 view
 of
 miseries
 similar
 to
 his
 own
 He
 must
 dwell
 in
 dismantled
 houses
 or
 in
 the
 tombs
 He
 is
 as
 Trench
 says
 a
 dreadful
 parable
 of
 death
 By
 the
 laws
 of
 Moses
 Lev
 
 Numb
 
 Ezek
 
 he
 was
 compelled
 as
 if
 he
 were
 mourning
 for
 his
 own
 decease
 to
 bear
 about
 him
 the
 emblems
 of
 death
 the
 rent
 garments
 he
 was
 to
 keep
 his
 head
 bare
 and
 his
 lip
 covered
 as
 was
 the
 custom
 with
 those
 who
 were
 in
 communion
 with
 the
 dead
 When
 the
 Crusaders
 brought
 the
 leprosy
 from
 the
 East
 it
 was
 usual
 to
 clothe
 the
 leper
 in
 a
 shroud
 and
 to
 say
 for
 him
 the
 masses
 for
 the
 dead
 In
 all
 ages
 this
 indescribably
 horrible
 malady
 has
 been
 considered
 incurable
 The
 Jews
 believed
 that
 it
 was
 inflicted
 by
 Jehovah
 directly
 as
 a
 punishment
 for
 some
 extraordinary
 perversity
 or
 some
 transcendent
 act
 of
 sinfulness
 and
 that
 only
 God
 could
 heal
 it
 When
 Naaman
 was
 cured
 and
 his
 flesh
 came
 back
 like
 that
 of
 a
 little
 child
 he
 said
 Now
 I
 know
 that
 there
 is
 no
 God
 in
 all
 the
 earth
 but
 in
 Israel
 
 Kings
 
 
 The
 fact
 that
 leprosy
 is
 not
 ordinarily
 communicable
 by
 mere
 outward
 contact
 is
 accentuated
 by
 Trench
 Notes
 on
 the
 Miracles
 pp
 
 and
 the
 isolation
 of
 lepers
 required
 by
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 is
 regarded
 by
 him
 as
 an
 intended
 object
 lesson
 and
 figure
 to
 illustrate
 spiritual
 uncleanness
 He
 says
 I
 refer
 to
 the
 mistaken
 assumption
 that
 leprosy
 was
 catching
 from
 one
 person
 to
 another
 and
 that
 the
 lepers
 were
 so
 carefully
 secluded
 from
 their
 fellowmen
 lest
 they
 might
 communicate
 the
 disease
 to
 others
 as
 in
 like
 manner
 that
 the
 torn
 garment
 the
 covered
 lip
 the
 cry
 Unclean
 unclean
 Lev
 
 were
 warnings
 to
 all
 that
 they
 should
 keep
 aloof
 lest
 unawares
 touching
 a
 leper
 or
 drawing
 unto
 too
 great
 a
 nearness
 they
 should
 become
 partakers
 of
 this
 disease
 So
 far
 from
 any
 danger
 of
 the
 kind
 existing
 nearly
 all
 who
 have
 looked
 closest
 into
 the
 matter
 agree
 that
 the
 sickness
 was
 incommunicable
 by
 ordinary
 contact
 from
 one
 person
 to
 another
 A
 leper
 might
 transmit
 it
 to
 his
 children
 or
 the
 mother
 of
 a
 lepers
 children
 might
 take
 it
 from
 him
 but
 it
 was
 by
 no
 ordinary
 contact
 communicable
 from
 one
 person
 to
 another
 All
 the
 notices
 in
 the
 Old
 Testament
 as
 well
 as
 in
 other
 Jewish
 books
 confirm
 the
 statement
 that
 we
 have
 here
 something
 very
 much
 higher
 than
 a
 mere
 sanitary
 regulation
 Thus
 when
 the
 law
 of
 Moses
 was
 not
 observed
 no
 such
 exclusion
 necessarily
 found
 place
 Naaman
 the
 leper
 commanded
 the
 armies
 of
 Syria
 
 Kings
 
 Gehazi
 with
 his
 leprosy
 that
 never
 should
 be
 cleansed
 
 Kings
 
 talked
 familiarly
 with
 the
 king
 of
 apostate
 Israel
 
 Kings
 
 How
 moreover
 should
 the
 Levitical
 priests
 had
 the
 disease
 been
 this
 creeping
 infection
 have
 ever
 themselves
 escaped
 it
 obliged
 as
 they
 were
 by
 their
 very
 office
 to
 submit
 the
 leper
 to
 actual
 handling
 and
 closest
 examination
 Leprosy
 was
 nothing
 short
 of
 a
 living
 death
 a
 corrupting
 of
 all
 the
 humors
 a
 poisoning
 of
 the
 very
 springs
 of
 life
 a
 dissolution
 little
 by
 little
 of
 the
 whole
 body
 so
 that
 one
 limb
 after
 another
 actually
 decayed
 and
 fell
 away
 Aaron
 exactly
 describes
 the
 appearance
 which
 the
 leper
 presented
 to
 the
 eyes
 of
 the
 beholders
 when
 pleading
 for
 Miriam
 he
 says
 Let
 her
 not
 be
 as
 one
 dead
 of
 whom
 the
 flesh
 is
 half
 consumed
 when
 he
 cometh
 out
 of
 his
 mothers
 womb
 Numb
 
 The
 disease
 moreover
 was
 incurable
 by
 the
 art
 and
 skill
 of
 man
 not
 that
 the
 leper
 might
 not
 return
 to
 health
 for
 however
 rare
 such
 cases
 are
 contemplated
 in
 the
 Levitical
 law
 The
 leper
 thus
 fearfully
 bearing
 about
 the
 body
 the
 outward
 and
 visible
 tokens
 of
 sin
 in
 the
 soul
 was
 treated
 throughout
 as
 a
 sinner
 as
 one
 in
 whom
 sin
 had
 reached
 its
 climax
 as
 one
 dead
 in
 trespasses
 and
 sins
 He
 was
 himself
 a
 dreadful
 parable
 of
 death
 He
 bore
 about
 him
 the
 emblems
 of
 death
 Lev
 
 the
 rent
 garments
 mourning
 for
 himself
 as
 one
 dead
 the
 head
 bare
 as
 they
 were
 wont
 to
 have
 it
 who
 were
 defiled
 by
 communion
 with
 the
 dead
 Numb
 
 Ezek
 
 and
 the
 lip
 covered
 Ezek
 
 But
 the
 leper
 was
 as
 one
 dead
 and
 as
 such
 was
 shut
 out
 of
 the
 camp
 Lev
 
 Numb
 
 and
 the
 city
 
 Kings
 
 this
 law
 being
 so
 strictly
 enforced
 that
 even
 the
 sister
 of
 Moses
 might
 not
 be
 exempted
 from
 it
 Numb
 
 
 and
 kings
 themselves
 as
 Uzziah
 
 Chron
 
 
 Kings
 
 must
 submit
 to
 it
 men
 being
 by
 this
 exclusion
 taught
 that
 what
 here
 took
 place
 in
 a
 figure
 should
 take
 place
 in
 the
 reality
 with
 every
 one
 who
 was
 found
 in
 the
 death
 of
 sin

 elaborate
 ceremonies

 BlasphemyThe

 blasphemy

 Lev
 
 Smiths

 Blasphemy

 English
 sense

 the
 speaking
 evil

 in
 this
 sense
 it
 is
 found
 in
 Psalm
 
 Isa
 
 Rom
 
 etc
 On
 this
 charge
 both
 our
 Lord
 and
 Stephen
 were
 condemned
 to
 death
 by
 the
 Jews
 When
 a
 person
 heard
 blasphemy
 he
 laid
 his
 hand
 on
 the
 head
 of
 the
 offender
 to
 symbolize
 his
 sole
 responsibility
 for
 the
 guilt

 PublicanA
 word
 originally
 meaning
 a

 Romans
 who
 bought
 from
 the

 the
 right
 to
 collect
 taxes
 in
 a
 given
 territory
 These
 buyers

 senators
 were
 excluded
 by
 their

 became
 capitalists
 and
 formed
 powerful
 stock
 companies
 whose
 members
 received
 a
 percentage

 Provincial
 capitalists
 could
 not
 buy
 taxes
 which
 were
 sold
 in
 Rome
 to
 the
 highest
 bidders
 who
 to
 recoup
 themselves
 sublet
 their
 territory
 at
 a
 great
 advance
 on
 the
 price
 paid
 the
 government
 to
 the
 native
 local
 publicans
 who
 in
 their
 turn
 had
 to
 make
 a
 profit
 on
 their
 purchase
 money
 and
 being
 assessors
 of
 property
 as
 well
 as
 collectors
 of
 taxes
 had
 abundant
 opportunities
 for
 oppressing
 the
 people
 who
 hated
 them
 both
 for
 that
 reason
 and
 also
 because
 the
 tax
 itself
 was
 the
 mark
 of
 their
 subjection

 Fishers
 of
 MenFollow
 me
 and
 I
 will
 make
 you
 fishers
 of
 men
 said
 Jesus
 to
 fishermen
 who
 afterward
 became
 His
 apostles
 Matt
 
 Marks
 version
 is
 nearly
 the
 same
 
 while
 that
 of
 Luke
 
 reads
 From
 henceforth
 thou
 shalt
 catch
 men
 The
 correct
 translation
 is
 as
 commentators
 practically
 agree
 From
 henceforth
 thou
 shalt
 take
 men
 alive
 This
 reading
 emphasizes
 the
 contrast
 given
 in
 the
 textthat
 between
 capturing
 fish
 to
 kill
 them
 and
 winning
 men
 to
 save
 them
 Consider
 in
 this
 connection
 the
 Lords
 prediction
 through
 Jeremiah
 
 that
 in
 reaching
 scattered
 Israel
 Behold
 I
 will
 send
 for
 many
 fishers
 saith
 the
 Lord
 and
 they
 shall
 fish
 them

 Thy
 Sins
 Be
 Forgiven
 TheeThe
 following
 commentary
 by
 Edersheim
 Life
 and
 Times
 of
 Jesus
 the
 Messiah
 vol
 i
 pp
 
 
 on
 the
 incident
 under
 consideration
 is
 instructive
 In
 this
 forgiveness
 of
 sins
 He
 presented
 His
 person
 and
 authority
 as
 divine
 and
 He
 proved
 it
 such
 by
 the
 miracle
 of
 healing
 which
 immediately
 followed
 Had
 the
 two
 been
 inverted
 ie
 had
 Christ
 first
 healed
 the
 man
 and
 afterward
 told
 him
 that
 his
 sins
 were
 forgiven
 there
 would
 have
 been
 evidence
 indeed
 of
 His
 power
 but
 not
 of
 His
 divine
 personality
 nor
 of
 His
 having
 authority
 to
 forgive
 sins
 and
 this
 not
 the
 doing
 of
 miracles
 was
 the
 object
 of
 His
 teaching
 and
 mission
 of
 which
 the
 miracles
 were
 only
 secondary
 evidence
 Thus
 the
 inward
 reasoning
 of
 the
 scribes
 which
 was
 open
 and
 known
 to
 Him
 who
 readeth
 all
 thoughts
 issued
 in
 quite
 the
 opposite
 of
 what
 they
 could
 have
 expected
 Most
 unwarranted
 indeed
 was
 the
 feeling
 of
 contempt
 which
 we
 trace
 in
 their
 unspoken
 words
 whether
 we
 read
 them
 Why
 does
 this
 one
 thus
 speak
 blasphemies
 or
 according
 to
 a
 more
 correct
 transcript
 of
 them
 Why
 does
 this
 one
 speak
 thus
 He
 blasphemeth
 Yet
 from
 their
 point
 of
 view
 they
 were
 right
 for
 God
 alone
 can
 forgive
 sins
 nor
 has
 that
 power
 ever
 been
 given
 or
 delegated
 to
 man
 But
 was
 He
 a
 mere
 man
 like
 even
 the
 most
 honored
 of
 Gods
 servants
 Man
 indeed
 but
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 
 It
 seemed
 easy
 to
 say
 Thy
 sins
 have
 been
 forgiven
 But
 to
 Him
 who
 had
 authority
 to
 do
 so
 on
 earth
 it
 was
 neither
 more
 easy
 nor
 more
 difficult
 than
 to
 say
 Rise
 take
 up
 thy
 bed
 and
 walk
 Yet
 this
 latter
 assuredly
 proved
 the
 former
 and
 gave
 it
 in
 the
 sight
 of
 all
 men
 unquestioned
 reality
 And
 so
 it
 was
 the
 thoughts
 of
 these
 scribes
 which
 as
 applied
 to
 Christ
 were
 evilsince
 they
 imputed
 to
 Him
 blasphemythat
 gave
 occasion
 for
 offering
 real
 evidence
 of
 what
 they
 would
 have
 impugned
 and
 denied
 In
 no
 other
 manner
 could
 the
 object
 alike
 of
 miracles
 and
 of
 this
 special
 miracle
 have
 been
 so
 attained
 as
 by
 the
 evil
 thoughts
 of
 these
 scribes
 when
 miraculously
 brought
 to
 light
 they
 spoke
 out
 the
 inmost
 possible
 doubt
 and
 pointed
 to
 the
 highest
 of
 all
 questions
 concerning
 the
 Christ
 And
 so
 it
 was
 once
 more
 the
 wrath
 of
 man
 which
 praised
 Him

 CHAPTER
 
 LORD
 OF
 THE
 SABBATH
 THE
 SABBATH
 DISTINCTIVELY
 SACRED
 TO
 ISRAEL
 The
 observance
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 as
 a
 holy
 day
 was
 prominent
 among
 the
 Lords
 requirements
 of
 His
 people
 Israel
 from
 a
 very
 early
 period
 in
 their
 history
 as
 a
 nation
 Indeed
 the
 keeping
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 as
 a
 day
 of
 surcease
 from
 ordinary
 toil
 was
 a
 national
 characteristic
 by
 which
 the
 Israelites
 were
 distinguished
 from
 pagan
 peoples
 and
 rightly
 so
 for
 the
 holiness
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 was
 made
 a
 mark
 of
 the
 covenant
 between
 the
 chosen
 people
 and
 their
 God
 The
 sanctity
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 had
 been
 prefigured
 in
 the
 account
 of
 the
 creation
 antedating
 the
 placing
 of
 man
 upon
 the
 earth
 as
 shown
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 God
 rested
 after
 the
 six
 periods
 or
 days
 of
 creative
 work
 and
 blessed
 the
 seventh
 day
 and
 hallowed
 it
 In
 the
 course
 of
 Israels
 exodus
 the
 seventh
 day
 was
 set
 apart
 as
 one
 of
 rest
 upon
 which
 it
 was
 not
 allowed
 to
 bake
 seethe
 or
 otherwise
 cook
 food
 A
 double
 supply
 of
 manna
 had
 to
 be
 gathered
 on
 the
 sixth
 day
 while
 on
 other
 days
 the
 layingby
 of
 a
 surplus
 of
 this
 daily
 bread
 sent
 from
 heaven
 was
 expressly
 forbidden
 The
 Lord
 observed
 the
 sacredness
 of
 the
 holy
 day
 by
 giving
 no
 manna
 thereon
 The
 commandment
 to
 celebrate
 the
 Sabbath
 in
 strictness
 was
 made
 definite
 and
 explicit
 in
 the
 decalog
 written
 by
 the
 hand
 of
 God
 amidst
 the
 awful
 glory
 of
 Sinai
 and
 the
 injunction
 was
 kept
 before
 the
 people
 through
 frequent
 proclamation
 It
 was
 unlawful
 to
 kindle
 a
 fire
 on
 that
 day
 and
 record
 is
 made
 of
 a
 man
 who
 was
 put
 to
 death
 for
 gathering
 sticks
 on
 the
 seventh
 day
 Under
 the
 administration
 of
 later
 prophets
 the
 holiness
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 the
 blessings
 promised
 to
 those
 who
 sanctified
 the
 day
 unto
 themselves
 and
 the
 sin
 of
 Sabbath
 desecration
 were
 reiterated
 in
 words
 of
 inspired
 forcefulness
 Nehemiah
 admonished
 and
 reproved
 in
 the
 matter
 and
 attributed
 the
 affliction
 of
 the
 nation
 to
 the
 forfeiture
 of
 Jehovahs
 favor
 through
 Sabbath
 violation
 By
 the
 mouth
 of
 Ezekiel
 the
 Lord
 affirmed
 that
 the
 institution
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 was
 a
 sign
 of
 the
 covenant
 between
 Himself
 and
 the
 people
 of
 Israel
 and
 with
 stern
 severity
 He
 upbraided
 those
 who
 heeded
 not
 the
 day
 To
 the
 separate
 branch
 of
 the
 Israelitish
 nation
 that
 had
 been
 colonized
 on
 the
 western
 hemisphere
 regard
 for
 the
 sanctity
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 was
 no
 less
 an
 imperative
 requirement
 The
 observance
 demanded
 however
 was
 the
 very
 opposite
 of
 affliction
 and
 burden
 the
 Sabbath
 was
 consecrated
 to
 rest
 and
 righteous
 enjoyment
 and
 was
 to
 be
 a
 day
 of
 spiritual
 feasting
 before
 the
 Lord
 It
 was
 not
 established
 as
 a
 day
 of
 abstinence
 all
 might
 eat
 but
 both
 mistress
 and
 maid
 were
 to
 be
 relieved
 from
 the
 work
 of
 preparing
 food
 neither
 master
 nor
 man
 was
 to
 plow
 dig
 or
 otherwise
 toil
 and
 the
 Weekly
 day
 of
 rest
 was
 as
 much
 the
 boon
 of
 the
 cattle
 as
 of
 their
 owners
 In
 addition
 to
 the
 weekly
 Sabbath
 the
 Lord
 in
 mercy
 prescribed
 also
 a
 sabbatic
 year
 in
 every
 seventh
 year
 the
 land
 was
 to
 rest
 and
 thereby
 its
 fertility
 was
 enhanced
 After
 seven
 times
 seven
 years
 had
 passed
 the
 fiftieth
 was
 to
 be
 celebrated
 throughout
 as
 a
 year
 of
 jubilee
 during
 which
 the
 people
 should
 live
 on
 the
 accumulated
 increase
 of
 the
 preceding
 seasons
 of
 plenty
 and
 rejoice
 in
 liberality
 by
 granting
 to
 one
 another
 redemption
 from
 mortgage
 and
 bond
 forgiveness
 of
 debt
 and
 general
 relief
 from
 burdensall
 of
 which
 had
 to
 be
 done
 in
 mercy
 and
 justice
 The
 Sabbaths
 established
 by
 the
 Lord
 whether
 of
 days
 of
 years
 or
 of
 weeks
 of
 years
 were
 to
 be
 times
 of
 refreshing
 relief
 blessing
 bounty
 and
 worship
 To
 the
 many
 who
 profess
 to
 regard
 the
 necessity
 of
 toil
 as
 a
 part
 of
 the
 curse
 evoked
 through
 Adams
 fall
 the
 Sabbath
 should
 appeal
 as
 a
 day
 of
 temporary
 reprieve
 a
 time
 of
 exemption
 from
 labor
 and
 as
 affording
 blessed
 opportunity
 of
 closer
 approach
 to
 the
 Presence
 from
 which
 mankind
 has
 been
 shut
 out
 through
 sin
 And
 to
 those
 who
 take
 the
 higher
 view
 of
 life
 and
 find
 in
 work
 both
 happiness
 and
 material
 blessing
 the
 periodical
 relief
 brings
 refreshment
 and
 gives
 renewed
 zest
 for
 the
 days
 that
 follow
 But
 long
 before
 the
 advent
 of
 Christ
 the
 original
 purpose
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 had
 come
 to
 be
 largely
 ignored
 in
 Israel
 and
 the
 spirit
 of
 its
 observance
 had
 been
 smothered
 under
 the
 weight
 of
 rabbinical
 injunction
 and
 the
 formalism
 of
 restraint
 In
 the
 time
 of
 the
 Lords
 ministry
 the
 technicalities
 prescribed
 as
 rules
 appended
 to
 the
 law
 were
 almost
 innumerable
 and
 the
 burden
 thus
 forced
 upon
 the
 people
 had
 become
 well
 nigh
 unbearable
 Among
 the
 many
 wholesome
 requirements
 of
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 which
 the
 teachers
 and
 spiritual
 rulers
 of
 the
 Jews
 had
 made
 thus
 burdensome
 that
 of
 Sabbath
 observance
 was
 especially
 prominent
 The
 hedge
 which
 by
 unwarranted
 assumption
 they
 professedly
 set
 about
 the
 law
 was
 particularly
 thorny
 in
 the
 sections
 devoted
 to
 the
 Jewish
 Sabbath
 Even
 trifling
 infractions
 of
 traditional
 rules
 were
 severely
 punished
 and
 the
 capital
 penalty
 was
 held
 before
 the
 eyes
 of
 the
 people
 as
 a
 supreme
 threat
 for
 extreme
 desecration
 THE
 HEALING
 OF
 A
 CRIPPLE
 ON
 THE
 SABBATH
 In
 view
 of
 these
 conditions
 we
 are
 not
 surprized
 to
 find
 our
 Lord
 confronted
 with
 charges
 of
 Sabbath
 violation
 relatively
 early
 in
 the
 course
 of
 His
 public
 work
 An
 instance
 attended
 with
 many
 great
 developments
 is
 recorded
 by
 John
 whose
 narrative
 covers
 the
 incident
 of
 a
 very
 impressive
 miracle
 Jesus
 was
 again
 in
 Jerusalem
 at
 the
 time
 of
 one
 of
 the
 Jewish
 festivals
 There
 was
 a
 pool
 of
 water
 called
 Bethesda
 near
 the
 sheep
 market
 in
 the
 city
 From
 the
 recorded
 description
 we
 may
 understand
 this
 to
 have
 been
 a
 natural
 spring
 possibly
 the
 water
 was
 rich
 in
 dissolved
 solids
 or
 gases
 or
 both
 making
 it
 such
 as
 we
 would
 call
 today
 a
 mineral
 spring
 for
 we
 find
 that
 the
 water
 was
 reputed
 to
 possess
 curative
 virtues
 and
 many
 afflicted
 folk
 came
 to
 bathe
 therein
 The
 spring
 was
 of
 the
 pulsating
 variety
 at
 intervals
 its
 waters
 rose
 with
 bubbling
 disturbance
 and
 then
 receded
 to
 the
 normal
 level
 Mineral
 springs
 of
 this
 kind
 are
 known
 today
 in
 many
 parts
 of
 the
 world
 Some
 believed
 that
 the
 periodical
 upwelling
 of
 the
 Bethesda
 waters
 was
 the
 result
 of
 supernatural
 agency
 and
 it
 was
 said
 that
 whosoever
 then
 first
 after
 the
 troubling
 of
 the
 water
 stepped
 in
 was
 made
 whole
 of
 whatsoever
 disease
 he
 had
 The
 Bethesda
 pool
 was
 wholly
 or
 partly
 enclosed
 and
 five
 porches
 had
 been
 built
 for
 the
 shelter
 of
 those
 who
 waited
 at
 the
 spring
 for
 the
 intermittent
 bubbling
 up
 of
 the
 water
 On
 a
 certain
 Sabbath
 day
 Jesus
 visited
 the
 pool
 and
 saw
 many
 afflicted
 folk
 thus
 waiting
 Among
 them
 lay
 a
 man
 who
 for
 thirtyeight
 years
 had
 been
 grievously
 afflicted
 From
 the
 mans
 statement
 of
 his
 helplessness
 we
 may
 infer
 that
 his
 malady
 was
 paralysis
 or
 possibly
 an
 extreme
 form
 of
 rheumatism
 whatever
 his
 affliction
 it
 was
 so
 disabling
 as
 to
 give
 him
 little
 chance
 of
 getting
 into
 the
 pool
 at
 the
 critical
 time
 for
 others
 less
 crippled
 crowded
 him
 away
 and
 according
 to
 the
 legends
 regarding
 the
 curative
 properties
 of
 the
 spring
 only
 the
 first
 to
 enter
 the
 pool
 after
 the
 agitation
 of
 the
 water
 might
 expect
 to
 be
 healed
 Jesus
 recognized
 in
 the
 man
 a
 fit
 subject
 for
 blessing
 and
 said
 to
 him
 Wilt
 thou
 be
 made
 whole
 The
 question
 was
 so
 simple
 as
 almost
 to
 appear
 superfluous
 Of
 course
 the
 man
 wanted
 to
 be
 made
 well
 and
 on
 the
 small
 chance
 of
 being
 able
 to
 reach
 the
 water
 at
 the
 right
 moment
 was
 patiently
 yet
 eagerly
 waiting
 There
 was
 purpose
 however
 in
 these
 as
 in
 all
 other
 words
 of
 the
 Master
 The
 mans
 attention
 was
 drawn
 to
 Him
 fixed
 upon
 Him
 the
 question
 aroused
 in
 the
 sufferers
 heart
 renewed
 yearning
 for
 the
 health
 and
 strength
 of
 which
 he
 had
 been
 bereft
 since
 the
 days
 of
 his
 youth
 His
 answer
 was
 pitiful
 and
 revealed
 his
 almost
 hopeless
 state
 of
 mind
 he
 thought
 only
 of
 the
 rumored
 virtues
 of
 Bethesda
 pool
 as
 he
 said
 Sir
 I
 have
 no
 man
 when
 the
 water
 is
 troubled
 to
 put
 me
 into
 the
 pool
 but
 while
 I
 am
 coming
 another
 steppeth
 down
 before
 me
 Then
 spake
 Jesus
 Rise
 take
 up
 thy
 bed
 and
 walk
 Immediately
 strength
 returned
 to
 the
 man
 who
 for
 nearly
 four
 decades
 had
 been
 a
 helpless
 invalid
 he
 obeyed
 the
 Master
 and
 taking
 up
 the
 little
 mattress
 or
 pallet
 on
 which
 he
 had
 rested
 walked
 away
 He
 had
 not
 gone
 far
 before
 the
 Jews
 that
 is
 to
 say
 some
 of
 the
 official
 class
 for
 so
 the
 evangelist
 John
 employs
 the
 term
 saw
 him
 carrying
 his
 bed
 and
 it
 was
 the
 Sabbath
 day
 To
 their
 peremptory
 reprimand
 he
 replied
 out
 of
 the
 gratitude
 and
 honest
 simplicity
 of
 his
 heart
 that
 He
 who
 had
 healed
 him
 had
 told
 him
 to
 take
 up
 his
 bed
 and
 walk
 The
 interest
 of
 the
 inquisitors
 was
 instantly
 turned
 from
 the
 man
 toward
 Him
 who
 had
 wrought
 the
 miracle
 but
 the
 erstwhile
 cripple
 could
 not
 name
 his
 Benefactor
 as
 he
 had
 lost
 sight
 of
 Jesus
 in
 the
 crowd
 before
 he
 had
 found
 opportunity
 for
 question
 or
 thanks
 The
 man
 who
 had
 been
 healed
 went
 to
 the
 temple
 possibly
 impelled
 by
 a
 desire
 to
 express
 in
 prayer
 his
 gratitude
 and
 joy
 There
 Jesus
 found
 him
 and
 said
 unto
 him
 Behold
 thou
 art
 made
 whole
 sin
 no
 more
 lest
 a
 worse
 thing
 come
 unto
 thee
 The
 man
 had
 probably
 brought
 about
 his
 affliction
 through
 his
 own
 sinful
 habits
 The
 Lord
 decided
 that
 he
 had
 suffered
 enough
 in
 body
 and
 terminated
 his
 physical
 suffering
 with
 the
 subsequent
 admonition
 to
 sin
 no
 more
 The
 man
 went
 and
 told
 the
 rulers
 who
 it
 was
 that
 had
 healed
 him
 This
 he
 may
 have
 done
 with
 a
 desire
 to
 honor
 and
 glorify
 the
 Giver
 of
 his
 boon
 we
 are
 not
 justified
 in
 ascribing
 to
 him
 any
 unworthy
 purpose
 though
 by
 his
 act
 he
 was
 instrumental
 in
 augmenting
 the
 persecution
 of
 his
 Lord
 So
 intense
 was
 the
 hatred
 of
 the
 priestly
 faction
 that
 the
 rulers
 sought
 a
 means
 of
 putting
 Jesus
 to
 death
 under
 the
 specious
 pretense
 of
 His
 being
 a
 Sabbathbreaker
 We
 may
 well
 ask
 of
 what
 act
 they
 could
 possibly
 have
 hoped
 to
 convict
 Him
 even
 under
 the
 strictest
 application
 of
 their
 rules
 There
 was
 no
 proscription
 against
 speaking
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 and
 Jesus
 had
 but
 spoken
 to
 heal
 He
 had
 not
 carried
 the
 mans
 bed
 nor
 had
 He
 attempted
 even
 the
 lightest
 physical
 labor
 By
 their
 own
 interpretation
 of
 the
 law
 they
 had
 no
 case
 against
 Him
 OUR
 LORDS
 REPLY
 TO
 THE
 ACCUSING
 JEWS
 Nevertheless
 the
 Jewish
 officials
 confronted
 Jesus
 with
 accusations
 Whether
 the
 interview
 took
 place
 within
 the
 temple
 walls
 on
 the
 open
 street
 at
 the
 market
 place
 or
 in
 the
 judgment
 hall
 matters
 not
 His
 reply
 to
 their
 charges
 is
 not
 confined
 to
 the
 question
 of
 Sabbath
 observance
 it
 stands
 as
 the
 most
 comprehensive
 sermon
 in
 scripture
 on
 the
 vital
 subject
 of
 the
 relationship
 between
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 and
 His
 Son
 Jesus
 Christ
 His
 first
 sentence
 added
 to
 the
 already
 intense
 anger
 of
 the
 Jews
 Referring
 to
 the
 work
 He
 had
 done
 on
 the
 holy
 day
 He
 said
 My
 Father
 worketh
 hitherto
 and
 I
 work
 This
 remark
 they
 construed
 to
 be
 a
 blasphemy
 Therefore
 the
 Jews
 sought
 the
 more
 to
 kill
 him
 because
 he
 not
 only
 had
 broken
 the
 Sabbath
 but
 said
 also
 that
 God
 was
 his
 Father
 making
 himself
 equal
 with
 God
 To
 their
 spoken
 or
 unuttered
 protest
 Jesus
 replied
 that
 He
 the
 Son
 was
 not
 acting
 independently
 and
 in
 fact
 could
 do
 nothing
 except
 what
 was
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 Fathers
 will
 and
 what
 He
 had
 seen
 the
 Father
 do
 that
 the
 Father
 so
 loved
 the
 Son
 as
 to
 show
 unto
 Him
 the
 Fathers
 works
 Be
 it
 observed
 that
 Jesus
 in
 no
 way
 attempted
 to
 explain
 away
 their
 construction
 of
 His
 words
 on
 the
 contrary
 He
 confirmed
 their
 deductions
 as
 correct
 He
 did
 associate
 Himself
 with
 the
 Father
 even
 in
 a
 closer
 and
 more
 exalted
 relationship
 than
 they
 had
 conceived
 The
 authority
 given
 to
 Him
 by
 the
 Father
 was
 not
 limited
 to
 the
 healing
 of
 bodily
 infirmities
 He
 had
 power
 even
 to
 raise
 the
 deadFor
 as
 the
 Father
 raiseth
 up
 the
 dead
 and
 quickeneth
 them
 even
 so
 the
 Son
 quickeneth
 whom
 he
 will
 Moreover
 the
 judgment
 of
 men
 had
 been
 committed
 unto
 Him
 and
 no
 one
 could
 honor
 the
 Father
 except
 by
 honoring
 the
 Son
 Then
 followed
 this
 incisive
 declaration
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 He
 that
 heareth
 my
 word
 and
 believeth
 on
 him
 that
 sent
 me
 hath
 everlasting
 life
 and
 shall
 not
 come
 into
 condemnation
 but
 is
 passed
 from
 death
 unto
 life
 Christs
 realm
 was
 not
 bounded
 by
 the
 grave
 even
 the
 dead
 were
 wholly
 dependent
 upon
 Him
 for
 their
 salvation
 and
 to
 the
 terrified
 ears
 of
 His
 dumbfounded
 accusers
 He
 proclaimed
 the
 solemn
 truth
 that
 even
 then
 the
 hour
 was
 near
 in
 which
 the
 dead
 should
 hear
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 Ponder
 His
 profound
 affirmation
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 The
 hour
 is
 coming
 and
 now
 is
 when
 the
 dead
 shall
 hear
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 and
 they
 that
 hear
 shall
 live
 The
 murderous
 rage
 of
 the
 Jews
 was
 rebuffed
 by
 the
 declaration
 that
 without
 His
 submission
 they
 could
 not
 take
 His
 life
 For
 as
 the
 Father
 hath
 life
 in
 himself
 so
 hath
 he
 given
 to
 the
 Son
 to
 have
 life
 in
 himself
 Another
 utterance
 was
 equally
 portentous
 And
 hath
 given
 him
 authority
 to
 execute
 judgment
 also
 because
 he
 is
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 He
 the
 Son
 of
 the
 exalted
 and
 glorified
 Man
 of
 Holiness
 and
 now
 Himself
 a
 mortal
 Man
 was
 to
 be
 the
 judge
 of
 men
 No
 wonder
 they
 marveled
 such
 doctrine
 they
 had
 never
 before
 heard
 nor
 read
 it
 was
 not
 of
 the
 scribes
 nor
 of
 the
 rabbis
 of
 neither
 the
 Pharisaic
 nor
 Sadducean
 schools
 But
 He
 reproved
 their
 amazement
 saying
 Marvel
 not
 at
 this
 for
 the
 hour
 is
 coming
 in
 the
 which
 all
 that
 are
 in
 the
 graves
 shall
 hear
 his
 voice
 And
 shall
 come
 forth
 they
 that
 have
 done
 good
 unto
 the
 resurrection
 of
 life
 and
 they
 that
 have
 done
 evil
 unto
 the
 resurrection
 of
 damnation
 This
 enunciation
 of
 the
 resurrection
 so
 plainly
 made
 that
 the
 most
 unlettered
 could
 understand
 must
 have
 offended
 any
 Sadducees
 present
 for
 they
 emphatically
 denied
 the
 actuality
 of
 the
 resurrection
 The
 universality
 of
 a
 resurrection
 is
 here
 unquestionably
 affirmed
 not
 only
 the
 righteous
 but
 even
 those
 who
 merit
 condemnation
 are
 to
 come
 forth
 from
 their
 graves
 in
 their
 bodies
 of
 flesh
 and
 bones
 Then
 renewing
 His
 solemn
 asseveration
 of
 the
 unity
 of
 His
 Fathers
 will
 and
 His
 own
 Christ
 discussed
 the
 matter
 of
 witnesses
 to
 His
 work
 He
 admitted
 what
 was
 a
 recognized
 tenet
 of
 the
 time
 that
 no
 mans
 unsupported
 witness
 of
 himself
 was
 sufficient
 but
 He
 added
 There
 is
 another
 that
 beareth
 witness
 of
 me
 and
 I
 know
 that
 the
 witness
 which
 he
 witnesseth
 of
 me
 is
 true
 He
 cites
 John
 the
 Baptist
 and
 reminds
 them
 that
 they
 had
 sent
 a
 delegation
 to
 him
 and
 that
 John
 had
 answered
 them
 by
 bearing
 testimony
 of
 the
 Messiah
 and
 John
 had
 been
 a
 burning
 and
 a
 shining
 light
 in
 whose
 illuminating
 ministry
 many
 had
 temporarily
 rejoiced
 The
 hostile
 Jews
 were
 left
 to
 see
 that
 the
 witness
 of
 John
 was
 valid
 under
 their
 strictest
 construction
 of
 the
 rules
 of
 evidence
 But
 He
 continued
 I
 receive
 not
 testimony
 from
 man
 
 But
 I
 have
 greater
 witness
 than
 that
 of
 John
 for
 the
 works
 which
 the
 Father
 hath
 given
 me
 to
 finish
 the
 same
 works
 that
 I
 do
 bear
 witness
 of
 me
 that
 the
 Father
 hath
 sent
 me
 And
 the
 Father
 himself
 which
 hath
 sent
 me
 hath
 borne
 witness
 of
 me
 Then
 in
 terms
 of
 unqualified
 condemnation
 He
 told
 them
 they
 were
 devoid
 of
 the
 Fathers
 word
 for
 they
 refused
 to
 accept
 Himself
 whom
 the
 Father
 had
 sent
 With
 humiliating
 directness
 He
 admonished
 these
 learned
 men
 of
 the
 law
 these
 interpreters
 of
 the
 prophets
 these
 professional
 expounders
 of
 sacred
 writ
 to
 betake
 themselves
 to
 reading
 and
 study
 Search
 the
 scriptures
 said
 He
 for
 in
 them
 ye
 think
 ye
 have
 eternal
 life
 and
 they
 are
 they
 which
 testify
 of
 me
 Convictingly
 He
 continuedthat
 they
 who
 admitted
 and
 taught
 that
 in
 the
 scriptures
 lay
 the
 way
 to
 eternal
 life
 refused
 to
 come
 to
 Him
 of
 whom
 those
 same
 scriptures
 testified
 though
 by
 coming
 they
 might
 obtain
 eternal
 life
 I
 receive
 not
 honour
 from
 men
 He
 added
 But
 I
 know
 you
 that
 ye
 have
 not
 the
 love
 of
 God
 in
 you
 They
 knew
 that
 they
 sought
 for
 honor
 among
 men
 received
 honors
 from
 one
 another
 were
 made
 rabbis
 and
 doctors
 scribes
 and
 teachers
 by
 the
 bestowal
 of
 titles
 and
 degreesall
 of
 men
 but
 they
 rejected
 Him
 who
 came
 in
 the
 name
 of
 One
 infinitely
 greater
 than
 all
 their
 schools
 or
 societiesHe
 had
 come
 in
 the
 supreme
 name
 of
 the
 Father
 The
 cause
 of
 their
 spiritual
 ignorance
 was
 pointed
 outthey
 relied
 upon
 the
 honors
 of
 men
 and
 sought
 not
 the
 honor
 of
 real
 service
 in
 the
 cause
 of
 God
 He
 had
 spoken
 of
 the
 authority
 of
 judgment
 that
 had
 been
 committed
 to
 Himself
 now
 He
 explained
 that
 they
 should
 not
 think
 He
 would
 accuse
 them
 before
 the
 Father
 a
 lesser
 one
 than
 He
 would
 accuse
 even
 Moses
 another
 of
 His
 witnesses
 in
 whom
 they
 professed
 such
 trustMoses
 whom
 they
 all
 were
 said
 to
 believeand
 driving
 home
 the
 full
 effect
 of
 His
 powerful
 arraignment
 the
 Lord
 continued
 For
 had
 ye
 believed
 Moses
 ye
 would
 have
 believed
 me
 for
 he
 wrote
 of
 me
 But
 if
 ye
 believe
 not
 his
 writings
 how
 shall
 ye
 believe
 my
 words
 Such
 was
 the
 illuminating
 instruction
 combined
 with
 burning
 denunciation
 that
 these
 men
 had
 called
 forth
 by
 their
 futile
 attempt
 to
 convict
 Jesus
 on
 the
 charge
 of
 Sabbath
 desecration
 This
 was
 but
 one
 of
 many
 evil
 machinations
 by
 which
 they
 so
 determinedly
 plotted
 and
 strove
 to
 attach
 the
 stigma
 and
 invoke
 the
 penalty
 of
 Sabbathbreaking
 upon
 the
 very
 One
 who
 had
 ordained
 the
 Sabbath
 and
 was
 in
 truth
 and
 verity
 the
 one
 and
 only
 Lord
 thereof
 THE
 DISCIPLES
 CHARGED
 WITH
 SABBATHBREAKING
 We
 may
 profitably
 consider
 in
 this
 connection
 other
 instances
 of
 good
 work
 done
 by
 our
 Lord
 on
 Sabbath
 days
 and
 this
 we
 may
 do
 without
 undue
 regard
 to
 the
 order
 of
 the
 events
 in
 time
 We
 again
 find
 Jesus
 in
 Galilee
 whether
 prior
 to
 or
 after
 His
 visit
 to
 Jerusalem
 at
 the
 time
 of
 the
 unidentified
 feast
 on
 which
 occasion
 He
 wrought
 the
 miracle
 of
 healing
 at
 the
 Bethesda
 pool
 matters
 not
 On
 a
 certain
 Sabbath
 He
 and
 the
 disciples
 walked
 through
 a
 field
 of
 grain
 and
 being
 hungry
 the
 disciples
 began
 to
 pluck
 some
 of
 the
 ripening
 ears
 rubbing
 out
 the
 kernels
 between
 their
 hands
 they
 ate
 There
 was
 no
 element
 of
 theft
 in
 what
 they
 did
 for
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 provided
 that
 in
 passing
 through
 anothers
 vineyard
 or
 corn
 field
 one
 might
 pluck
 grapes
 or
 corn
 to
 relieve
 hunger
 but
 it
 was
 forbidden
 to
 use
 a
 sickle
 in
 the
 field
 or
 to
 carry
 away
 any
 of
 the
 grapes
 in
 a
 vessel
 The
 permission
 extended
 only
 to
 the
 relief
 of
 present
 need
 When
 the
 disciples
 of
 Jesus
 availed
 themselves
 of
 this
 lawful
 privilege
 there
 were
 Pharisees
 on
 the
 watch
 and
 these
 came
 at
 once
 to
 the
 Master
 saying
 Behold
 thy
 disciples
 do
 that
 which
 is
 not
 lawful
 to
 do
 upon
 the
 sabbath
 day
 The
 accusers
 doubtless
 had
 in
 mind
 the
 rabbinical
 dictum
 that
 rubbing
 out
 an
 ear
 of
 grain
 in
 the
 hands
 was
 a
 species
 of
 threshing
 that
 blowing
 away
 the
 chaff
 was
 winnowing
 and
 that
 it
 was
 unlawful
 to
 thresh
 or
 winnow
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 Indeed
 some
 learned
 rabbis
 had
 held
 it
 to
 be
 a
 sin
 to
 walk
 on
 grass
 during
 the
 Sabbath
 inasmuch
 as
 the
 grass
 might
 be
 in
 seed
 and
 the
 treading
 out
 of
 the
 seed
 would
 be
 as
 the
 threshing
 of
 grain
 Jesus
 defended
 the
 disciples
 by
 citing
 a
 precedent
 applicable
 to
 the
 case
 and
 of
 much
 greater
 import
 The
 instance
 was
 that
 of
 David
 who
 with
 a
 small
 company
 of
 men
 had
 asked
 bread
 of
 the
 priest
 Ahimelech
 for
 they
 were
 hungry
 and
 in
 haste
 The
 priest
 had
 none
 but
 consecrated
 bread
 the
 loaves
 of
 shewbread
 which
 were
 placed
 in
 the
 sanctuary
 at
 intervals
 and
 which
 none
 but
 the
 priests
 were
 allowed
 to
 eat
 In
 view
 of
 the
 condition
 of
 urgent
 need
 the
 priest
 had
 given
 the
 shewbread
 to
 the
 hungry
 men
 Jesus
 also
 reminded
 the
 critical
 Pharisees
 that
 the
 priests
 in
 the
 temple
 regularly
 did
 much
 work
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 in
 the
 slaughtering
 of
 sacrificial
 victims
 and
 in
 altar
 service
 generally
 yet
 were
 held
 blameless
 because
 of
 the
 higher
 requirements
 of
 worship
 which
 rendered
 such
 labor
 necessary
 and
 added
 with
 solemn
 emphasis
 But
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 in
 this
 place
 is
 one
 greater
 than
 the
 temple
 He
 cited
 the
 word
 of
 God
 spoken
 through
 Hosea
 I
 will
 have
 mercy
 and
 not
 sacrifice
 and
 reproved
 at
 once
 their
 ignorance
 and
 their
 unrighteous
 zeal
 by
 telling
 them
 that
 had
 they
 known
 what
 that
 scripture
 meant
 they
 would
 not
 have
 condemned
 the
 guiltless
 Be
 it
 remembered
 The
 sabbath
 was
 made
 for
 man
 and
 not
 man
 for
 the
 sabbath
 His
 reproof
 was
 followed
 by
 the
 affirmation
 of
 His
 personal
 supremacy
 For
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 is
 Lord
 even
 of
 the
 sabbath
 day
 What
 can
 we
 gather
 from
 that
 declaration
 but
 that
 He
 Jesus
 there
 present
 in
 the
 flesh
 was
 the
 Being
 through
 whom
 the
 Sabbath
 had
 been
 ordained
 that
 it
 was
 He
 who
 had
 given
 and
 written
 in
 stone
 the
 decalog
 including
 Remember
 the
 sabbath
 day
 to
 keep
 it
 holy
 and
 the
 seventh
 day
 is
 the
 sabbath
 of
 the
 Lord
 thy
 God
 A
 PHARISAICAL
 PLOT
 Again
 on
 a
 Sabbath
 Jesus
 went
 into
 a
 synagog
 and
 saw
 in
 the
 congregation
 a
 man
 whose
 right
 hand
 was
 withered
 There
 were
 Pharisees
 present
 and
 they
 watched
 to
 see
 whether
 Jesus
 would
 heal
 the
 man
 their
 purpose
 being
 to
 accuse
 Him
 if
 He
 did
 so
 The
 Pharisees
 asked
 Is
 it
 lawful
 to
 heal
 on
 the
 sabbath
 days
 Our
 Lord
 countered
 their
 poorly
 veiled
 purpose
 by
 asking
 Is
 it
 lawful
 to
 do
 good
 on
 the
 sabbath
 days
 and
 extended
 the
 question
 or
 to
 do
 evil
 to
 save
 life
 or
 to
 kill
 They
 held
 their
 peace
 for
 the
 question
 was
 doubleedged
 To
 reply
 in
 the
 affirmative
 would
 have
 been
 to
 justify
 the
 work
 of
 healing
 a
 negative
 answer
 would
 have
 stultified
 them
 He
 put
 another
 question
 What
 man
 shall
 there
 be
 among
 you
 that
 shall
 have
 one
 sheep
 and
 if
 it
 fall
 into
 a
 pit
 on
 the
 sabbath
 day
 will
 he
 not
 lay
 hold
 on
 it
 and
 lift
 it
 out
 How
 much
 then
 is
 a
 man
 better
 than
 a
 sheep
 As
 the
 Pharisees
 could
 not
 or
 would
 not
 reply
 He
 summed
 up
 the
 whole
 matter
 thus
 Wherefore
 it
 is
 lawful
 to
 do
 well
 on
 the
 sabbath
 days
 He
 called
 upon
 the
 man
 with
 the
 withered
 hand
 to
 stand
 forth
 before
 the
 congregation
 Grief
 and
 anger
 were
 mingled
 in
 His
 penetrating
 and
 sweeping
 glance
 but
 turning
 with
 compassion
 toward
 the
 afflicted
 one
 He
 commanded
 him
 to
 stretch
 forth
 his
 hand
 the
 man
 obeyed
 and
 lo
 the
 hand
 was
 restored
 whole
 like
 as
 the
 other
 The
 discomfited
 Pharisees
 were
 furious
 filled
 with
 madness
 Luke
 says
 and
 they
 went
 out
 to
 plot
 anew
 against
 the
 Lord
 So
 bitter
 was
 their
 hatred
 that
 they
 allied
 themselves
 with
 the
 Herodians
 a
 political
 party
 generally
 unpopular
 among
 the
 Jews
 The
 rulers
 of
 the
 people
 were
 ready
 to
 enter
 into
 any
 intrigue
 or
 alliance
 to
 accomplish
 their
 avowed
 purpose
 of
 bringing
 about
 the
 death
 of
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 Aware
 of
 the
 wicked
 determination
 against
 Him
 Jesus
 withdrew
 Himself
 from
 the
 locality
 Other
 accusations
 of
 Sabbathbreaking
 brought
 against
 Christ
 by
 Jewish
 casuists
 will
 be
 considered
 later

 CHAPTER
 
 
 Rabbinical
 Requirements
 Concerning
 Sabbath
 ObservanceNo
 feature
 of
 the
 Jewish
 system
 was
 so
 marked
 as
 their
 extraordinary
 strictness
 in
 the
 outward
 observance
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 as
 a
 day
 of
 entire
 rest
 The
 Scribes
 had
 elaborated
 from
 the
 command
 of
 Moses
 a
 vast
 array
 of
 prohibitions
 and
 injunctions
 covering
 the
 whole
 of
 social
 individual
 and
 public
 life
 and
 carried
 it
 to
 the
 extreme
 of
 ridiculous
 caricature
 Lengthened
 rules
 were
 prescribed
 as
 to
 the
 kinds
 of
 knots
 which
 might
 legally
 be
 tied
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 The
 cameldrivers
 knot
 and
 the
 sailors
 were
 unlawful
 and
 it
 was
 equally
 illegal
 to
 tie
 or
 to
 loose
 them
 A
 knot
 which
 could
 be
 untied
 with
 one
 hand
 might
 be
 undone
 A
 shoe
 or
 sandal
 a
 womans
 cup
 a
 wine
 or
 oilskin
 or
 a
 fleshpot
 might
 be
 tied
 A
 pitcher
 at
 a
 spring
 might
 be
 tied
 to
 the
 bodysash
 but
 not
 with
 a
 cord
 To
 kindle
 or
 extinguish
 a
 fire
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 was
 a
 great
 desecration
 of
 the
 day
 nor
 was
 even
 sickness
 allowed
 to
 violate
 Rabbinical
 rules
 It
 was
 forbidden
 to
 give
 an
 emetic
 on
 the
 Sabbathto
 set
 a
 broken
 bone
 or
 put
 back
 a
 dislocated
 joint
 though
 some
 Rabbis
 more
 liberal
 held
 that
 whatever
 endangered
 life
 made
 the
 Sabbath
 law
 void
 for
 the
 commands
 were
 given
 to
 Israel
 only
 that
 they
 might
 live
 by
 them
 One
 who
 was
 buried
 under
 ruins
 on

 might
 be

 The
 Unnamed
 FeastThere
 has
 been
 no
 little
 discussion
 as
 to
 the
 particular
 festival
 referred
 to
 in
 John
 
 at
 the
 time
 of
 which
 Jesus
 healed
 the
 cripple
 at
 the
 pool
 of
 Bethesda
 Many
 writers
 hold
 that
 it
 was
 the
 Passover
 others
 that
 it
 was
 the
 feast
 of
 Purim
 or
 some
 other
 Jewish
 celebration
 The
 only
 semblance
 of
 importance
 attaching
 to
 the
 question
 is
 the
 possibility
 of
 learning
 from
 the
 fact
 if
 it
 could
 be
 proved
 something
 of
 the
 chronological
 order
 of
 events
 at
 this
 period
 of
 our
 Lords
 life
 We
 are
 not
 told
 which
 feast
 this
 was
 neither
 the
 year
 nor
 the
 time
 of
 the
 year
 when
 it
 occurred
 The
 miracle
 wrought
 on
 the
 occasion
 and
 the
 doctrinal
 discourse
 delivered
 as
 a
 result
 thereof
 depend
 for
 their
 value
 in
 no
 degree
 on
 the
 determination
 of
 date
 
 ShewbreadThe
 name
 means
 bread
 of
 the
 presence
 signifying
 that
 it
 was
 placed
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 Jehovah
 The
 bread
 so
 sanctified
 consisted
 of
 twelve
 loaves
 made
 without
 leaven
 They
 were
 to
 be
 deposited
 in
 the
 Holy
 Place
 in
 two
 columns
 of
 six
 loaves
 each
 Zenos
 in
 Stand
 Bible
 Dict
 writes
 They
 were
 allowed
 to
 remain
 there
 for
 a
 whole
 week
 at
 the
 end
 of
 which
 period
 they
 were
 removed
 and
 eaten
 by
 the
 priest
 upon
 holy
 ground
 ie
 within
 the
 precincts
 of
 the
 sanctuary
 For
 other
 persons
 than
 priests
 to
 eat
 of
 the
 loaves
 of
 the
 shewbread
 was
 regarded
 as
 sacrilegious
 for
 they
 were
 holy
 See
 Exo
 
 Lev
 
 
 Sam
 
 
 The
 Sabbath
 Was
 Made
 for
 Man
 and
 Not
 Man
 for
 the
 SabbathEdersheim
 vol
 i
 pp
 
 
 says
 When
 on
 his
 flight
 from
 Saul
 David
 had
 when
 an
 hungered
 eaten
 of
 the
 shewbread
 and
 given
 it
 to
 his
 followers
 although
 by
 the
 letter
 of
 the
 Levitical
 law
 it
 was
 only
 to
 be
 eaten
 by
 the
 priests
 Jewish
 tradition
 vindicated
 his
 conduct
 on
 the
 plea
 that
 danger
 to
 life
 superseded
 the
 Sabbath
 law
 and
 hence
 all
 laws
 connected
 with
 it
 In
 truth
 the
 reason
 why
 David
 was
 blameless
 in
 eating
 the
 shewbread
 was
 the
 same
 as
 that
 which
 made
 the
 Sabbath
 labor
 of
 the
 priests
 lawful
 The
 Sabbath
 law
 was
 not
 one
 merely
 of
 rest
 but
 of
 rest
 for
 worship
 The
 service
 of
 the
 Lord
 was
 the
 object
 in
 view
 The
 priests
 worked
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 because
 this
 service
 was
 the
 object
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 and
 David
 was
 allowed
 to
 eat
 of
 the
 shewbread
 not
 solely
 because
 there
 was
 danger
 to
 life
 from
 starvation
 but
 because
 he
 pleaded
 that
 he
 was
 on
 the
 service
 of
 the
 Lord
 and
 needed
 this
 provision
 The
 disciples
 when
 following
 the
 Lord
 were
 similarly
 on
 the
 service
 of
 the
 Lord
 ministering
 to
 Him
 was
 more
 than
 ministering
 in
 the
 temple
 for
 He
 was
 greater
 than
 the
 temple
 If
 the
 Pharisees
 had
 believed
 this
 they
 would
 not
 have
 questioned
 their
 conduct
 nor
 in
 so
 doing
 have
 themselves
 infringed
 that
 higher
 law
 which
 enjoined
 mercy
 not
 sacrifice

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 CHOSEN
 TWELVE
 THEIR
 CALL
 AND
 ORDINATION
 The
 night
 preceding
 the
 morn
 on
 which
 the
 Twelve
 Apostles
 were
 called
 and
 ordained
 was
 spent
 by
 the
 Lord
 in
 solitary
 seclusion
 He
 had
 continued
 all
 night
 in
 prayer
 to
 God
 Then
 when
 day
 had
 come
 and
 while
 many
 people
 were
 gathering
 to
 hear
 more
 of
 the
 new
 and
 wonderful
 gospel
 of
 the
 kingdom
 He
 called
 to
 come
 closer
 some
 who
 had
 theretofore
 been
 devotedly
 associated
 together
 as
 His
 disciples
 or
 followers
 and
 from
 among
 them
 He
 chose
 twelve
 whom
 he
 ordained
 and
 named
 apostles
 Prior
 to
 that
 time
 none
 of
 these
 had
 been
 distinguished
 by
 any
 special
 delegation
 of
 authority
 or
 appointment
 they
 had
 been
 numbered
 with
 the
 disciples
 in
 general
 though
 as
 we
 have
 seen
 seven
 had
 received
 a
 preliminary
 call
 and
 had
 promptly
 responded
 thereto
 by
 abandoning
 wholly
 or
 in
 part
 their
 business
 affairs
 and
 had
 followed
 the
 Master
 These
 were
 Andrew
 John
 Simon
 Peter
 Philip
 Nathanael
 James
 and
 Levi
 Matthew
 Prior
 to
 this
 eventful
 day
 however
 none
 of
 the
 Twelve
 had
 been
 ordained
 or
 set
 apart
 to
 their
 sacred
 office
 The
 three
 Gospelwriters
 who
 make
 record
 of
 the
 organization
 of
 the
 Twelve
 place
 Simon
 Peter
 first
 and
 Judas
 Iscariot
 last
 in
 the
 category
 they
 agree
 also
 in
 the
 relative
 position
 of
 some
 but
 not
 of
 all
 the
 others
 Following
 the
 order
 given
 by
 Mark
 and
 this
 may
 be
 the
 most
 convenient
 since

 TWELVE
 CONSIDERED
 INDIVIDUALLY
 Simon
 named
 as
 the
 first
 apostle
 is
 more
 commonly
 known
 as
 Peterthe
 appellation
 given
 him
 by
 the
 Lord
 on
 the
 occasion
 of
 their
 first
 meeting
 and
 afterward
 confirmed
 He
 was
 the
 son
 of
 Jona
 or
 Jonas
 and
 by
 vocation
 was
 a
 fisherman
 He
 and
 his
 brother
 Andrew
 were
 partners
 with
 James
 and
 John
 the
 sons
 of
 Zebedee
 and
 apparently
 the
 fishing
 business
 was
 a
 prosperous
 one
 with
 them
 for
 they
 owned
 their
 boats
 and
 gave
 employment
 to
 other
 men
 Peters
 early
 home
 had
 been
 at
 the
 little
 fishery
 town
 of
 Bethsaida
 on
 the
 west
 shore
 of
 the
 Sea
 of
 Galilee
 but
 about
 the
 time
 of
 his
 first
 association
 with
 Jesus
 or
 soon
 thereafter
 he
 with
 others
 of
 his
 family
 removed
 to
 Capernaum
 where
 he
 appears
 to
 have
 become
 an
 independent
 householder
 Simon
 Peter
 was
 a
 married
 man
 before
 his
 call
 to
 the
 ministry
 He
 was
 well
 to
 do
 in
 a
 material
 way
 and
 when
 he
 once
 spoke
 of
 having
 left
 all
 to
 follow
 Jesus
 the
 Lord
 did
 not
 deny
 that
 Peters
 sacrifice
 of
 temporal
 possessions
 was
 as
 great
 as
 had
 been
 implied
 We
 are
 not
 justified
 in
 regarding
 him
 as
 unlettered
 or
 ignorant
 True
 both
 he
 and
 John
 were
 designated
 by
 the
 council
 of
 rulers
 as
 unlearned
 and
 ignorant
 men
 but
 this
 was
 spoken
 of
 them
 as
 indicating
 their
 lack
 of
 training
 in
 the
 schools
 of
 the
 rabbis
 and
 it
 is
 worthy
 of
 note
 that
 the
 members
 of
 that
 same
 council
 were
 amazed
 at
 the
 wisdom
 and
 power
 manifested
 by
 the
 two
 apostles
 whom
 they
 professed
 to
 despize
 In
 temperament
 Peter
 was
 impulsive
 and
 stern
 and
 until
 trained
 by
 severe
 experience
 was
 lacking
 in
 firmness
 He
 had
 many
 human
 weaknesses
 yet
 in
 spite
 of
 them
 all
 he
 eventually
 overcame
 the
 temptations
 of
 Satan
 and
 the
 frailties
 of
 the
 flesh
 and
 served
 his
 Lord
 as
 the
 appointed
 and
 acknowledged
 leader
 of
 the
 Twelve
 Of
 the
 time
 and
 place
 of
 his
 death
 the
 scriptures
 do
 not
 speak
 but
 the
 manner
 thereof
 was
 prefigured
 by
 the
 resurrected
 Lord
 and
 in
 part
 was
 foreseen
 by
 Peter
 himself
 Tradition
 originating
 in
 the
 writings
 of
 the
 early
 Christian
 historians
 other
 than
 the
 apostles
 states
 that
 Peter
 met
 death
 by
 crucifixion
 as
 a
 martyr
 during
 the
 persecution
 incident
 to
 the
 reign
 of
 Nero
 probably
 between
 AD
 
 and
 
 Origen
 states
 that
 the
 apostle
 was
 crucified
 with
 his
 head
 downward
 Peter
 with
 James
 and
 John
 his
 associates
 in
 the
 presidency
 of
 the
 Twelve
 has
 ministered
 as
 a
 resurrected
 being
 in
 the
 present
 dispensation
 in
 restoring
 to
 earth
 the
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 including
 the
 Holy
 Apostleship
 which
 had
 been
 taken
 away
 because
 of
 the
 apostasy
 and
 unbelief
 of
 men
 James
 and
 John
 brothers
 by
 birth
 partners
 in
 business
 as
 fishermen
 brethren
 in
 the
 ministry
 were
 associated
 together
 and
 with
 Peter
 in
 the
 apostolic
 calling
 The
 Lord
 bestowed
 upon
 the
 pair
 a
 title
 in
 commonBoanerges
 or
 Sons
 of
 Thunderpossibly
 with
 reference
 to
 the
 zeal
 they
 developed
 in
 His
 service
 which
 indeed
 at
 times
 had
 to
 be
 restrained
 as
 when
 they
 would
 have
 had
 fire
 called
 from
 heaven
 to
 destroy
 the
 Samaritan
 villagers
 who
 had
 refused
 hospitality
 to
 the
 Master
 They
 and
 their
 mother
 aspired
 to
 the
 highest
 honors
 of
 the
 kingdom
 and
 asked
 that
 the
 two
 be
 given
 places
 one
 on
 the
 right
 the
 other
 on
 the
 left
 of
 Christ
 in
 His
 glory
 This
 ambition
 was
 gently
 reproved
 by
 the
 Lord
 and
 the
 request
 gave
 offense
 to
 the
 other
 apostles
 With
 Peter
 these
 two
 brothers
 were
 witnesses
 of
 many
 of
 the
 most
 important
 incidents
 in
 the
 life
 of
 Jesus
 thus
 the
 three
 were
 the
 only
 apostles
 admitted
 to
 witness
 the
 raising
 of
 the
 daughter
 of
 Jairus
 from
 death
 to
 life
 they
 were
 the
 only
 members
 of
 the
 Twelve
 present
 at
 the
 transfiguration
 of
 Christ
 they
 were
 nearest
 the
 Lord
 during
 the
 period
 of
 His
 mortal
 agony
 in
 Gethsemane
 and
 as
 heretofore
 told
 they
 have
 ministered
 in
 these
 modern
 days
 in
 the
 restoration
 of
 the
 Holy
 Apostleship
 with
 all
 its
 ancient
 authority
 and
 power
 of
 blessing
 James
 is
 commonly
 designated
 in
 theological
 literature
 as
 James
 I
 to
 distinguish
 him
 from
 the
 other
 apostle
 bearing
 the
 same
 name
 James
 the
 son
 of
 Zebedee
 was
 the
 first
 of
 the
 apostles
 to
 meet
 a
 martyrs
 violent
 death
 he
 was
 beheaded
 by
 order
 of
 the
 king
 Herod
 Agrippa
 John
 had
 been
 a
 disciple
 of
 the
 Baptist
 and
 had
 demonstrated
 his
 confidence
 in
 the
 latters
 testimony
 of
 Jesus
 by
 promptly
 turning
 from
 the
 forerunner
 and
 following
 the
 Lord
 He
 became
 a
 devoted
 servant
 and
 repeatedly
 refers
 to
 himself
 as
 the
 disciple
 whom
 Jesus
 loved
 At
 the
 last
 supper
 John
 sat
 next
 to
 Jesus
 leaning
 his
 head
 upon
 the
 Masters
 breast
 and
 next
 day
 as
 he
 stood
 beneath
 the
 cross
 he
 received
 from
 the
 dying
 Christ
 the
 special
 charge
 to
 care
 for
 the
 Lords
 mother
 and
 to
 this
 he
 promptly
 responded
 by
 conducting
 the
 weeping
 Mary
 to
 his
 own
 house
 He
 was
 the
 first
 to
 recognize
 the
 risen
 Lord
 on
 the
 shores
 of
 Galilee
 and
 received
 from
 His
 immortal
 lips
 encouragement
 of
 his
 hope
 that
 his
 life
 would
 be
 continued
 in
 the
 body
 in
 order
 that
 he
 might
 minister
 among
 men
 until
 the
 Christ
 shall
 come
 in
 His
 glory
 The
 realization
 of
 that
 hope
 has
 been
 attested
 by
 revelation
 in
 modern
 days
 Andrew
 son
 of
 Jona
 and
 brother
 of
 Simon
 Peter
 is
 mentioned
 less
 frequently
 than
 the
 three
 already
 considered
 He
 had
 been
 one
 of
 the
 Baptists
 followers
 and
 with
 John
 the
 son
 of
 Zebedee
 left
 the
 Baptist
 to
 learn
 from
 Jesus
 and
 having
 learned
 he
 went
 in
 search
 of
 Peter
 solemnly
 averred
 to
 him
 that
 the
 Messiah
 had
 been
 found
 and
 brought
 his
 brother
 to
 the
 Saviors
 feet
 He
 shared
 with
 Peter
 in
 the
 honor
 of
 the
 call
 of
 the
 Lord
 on
 the
 sea
 shore
 and
 in
 the
 promise
 I
 will
 make
 you
 fishers
 of
 men
 In
 one
 instance
 we
 read
 of
 Andrew
 as
 present
 with
 Peter
 James
 and
 John
 in
 a
 private
 interview
 with
 the
 Lord
 and
 he
 is
 mentioned
 in
 connection
 with
 the
 miraculous
 feeding
 of
 the
 five
 thousand
 and
 as
 associated
 with
 Philip
 in
 arranging
 an
 interview
 between
 certain
 inquiring
 Greeks
 and
 Jesus
 He
 is
 named
 with
 others
 in
 connection
 with
 our
 Lords
 ascension
 Tradition
 is
 rife
 with
 stories
 about
 this
 man
 but
 of
 the
 extent
 of
 his
 ministry
 the
 duration
 of
 his
 life
 and
 the
 circumstances
 of
 his
 death
 we
 have
 no
 authentic
 record
 Philip
 may
 have
 been
 the
 first
 to
 receive
 the
 authoritative
 call
 Follow
 me
 from
 the
 lips
 of
 Jesus
 and
 we
 find
 him
 immediately
 testifying
 that
 Jesus
 was
 the
 long
 expected
 Messiah
 His
 home
 was
 in
 Bethsaida
 the
 town
 of
 Peter
 Andrew
 James
 and
 John
 It
 is
 said
 that
 Jesus
 found
 him
 whereas
 the
 others
 concerned
 in
 that
 early
 affiliation
 seem
 to
 have
 come
 of
 themselves
 severally
 to
 Christ
 We
 find
 brief
 mention
 of
 him
 at
 the
 time
 the
 five
 thousand
 were
 fed
 on
 which
 occasion
 Jesus
 asked
 him
 Whence
 shall
 we
 buy
 bread
 that
 these
 may
 eat
 This
 was
 done
 to
 test
 and
 prove
 him
 for
 Jesus
 knew
 what
 would
 be
 done
 Philips
 reply
 was
 based
 on
 a
 statement
 of
 the
 small
 amount
 of
 money
 at
 hand
 and
 showed
 no
 expectation
 of
 miraculous
 intervention
 It
 was
 to
 him
 the
 Greeks
 applied
 when
 they
 sought
 a
 meeting
 with
 Jesus
 as
 noted
 in
 connection
 with
 Andrew
 He
 was
 mildly
 reproved
 for
 his
 misunderstanding
 when
 he
 asked
 Jesus
 to
 show
 to
 him
 and
 the
 others
 the
 FatherHave
 I
 been
 so
 long
 time
 with
 you
 and
 yet
 hast
 thou
 not
 known
 me
 Philip
 Aside
 from
 incidental
 mention
 of
 his
 presence
 as
 one
 of
 the
 Eleven
 after
 the
 ascension
 the
 scriptures
 tell
 us
 nothing
 more
 concerning
 him
 Bartholomew
 is
 mentioned
 in
 scripture
 by
 this
 name
 only
 in
 connection
 with
 his
 ordination
 to
 the
 apostleship
 and
 as
 one
 of
 the
 Eleven
 after
 the
 ascension
 The
 name
 means
 son
 of
 Tolmai
 It
 is
 practically
 certain
 however
 that
 he
 is
 the
 man
 called
 Nathanael
 in
 Johns
 Gospelthe
 one
 whom
 Christ
 designated
 as
 an
 Israelite
 indeed
 in
 whom
 is
 no
 guile
 He
 is
 named
 again
 as
 among
 those
 who
 went
 fishing
 with
 Peter
 after
 the
 resurrection
 of
 Christ
 His
 home
 was
 in
 Cana
 of
 Galilee
 The
 reasons
 for
 assuming
 that
 Bartholomew
 and
 Nathanael
 are
 the
 same
 persons
 are
 these
 Bartholomew
 is
 named
 in
 each
 of
 the
 three
 synoptic
 Gospels
 as
 an
 apostle
 but
 Nathanael
 is
 not
 mentioned
 Nathanael
 is
 named
 twice
 in
 Johns
 Gospel
 and
 Bartholomew
 not
 at
 all
 Bartholomew
 and
 Philip
 or
 Nathanael
 and
 Philip
 are
 mentioned
 together
 Matthew
 or
 Levi
 son
 of
 Alpheus
 was
 one
 of
 the
 seven
 who
 received
 a
 call
 to
 follow
 Christ
 before
 the
 ordination
 of
 the
 Twelve
 He
 it
 was
 who
 gave
 a
 feast
 for
 attending
 which
 Jesus
 and
 the
 disciples
 were
 severely
 criticized
 by
 the
 Pharisees
 on
 the
 charge
 that
 it
 was
 unseemly
 for
 Him
 to
 eat
 with
 publicans
 and
 sinners
 Matthew
 was
 a
 publican
 he
 so
 designates
 himself
 in
 the
 Gospel
 he
 wrote
 but
 the
 other
 evangelists
 omit
 the
 mention
 when
 including
 him
 with
 the
 Twelve
 His
 Hebrew
 name
 Levi
 is
 understood
 by
 many
 as
 an
 indication
 of
 priestly
 lineage
 Of
 his
 ministry
 we
 have
 no
 detailed
 account
 though
 he
 is
 the
 author
 of
 the
 first
 Gospel
 he
 refrains
 from
 special
 mention
 of
 himself
 except
 in
 connection
 with
 his
 call
 and
 ordination
 He
 is
 spoken
 of
 by
 other
 than
 scriptural
 writers
 as
 one
 of
 the
 most
 active
 of
 the
 apostles
 after
 Christs
 death
 and
 as
 operating
 in
 lands
 far
 from
 Palestine
 Thomas
 also
 known
 as
 Didymus
 the
 Greek
 equivalent
 of
 his
 Hebrew
 name
 meaning
 a
 twin
 is
 mentioned
 as
 a
 witness
 of
 the
 raising
 of
 Lazarus
 His
 devotion
 to
 Jesus
 is
 shown
 by
 his
 desire
 to
 accompany
 the
 Lord
 to
 Bethany
 though
 persecution
 in
 that
 region
 was
 almost
 certain
 To
 his
 fellow
 apostles
 Thomas
 said
 Let
 us
 also
 go
 that
 we
 may
 die
 with
 him
 Even
 as
 late
 in
 his
 experience
 as
 the
 night
 before
 the
 crucifixion
 Thomas
 had
 failed
 to
 comprehend
 the
 impending
 necessity
 of
 the
 Saviors
 sacrifice
 and
 when
 Jesus
 referred
 to
 going
 away
 and
 leaving
 the
 others
 to
 follow
 Thomas
 asked
 how
 they
 could
 know
 the
 way
 For
 his
 lack
 of
 understanding
 he
 stood
 reproved
 He
 was
 absent
 when
 the
 resurrected
 Christ
 appeared
 to
 the
 assembled
 disciples
 in
 the
 evening
 of
 the
 day
 of
 His
 rising
 and
 on
 being
 informed
 by
 the
 others
 that
 they
 had
 seen
 the
 Lord
 he
 forcefully
 expressed
 his
 doubt
 and
 declared
 he
 would
 not
 believe
 unless
 he
 could
 see
 and
 feel
 for
 himself
 the
 wounds
 in
 the
 crucified
 body
 Eight
 days
 later
 the
 Lord
 visited
 the
 apostles
 again
 when
 as
 on
 the
 earlier
 occasion
 they
 were
 within
 closed
 doors
 and
 to
 Thomas
 the
 Lord
 said
 Reach
 hither
 thy
 finger
 and
 behold
 my
 hands
 and
 reach
 hither
 thy
 hand
 and
 thrust
 it
 into
 my
 side
 Then
 Thomas
 no
 longer
 doubting
 but
 with
 love
 and
 reverence
 filling
 his
 soul
 exclaimed
 My
 Lord
 and
 my
 God
 The
 Lord
 said
 unto
 him
 Thomas
 because
 thou
 hast
 seen
 me
 thou
 hast
 believed
 blessed
 are
 they
 that
 have
 not
 seen
 and
 yet
 have
 believed
 Of
 Thomas
 no
 further
 record
 appears
 in
 the
 New
 Testament
 aside
 from
 that
 of
 his
 presence
 with
 his
 fellows
 after
 the
 ascension
 James
 son
 of
 Alpheus
 is
 mentioned
 in
 the
 Gospels
 only
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 his
 ordination
 to
 the
 apostleship
 and
 but
 once
 elsewhere
 in
 the
 New
 Testament
 by
 the
 appellation
 son
 of
 Alpheus
 In
 writings
 other
 than
 scriptural
 he
 is
 sometimes
 designated
 as
 James
 II
 to
 avoid
 confusing
 him
 with
 James
 the
 son
 of
 Zebedee
 There
 is
 acknowledged
 uncertainty
 concerning
 the
 identity
 of
 James
 the
 son
 of
 Alpheus
 as
 the
 James
 or
 one
 of
 the
 Jamess
 referred
 to
 in
 the
 Acts
 and
 the
 Epistles
 and
 a
 plenitude
 of
 controversial
 literature
 on
 the
 subject
 is
 extant
 Judas
 is
 called
 Lebbeus
 Thaddeus
 by
 Matthew
 Thaddeus
 by
 Mark
 and
 Judas
 the
 brother
 of
 James
 by
 Luke
 The
 only
 other
 specific
 reference
 to
 this
 apostle
 is
 made
 by
 John
 and
 is
 incident
 to
 the
 last
 long
 interview
 between
 Jesus
 and
 the
 apostles
 when
 this
 Judas
 not
 Iscariot
 asked
 how
 or
 why
 Jesus
 would
 manifest
 Himself
 to
 His
 chosen
 servants
 and
 not
 to
 the
 world
 at
 large
 The
 mans
 question
 shows
 that
 the
 really
 distinguishing
 character
 of
 the
 apostleship
 was
 not
 fully
 comprehended
 by
 him
 at
 that
 time
 Simon
 Zelotes
 so
 designated
 in
 Acts
 and
 as
 Simon
 called
 Zelotes
 in
 Lukes
 Gospel
 is
 distinguished
 by
 both
 Matthew
 and
 Mark
 as
 the
 Canaanite
 The
 last
 designation
 has
 no
 reference
 to
 the
 town
 of
 Cana
 nor
 to
 the
 land
 of
 Canaan
 neither
 is
 it
 in
 any
 sense
 of
 geographical
 signification
 it
 is
 the
 SyroChaldaic
 equivalent
 of
 the
 Greek
 word
 which
 is
 rendered
 in
 the
 English
 translation
 Zelotes
 The
 two
 names
 therefore
 have
 the
 same
 fundamental
 meaning
 and
 each
 refers
 to
 the
 Zealots
 a
 Jewish
 sect
 or
 faction
 known
 for
 its
 zeal
 in
 maintaining
 the
 Mosaic
 ritual
 Doubtless
 Simon
 had
 learned
 moderation
 and
 toleration
 from
 the
 teachings
 of
 Christ
 otherwise
 he
 would
 scarcely
 have
 been
 suited
 to
 the
 apostolic
 ministry
 His
 zealous
 earnestness
 properly
 directed
 may
 have
 developed
 into
 a
 most
 serviceable
 trait
 of
 character
 This
 apostle
 is
 nowhere
 in
 the
 scriptures
 named
 apart
 from
 his
 colleagues
 Judas
 Iscariot
 is
 the
 only
 Judean
 named
 among
 the
 Twelve
 all
 the
 others
 were
 Galileans
 He
 is
 generally
 understood
 to
 have
 been
 a
 resident
 of
 Kerioth
 a
 small
 town
 in
 the
 southerly
 part
 of
 Judea
 but
 a
 few
 miles
 west
 from
 the
 Dead
 Sea
 though
 for
 this
 tradition
 as
 also
 for
 the
 signification
 of
 his
 surname
 we
 lack
 direct
 authority
 So
 too
 we
 are
 uninformed
 as
 to
 his
 lineage
 except
 that
 his
 fathers
 name
 was
 Simon
 He
 served
 as
 treasurer
 or
 agent
 of
 the
 apostolic
 company
 receiving
 and
 disbursing
 such
 offerings
 as
 were
 made
 by
 disciples
 and
 friends
 and
 purchasing
 supplies
 as
 required
 That
 he
 was
 unprincipled
 and
 dishonest
 in
 the
 discharge
 of
 this
 trust
 is
 attested
 by
 John
 His
 avaricious
 and
 complaining
 nature
 revealed
 itself
 in
 his
 murmuring
 against
 what
 he
 called
 a
 waste
 of
 costly
 spikenard
 in
 the
 anointing
 of
 the
 Lord
 by
 Mary
 but
 a
 few
 days
 before
 the
 crucifixion
 he
 hypocritically
 suggested
 that
 the
 precious
 ointment
 could
 have
 been
 sold
 and
 the
 proceeds
 given
 to
 the
 poor
 The
 crowning
 deed
 of
 perfidy
 in
 the
 career
 of
 Iscariot
 was
 his
 deliberate
 betrayal
 of
 his
 Master
 to
 death
 and
 this
 the
 infamous
 creature
 did
 for
 a
 price
 and
 accomplished
 the
 foul
 deed
 with
 a
 kiss
 He
 brought
 his
 guilty
 life
 to
 a
 close
 by
 a
 revolting
 suicide
 and
 his
 spirit
 went
 to
 the
 awful
 fate
 reserved
 for
 the
 sons
 of
 perdition
 GENERAL
 CHARACTERISTICS
 OF
 THE
 TWELVE
 A
 survey
 of
 the
 general
 characteristics
 and
 qualifications
 of
 this
 body
 of
 twelve
 men
 reveals
 some
 interesting
 facts
 Before
 their
 selection
 as
 apostles
 they
 had
 all
 become
 close
 disciples
 of
 the
 Lord
 they
 believed
 in
 Him
 several
 of
 them
 possibly
 all
 had
 openly
 confessed
 that
 He
 was
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 and
 yet
 it
 is
 doubtful
 that
 any
 one
 of
 them
 fully
 understood
 the
 real
 significance
 of
 the
 Saviors
 work
 It
 is
 evident
 by
 the
 later
 remarks
 of
 many
 of
 them
 and
 by
 the
 instructions
 and
 rebuke
 they
 called
 forth
 from
 the
 Master
 that
 the
 common
 Jewish
 expectation
 of
 a
 Messiah
 who
 would
 reign
 in
 splendor
 as
 an
 earthly
 sovereign
 after
 He
 had
 subdued
 all
 other
 nations
 had
 a
 place
 even
 in
 the
 hearts
 of
 these
 chosen
 ones
 After
 long
 experience
 Peters
 concern
 was
 Behold
 we
 have
 forsaken
 all
 and
 followed
 thee
 what
 shall
 we
 have
 therefore
 They
 were
 as
 children
 to
 be
 trained
 and
 taught
 but
 they
 were
 mostly
 willing
 pupils
 receptive
 of
 soul
 and
 imbued
 with
 a
 sincere
 eagerness
 to
 serve
 To
 Jesus
 they
 were
 His
 little
 ones
 His
 children
 His
 servants
 and
 His
 friends
 as
 they
 merited
 They
 were
 all
 of
 the
 common
 people
 not
 rabbis
 scholars
 nor
 priestly
 officials
 Their
 inner
 natures
 not
 their
 outward
 accomplishments
 were
 taken
 into
 prime
 account
 in
 the
 Lords
 choosing
 The
 Master
 chose
 them
 they
 did
 not
 choose
 themselves
 by
 Him
 they
 were
 ordained
 and
 they
 could
 in
 consequence
 rely
 the
 more
 implicitly
 upon
 His
 guidance
 and
 support
 To
 them
 much
 was
 given
 much
 of
 them
 was
 required
 With
 the
 one
 black
 exception
 they
 all
 became
 shining
 lights
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God

 vindicated

 DISCIPLES
 AND
 APOSTLES
 Discipleship
 is
 general
 any
 follower
 of
 a
 man
 or
 devotee
 to
 a
 principle
 may
 be
 called
 a
 disciple
 The
 Holy
 Apostleship
 is
 an
 office
 and
 calling
 belonging
 to
 the
 Higher
 or
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 at
 once
 exalted
 and
 specific
 comprizing
 as
 a
 distinguishing
 function
 that
 of
 personal
 and
 special
 witness
 to
 the
 divinity
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 as
 the
 one
 and
 only
 Redeemer
 and
 Savior
 of
 mankind
 The
 apostleship
 is
 an
 individual
 bestowal
 and
 as
 such
 is
 conferred
 only
 through
 ordination
 That
 the
 Twelve
 did
 constitute
 a
 council
 or
 quorum
 having
 authority
 in
 the
 Church
 established
 by
 Jesus
 Christ
 is
 shown
 by
 their
 ministrations
 after
 the
 Lords
 resurrection
 and
 ascension
 Their
 first
 official
 act
 was
 that
 of
 filling
 the
 vacancy
 in
 their
 organization
 occasioned
 by
 the
 apostasy
 and
 death
 of
 Judas
 Iscariot
 and
 in
 connection
 with
 this
 procedure
 the
 presiding
 apostle
 Peter
 set
 forth
 the
 essential
 qualifications
 of
 the
 one
 who
 would
 be
 chosen
 and
 ordained
 which
 comprized
 such
 knowledge
 of
 Jesus
 His
 life
 death
 and
 resurrection
 as
 would
 make
 the
 new
 apostle
 one
 with
 the
 Eleven
 as
 special
 witnesses
 of
 the
 Lords
 work
 The
 ordination
 of
 the
 Twelve
 Apostles
 marked
 the
 inauguration
 of
 an
 advanced
 epoch
 in
 the
 earthly
 ministry
 of
 Jesus
 an
 epoch
 characterized
 by
 the
 organization
 of
 a
 body
 of
 men
 invested
 with
 the
 authority
 of
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 upon
 whom
 would
 rest
 more
 particularly
 after
 the
 Lords
 departure
 the
 duty
 and
 responsibility
 of
 continuing
 the
 work
 He
 had
 begun
 and
 of
 building
 up
 the
 Church
 established
 by
 Him
 The
 word
 apostle
 is
 an
 Anglicized
 form
 derived
 from
 the
 Greek
 apostolos
 meaning
 literally
 one
 who
 is
 sent
 and
 connoting
 an
 envoy
 or
 official
 messenger
 who
 speaks
 and
 acts
 by
 the
 authority
 of
 one
 superior
 to
 himself
 In
 this
 sense
 Paul
 afterward
 applied
 the
 title
 to
 Christ
 as
 one
 specially
 sent
 and
 commissioned
 of
 the
 Father
 The
 Lords
 purpose
 in
 choosing
 and
 ordaining
 the
 Twelve
 is
 thus
 enunciated
 by
 Mark
 And
 he
 ordained
 twelve
 that
 they
 should
 be
 with
 him
 and
 that
 he
 might
 send
 them
 forth
 to
 preach
 and
 to
 have
 power
 to
 heal
 sicknesses
 and
 to
 cast
 out
 devils
 For
 a
 season
 following
 their
 ordination
 the
 apostles
 remained
 with
 Jesus
 being
 specially
 trained
 and
 instructed
 by
 Him
 for
 the
 work
 then
 before
 them
 afterward
 they
 were
 specifically
 charged
 and
 sent
 forth
 to
 preach
 and
 to
 administer
 in
 the
 authority
 of
 their
 priesthood
 as
 shall
 be
 hereafter
 considered

 We
 are
 uninformed
 as
 to
 which
 James
 is
 referred
 to
 and
 as
 to
 whether
 the

 here
 mentioned
 was
 the

 The
 Meaning
 of
 ApostleThe
 title
 Apostle
 is
 likewise
 one
 of
 special
 significance
 and
 sanctity
 it
 has
 been
 given
 of
 God
 and
 belongs
 only
 to
 those
 who
 have
 been
 called
 and
 ordained
 as
 special
 witnesses
 of
 the
 name
 of
 Christ
 in
 all
 the
 world
 thus
 differing
 from
 other
 officers
 in
 the
 Church
 in
 the
 duties
 of
 their
 calling
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 By
 derivation
 the
 word
 apostle
 is
 the
 English
 equivalent
 of
 the
 Greek
 apostolos
 indicating
 a
 messenger
 an
 ambassador
 or
 literally
 one
 who
 is
 sent
 It
 signifies
 that
 he
 who
 is
 rightly
 so
 called
 speaks
 and
 acts
 not
 of
 himself
 but
 as
 the
 representative
 of
 a
 higher
 power
 whence
 his
 commission
 issued
 and
 in
 this
 sense
 the
 title
 is
 that
 of
 a
 servant
 rather
 than
 that
 of
 a
 superior
 Even
 the
 Christ
 however
 is
 called
 an
 Apostle
 with
 reference
 to
 His
 ministry
 in
 the
 flesh
 Hebrews
 
 and
 this
 appellation
 is
 justified
 by
 His
 repeated
 declaration
 that
 He
 came
 to
 earth
 to
 do
 not
 His
 own
 will
 but
 that
 of
 the
 Father
 by
 whom
 He
 was
 sent
 Though
 an
 apostle
 is
 thus
 seen
 to
 be
 essentially
 an
 envoy
 or
 ambassador
 his
 authority
 is
 great
 as
 is
 also
 the
 responsibility
 associated
 therewith
 for
 he
 speaks
 in
 the
 name
 of
 a
 power
 greater
 than
 his
 ownthe
 name
 of
 Him
 whose
 special
 witness
 he
 is
 When
 one
 of
 the
 Twelve
 is
 sent
 to
 minister
 in
 any
 stake
 mission
 or
 other
 division
 of
 the
 Church
 or
 to
 labor
 in
 regions
 where
 no
 Church
 organization
 has
 been
 effected
 he
 acts
 as
 the
 representative
 of
 the
 First
 Presidency
 and
 has
 the
 right
 to
 use
 his
 authority
 in
 doing
 whatever
 is
 requisite
 for
 the
 furtherance
 of
 the
 work
 of
 God
 His
 duty
 is
 to
 preach
 the
 Gospel
 administer
 the
 ordinances
 thereof
 and
 set
 in
 order
 the
 affairs
 of
 the
 Church
 wherever
 he
 is
 sent
 So
 great
 is
 the
 sanctity
 of
 this
 special
 calling
 that
 the
 title
 Apostle
 should
 not
 be
 used
 lightly
 as
 the
 common
 or
 ordinary
 form
 of
 address
 applied
 to
 living
 men
 called
 to
 this
 office
 The
 quorum
 or
 council
 of
 the
 Twelve
 Apostles
 as
 existent
 in
 the
 Church
 today
 may
 better
 be
 spoken
 of
 as
 the
 Quorum
 of
 the
 Twelve
 the
 Council
 of
 the
 Twelve
 or
 simply
 as
 the
 Twelve
 than
 as
 the
 Twelve
 Apostles
 except
 as
 particular
 occasion
 may
 warrant
 the
 use
 of
 the
 more
 sacred
 term
 It
 is
 advized
 that
 the
 title
 Apostle
 be
 not
 applied
 as
 a
 prefix
 to
 the
 name
 of
 any
 member
 of
 the
 Council
 of
 the
 Twelve
 but
 that
 such
 a
 one
 be
 addressed
 or
 spoken
 of
 as
 Brother
 
 or
 Elder
 
 and
 when
 necessary
 or
 desirable
 as
 in
 announcing
 his
 presence
 in
 a
 public
 assembly
 an
 explanatory
 clause
 may
 be
 added

 has

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 SERMON
 ON
 THE
 MOUNT
 At
 some
 time
 very
 near
 that
 of
 the
 ordination
 of
 the
 Twelve
 Jesus
 delivered
 a
 remarkable
 discourse
 which
 in
 reference
 to
 the
 place
 where
 it
 was
 given
 has
 come
 to
 be
 known
 as
 the
 Sermon
 on
 the
 Mount
 Matthew
 presents
 an
 extended
 account
 occupying
 three
 chapters
 of
 the
 first
 Gospel
 Luke
 gives
 a
 briefer
 synopsis
 Circumstantial
 variations
 appearing
 in
 the
 two
 records
 are
 of
 minor
 importance
 it
 is
 the
 sermon
 itself
 to
 which
 we
 may
 profitably
 devote
 attention
 Luke
 introduces
 in
 different
 parts
 of
 his
 writings
 many
 of
 the
 precious
 precepts
 given
 as
 parts
 of
 the
 sermon
 recorded
 as
 a
 continuous
 discourse
 in
 the
 Gospel
 written
 by
 Matthew
 In
 our
 present
 study
 we
 shall
 be
 guided
 principally
 by
 Matthews
 account
 Some
 portions
 of
 this
 comprehensive
 address
 were
 expressly
 directed
 to
 the
 disciples
 who
 had
 been
 or
 would
 be
 called
 to
 the
 apostleship
 and
 in
 consequence
 be
 required
 to
 renounce
 all
 their
 worldly
 interests
 for
 the
 labors
 of
 the
 ministry
 other
 parts
 were
 and
 are
 of
 general
 application
 Jesus
 had
 ascended
 the
 mountain
 side
 probably
 to
 escape
 the
 crowds
 that
 thronged
 Him
 in
 or
 near
 the
 towns
 The
 disciples
 gathered
 about
 Him
 and
 there
 He
 sat
 and
 taught
 them
 THE
 BEATITUDES
 The
 opening
 sentences
 are
 rich
 in
 blessing
 and
 the
 first
 section
 of
 the
 discourse
 is
 devoted
 to
 an
 explanation
 of
 what
 constitutes
 genuine
 blessedness
 the
 lesson
 moreover
 was
 made
 simple
 and
 unambiguous
 by
 specific
 application
 each
 of
 the
 blessed
 being
 assured
 of
 recompense
 and
 reward
 in
 the
 enjoyment
 of
 conditions
 directly
 opposite
 to
 those
 under
 which
 he
 had
 suffered
 The
 blessings
 particularized
 by
 the
 Lord
 on
 this
 occasion
 have
 been
 designated
 in
 literature
 of
 later
 time
 as
 the
 Beatitudes
 The
 poor
 in
 spirit
 are
 to
 be
 made
 rich
 as
 rightful
 heirs
 to
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 the
 mourner
 shall
 be
 comforted
 for
 he
 shall
 see
 the
 divine
 purpose
 in
 his
 grief
 and
 shall
 again
 associate
 with
 the
 beloved
 ones
 of
 whom
 he
 has
 been
 bereft
 the
 meek
 who
 suffer
 spoliation
 rather
 than
 jeopardize
 their
 souls
 in
 contention
 shall
 inherit
 the
 earth
 those
 that
 hunger
 and
 thirst
 for
 the
 truth
 shall
 be
 fed
 in
 rich
 abundance
 they
 that
 show
 mercy
 shall
 be
 judged
 mercifully
 the
 pure
 in
 heart
 shall
 be
 admitted
 to
 the
 very
 presence
 of
 God
 the
 peacemakers
 who
 try
 to
 save
 themselves
 and
 their
 fellows
 from
 strife
 shall
 be
 numbered
 among
 the
 children
 of
 God
 they
 that
 suffer
 persecution
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 righteousness
 shall
 inherit
 the
 riches
 of
 the
 eternal
 kingdom
 To
 the
 disciples
 the
 Lord
 spake
 directly
 saying
 Blessed
 are
 ye
 when
 men
 shall
 revile
 you
 and
 persecute
 you
 and
 shall
 say
 all
 manner
 of
 evil
 against
 you
 falsely
 for
 my
 sake
 Rejoice
 and
 be
 exceeding
 glad
 for
 great
 is
 your
 reward
 in
 heaven
 for
 so
 persecuted
 they
 the
 prophets
 which
 were
 before
 you
 It
 is
 evident
 that
 the
 specified
 blessings
 and
 the
 happiness
 comprized
 therein
 are
 to
 be
 realized
 in
 their
 fulness
 only
 beyond
 the
 grave
 though
 the
 joy
 that
 comes
 from
 the
 consciousness
 of
 right
 living
 brings
 even
 in
 this
 world
 a
 rich
 return
 An
 important
 element
 in
 this
 splendid
 elucidation
 of
 the
 truly
 blessed
 state
 is
 the
 implied
 distinction
 between
 pleasure
 and
 happiness
 Mere
 pleasure
 is
 at
 best
 but
 fleeting
 happiness
 is
 abiding
 for
 in
 the
 recollection
 thereof
 is
 joy
 renewed
 Supreme
 happiness
 is
 not
 an
 earthly
 attainment
 the
 promised
 fulness
 of
 joy
 lies
 beyond
 death
 and
 the
 resurrection
 While
 man
 exists
 in
 this
 mortal
 state
 he
 needs
 some
 of
 the
 things
 of
 the
 world
 he
 must
 have
 food
 and
 clothing
 and
 provision
 for
 shelter
 and
 beside
 these
 bare
 necessities
 he
 may
 righteously
 desire
 the
 facilities
 of
 education
 the
 incidentals
 of
 advancing
 civilization
 and
 the
 things
 that
 are
 conducive
 to
 refinement
 and
 culture
 yet
 all
 of
 these
 are
 but
 aids
 to
 achievement
 not
 the
 end
 to
 attain
 which
 man
 was
 made
 mortal
 The
 Beatitudes
 are
 directed
 to
 the
 duties
 of
 mortal
 life
 as
 a
 preparation
 for
 a
 greater
 existence
 yet
 future
 In
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 twice
 named
 in
 this
 part
 of
 the
 Lords
 discourse
 are
 true
 riches
 and
 unfailing
 happiness
 to
 be
 found
 The
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 was
 the
 allcomprizing
 text
 of
 this
 wonderful
 sermon
 the
 means
 of
 reaching
 the
 kingdom
 and
 the
 glories
 of
 eternal
 citizenship
 therein
 are
 the
 main
 divisions
 of
 the
 treatise
 DIGNITY
 AND
 RESPONSIBILITY
 IN
 THE
 MINISTRY
 The
 Master
 next
 proceeded
 to
 instruct
 with
 particular
 directness
 those
 upon
 whom
 would
 devolve
 the
 responsibility
 of
 the
 ministry
 as
 His
 commissioned
 representatives
 Ye
 are
 the
 salt
 of
 the
 earth
 said
 He
 Salt
 is
 the
 great
 preservative
 as
 such
 it
 has
 had
 practical
 use
 since
 very
 ancient
 times
 Salt
 was
 prescribed
 as
 an
 essential
 addition
 to
 every
 meat
 offering
 under
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 Long
 before
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 the
 use
 of
 salt
 had
 been
 accorded
 a
 symbolism
 of
 fidelity
 hospitality
 and
 covenant
 To
 be
 of
 use
 salt
 must
 be
 pure
 to
 be
 of
 any
 saving
 virtue
 as
 salt
 it
 must
 be
 salt
 indeed
 and
 not
 the
 product
 of
 chemical
 alteration
 or
 of
 earthy
 admixture
 whereby
 its
 saltiness
 or
 savor
 would
 be
 lost
 and
 as
 worthless
 stuff
 it
 would
 be
 fit
 only
 to
 be
 thrown
 away
 Against
 such
 change
 of
 faith
 against
 such
 admixture
 with
 the
 sophistries
 socalled
 philosophies
 and
 heresies
 of
 the
 times
 the
 disciples
 were
 especially
 warned
 Then
 changing
 the
 figure
 Jesus
 likened
 them
 to
 the
 light
 of
 the
 world
 and
 enjoined
 upon
 them
 the
 duty
 of
 keeping
 their
 light
 before
 the
 people
 as
 prominently
 as
 stands
 a
 city
 built
 upon
 a
 hill
 to
 be
 seen
 from
 all
 directions
 a
 city
 that
 cannot
 be
 hid
 Of
 what
 service
 would
 a
 lighted
 candle
 be
 if
 hidden
 under
 a
 tub
 or
 a
 box
 Let
 your
 light
 so
 shine
 before
 men
 said
 He
 that
 they
 may
 see
 your
 good
 works
 and
 glorify
 your
 Father
 which
 is
 in
 heaven
 That
 they
 should
 make
 no
 error
 as
 to
 the
 relationship
 of
 the
 ancient
 law
 and
 the
 gospel
 of
 the
 kingdom
 which
 He
 was
 elucidating
 Jesus
 assured
 them
 that
 He
 had
 not
 come
 to
 destroy
 the
 law
 nor
 to
 nullify
 the
 teachings
 and
 predictions
 of
 the
 prophets
 but
 to
 fulfil
 such
 and
 to
 establish
 that
 for
 which
 the
 developments
 of
 the
 centuries
 gone
 had
 been
 but
 preparatory
 The
 gospel
 may
 be
 said
 to
 have
 destroyed
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 only
 as
 the
 seed
 is
 destroyed
 in
 the
 growth
 of
 the
 new
 plant
 only
 as
 the
 bud
 is
 destroyed
 by
 the
 bursting
 forth
 of
 the
 rich
 full
 and
 fragrant
 flowers
 only
 as
 infancy
 and
 youth
 pass
 forever
 as
 the
 maturity
 of
 years
 develops
 Not
 a
 jot
 or
 a
 tittle
 of
 the
 law
 was
 to
 be
 void
 A
 more
 effective
 analogy
 than
 the
 last
 could
 scarcely
 have
 been
 conceived
 the
 jot
 or
 yod
 and
 the
 tittle
 were
 small
 literary
 marks
 in
 the
 Hebrew
 script
 for
 present
 purposes
 we
 may
 regard
 them
 as
 equivalent
 to
 the
 dot
 of
 an
 i
 or
 the
 cross
 of
 a
 t
 with
 the
 first
 the
 jot
 our
 English
 word
 iota
 signifying
 a
 trifle
 is
 related
 Not
 even
 the
 least
 commandment
 could
 be
 violated
 without
 penalty
 but
 the
 disciples
 were
 admonished
 to
 take
 heed
 that
 their
 keeping
 of
 the
 commandments
 was
 not
 after
 the
 manner
 of
 the
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 whose
 observance
 was
 that
 of
 ceremonial
 externalism
 lacking
 the
 essentials
 of
 genuine
 devotion
 for
 they
 were
 assured
 that
 by
 such
 an
 insincere
 course
 they
 could
 in
 no
 case
 enter
 into
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 THE
 LAW
 SUPERSEDED
 BY
 THE
 GOSPEL
 The
 next
 section
 of
 the
 sermon
 deals
 with
 the
 superiority
 of
 the
 gospel
 of
 Christ
 over
 the
 law
 of
 Moses
 and
 contrasts
 the
 requirements
 of
 the
 two
 in
 particular
 instances
 Whereas
 the
 law
 forbade
 murder
 and
 provided
 a
 just
 penalty
 for
 the
 crime
 Christ
 taught
 that
 ones
 giving
 way
 to
 anger
 which
 might
 possibly
 lead
 to
 violence
 or
 even
 murder
 was
 of
 itself
 a
 sin
 To
 maliciously
 use
 an
 offensive
 epithet
 such
 as
 Raca
 laid
 one
 liable
 to
 punishment
 under
 the
 decree
 of
 the
 council
 and
 to
 call
 another
 a
 fool
 placed
 one
 in
 danger
 of
 hell
 fire
 These
 objectionable
 designations
 were
 regarded
 at
 that
 time
 as
 especially
 opprobrious
 and
 were
 therefore
 expressive
 of
 hateful
 intent
 The
 murderers
 hand
 is
 impelled
 by
 the
 hatred
 in
 his
 heart
 The
 law
 provided
 penalty
 for
 the
 deed
 the
 gospel
 rebuked
 the
 evil
 passion
 in
 its
 incipiency
 To
 emphasize
 this
 principle
 the
 Master
 showed
 that
 hatred
 was
 not
 to
 be
 atoned
 by
 a
 material
 sacrifice
 and
 that
 if
 one
 came
 to
 make
 an
 offering
 at
 the
 altar
 and
 remembered
 that
 he
 was
 at
 enmity
 with
 his
 brother
 he
 should
 first
 go
 to
 that
 brother
 and
 be
 reconciled
 even
 though
 such
 a
 course
 involved
 the
 interruption
 of
 the
 ceremonial
 which
 was
 a
 particularly
 grievous
 incident
 according
 to
 the
 judgment
 of
 the
 priests
 Differences
 and
 contentions
 were
 to
 be
 adjusted
 without
 delay
 The
 law
 forbade
 the
 awful
 sin
 of
 adultery
 Christ
 said
 that
 the
 sin
 began
 in
 the
 lustful
 glance
 the
 sensual
 thought
 and
 He
 added
 that
 it
 was
 better
 to
 become
 blind
 than
 to
 look
 with
 evil
 eye
 better
 to
 lose
 a
 hand
 than
 to
 work
 iniquity
 therewith
 Touching
 the
 matter
 of
 divorcement
 in
 which
 great
 laxity
 prevailed
 in
 that
 day
 Jesus
 declared
 that
 except
 for
 the
 most
 serious
 offense
 of
 infidelity
 to
 marriage
 vows
 no
 man
 could
 divorce
 his
 wife
 without
 becoming
 himself
 an
 offender
 in
 that
 she
 marrying
 again
 while
 still
 a
 wife
 not
 righteously
 divorced
 would
 be
 guilty
 of
 sin
 and
 so
 would
 be
 the
 man
 to
 whom
 she
 was
 so
 married
 Of
 old
 it
 had
 been
 forbidden
 to
 swear
 or
 take
 oaths
 except
 in
 solemn
 covenant
 before
 the
 Lord
 but
 in
 the
 gospel
 dispensation
 the
 Lord
 forbade
 that
 men
 swear
 at
 all
 and
 the
 heinousness
 of
 wanton
 oaths
 was
 expounded
 Grievously
 sinful
 indeed
 it
 was
 and
 is
 to
 swear
 by
 heaven
 which
 is
 the
 abode
 of
 God
 or
 by
 earth
 which
 is
 His
 creation
 and
 by
 Him
 called
 His
 footstool
 or
 by
 Jerusalem
 which
 was
 regarded
 by
 those
 who
 swore
 as
 the
 city
 of
 the
 great
 King
 or
 by
 ones
 own
 head
 which
 is
 part
 of
 the
 body
 God
 has
 created
 Moderation
 in
 speech
 decision
 and
 simplicity
 were
 enjoined
 to
 the
 exclusion
 of
 expletives
 profanity
 and
 oaths
 Of
 old
 the
 principle
 of
 retaliation
 had
 been
 tolerated
 by
 which
 one
 who
 had
 suffered
 injury
 could
 exact
 or
 inflict
 a
 penalty
 of
 the
 same
 nature
 as
 the
 offense
 Thus
 an
 eye
 was
 demanded
 for
 the
 loss
 of
 an
 eye
 a
 tooth
 for
 a
 tooth
 a
 life
 for
 a
 life
 In
 contrast
 Christ
 taught
 that
 men
 should
 rather
 suffer
 than
 do
 evil
 even
 to
 the
 extent
 of
 submission
 without
 resistance
 under
 certain
 implied
 conditions
 His
 forceful
 illustrationsthat
 if
 one
 were
 smitten
 on
 one
 cheek
 he
 should
 turn
 the
 other
 to
 the
 smiter
 that
 if
 a
 man
 took
 anothers
 coat
 by
 process
 of
 law
 the
 loser
 should
 allow
 his
 cloak
 to
 be
 taken
 also
 that
 if
 one
 was
 pressed
 into
 service
 to
 carry
 anothers
 burden
 a
 mile
 he
 should
 willingly
 go
 two
 miles
 that
 one
 should
 readily
 give
 or
 lend
 as
 askedare
 not
 to
 be
 construed
 as
 commanding
 abject
 subserviency
 to
 unjust
 demands
 nor
 as
 an
 abrogation
 of
 the
 principle
 of
 selfprotection
 These
 instructions
 were
 directed
 primarily
 to
 the
 apostles
 who
 would
 be
 professedly
 devoted
 to
 the
 work
 of
 the
 kingdom
 to
 the
 exclusion
 of
 all
 other
 interests
 In
 their
 ministry
 it
 would
 be
 better
 to
 suffer
 material
 loss
 or
 personal
 indignity
 and
 imposition
 at
 the
 hands
 of
 wicked
 oppressors
 than
 to
 bring
 about
 an
 impairment
 of
 efficiency
 and
 a
 hindrance
 in
 work
 through
 resistance
 and
 contention
 To
 such
 as
 these
 the
 Beatitudes
 were
 particularly
 applicableBlessed
 are
 the
 meek
 the
 peacemakers
 and
 they
 that
 are
 persecuted
 for
 righteousness
 sake
 Of
 old
 it
 had
 been
 said
 Love
 thy
 neighbour
 and
 hate
 thine
 enemy
 but
 the
 Lord
 now
 taught
 Love
 your
 enemies
 bless
 them
 that
 curse
 you
 do
 good
 to
 them
 that
 hate
 you
 and
 pray
 for
 them
 which
 despitefully
 use
 you
 and
 persecute
 you
 This
 was
 a
 new
 doctrine
 Never
 before
 had
 Israel
 been
 required
 to
 love
 their
 foes
 Friendship
 for
 enemies
 had
 found
 no
 place
 in
 the
 Mosaic
 code
 indeed
 the
 people
 had
 grown
 to
 look
 upon
 Israels
 enemies
 as
 Gods
 enemies
 and
 now
 Jesus
 required
 that
 tolerance
 mercy
 and
 even
 love
 be
 meted
 out
 to
 such
 He
 supplemented
 the
 requirement
 by
 an
 explanationthrough
 the
 course
 indicated
 by
 Him
 men
 may
 become
 children
 of
 God
 like
 unto
 their
 Heavenly
 Father
 to
 the
 extent
 of
 their
 obedience
 for
 the
 Father
 is
 kind
 longsuffering
 and
 tolerant
 causing
 His
 sun
 to
 shine
 on
 the
 evil
 and
 on
 the
 good
 and
 sending
 rain
 for
 the
 sustenance
 of
 both
 just
 and
 unjust
 And
 further
 what
 excellence
 has
 the
 man
 who
 gives
 only
 as
 he
 receives
 acknowledges
 only
 those
 who
 salute
 him
 with
 respect
 loves
 only
 as
 he
 is
 loved
 Even
 the
 publicans
 did
 that
 much
 Of
 the
 disciples
 of
 Christ
 much
 more
 was
 expected
 The
 admonition
 closing
 this
 division
 of
 the
 discourse
 is
 an
 effective
 and
 comprehensive
 summary
 of
 all
 that
 had
 preceded
 Be
 ye
 therefore
 perfect
 even
 as
 your
 Father
 which
 is
 in
 heaven
 is
 perfect
 SINCERITY
 OF
 PURPOSE
 In
 the
 matter
 of
 almsgiving
 the
 Master
 warned
 against
 and
 inferentially
 denounced
 ostentation
 and
 hypocritical
 display
 To
 give
 to
 the
 needy
 is
 praiseworthy
 but
 to
 give
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 winning
 the
 praise
 of
 men
 is
 rank
 hypocrisy
 The
 tossing
 of
 alms
 to
 a
 beggar
 the
 pouring
 of
 offerings
 into
 the
 temple
 treasure
 chests
 to
 be
 seen
 of
 men
 and
 similar
 displays
 of
 affected
 liberality
 were
 fashionable
 among
 certain
 classes
 in
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 and
 the
 same
 spirit
 is
 manifest
 today
 Some
 there
 be
 now
 who
 cause
 a
 trumpet
 to
 be
 sounded
 through
 the
 columns
 of
 the
 press
 perchance
 or
 by
 other
 means
 of
 publicity
 to
 call
 attention
 to
 their
 giving
 that
 they
 may
 have
 glory
 of
 mento
 win
 political
 favor
 to
 increase
 their
 trade
 or
 influence
 to
 get
 what
 in
 their
 estimation
 is
 worth
 more
 than
 that
 from
 which
 they
 part
 With
 logical
 incisiveness
 the
 Master
 demonstrated
 that
 such
 givers
 have
 their
 reward
 They
 have
 received
 what
 they
 bid
 for
 what
 more
 can
 such
 men
 demand
 or
 consistently
 expect
 But
 said
 the
 Lord
 when
 thou
 doest
 alms
 let
 not
 thy
 left
 hand
 know
 what
 thy
 right
 hand
 doeth
 That
 thine
 alms
 may
 be
 in
 secret
 and
 thy
 Father
 which
 seeth
 in
 secret
 himself
 shall
 reward
 thee
 openly
 In
 the
 same
 spirit
 did
 the
 Preacher
 denounce
 hypocritical
 prayersthe
 saying
 of
 prayers
 in
 place
 of
 praying
 There
 were
 many
 who
 sought
 places
 of
 public
 resort
 in
 the
 synagogs
 and
 even
 on
 the
 streetcorners
 that
 they
 might
 be
 seen
 and
 heard
 of
 men
 when
 saying
 their
 prayers
 They
 secured
 the
 publicity
 they
 sought
 what
 more
 could
 they
 ask
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 They
 have
 their
 reward
 He
 who
 would
 really
 praypray
 as
 nearly
 as
 possible
 as
 Christ
 prayed
 pray
 in
 actual
 communion
 with
 God
 to
 whom
 the
 prayer
 is
 addressedwill
 seek
 privacy
 seclusion
 isolation
 if
 opportunity
 permits
 he
 will
 retire
 to
 his
 chamber
 and
 will
 shut
 the
 door
 that
 none
 may
 intrude
 there
 he
 may
 pray
 indeed
 if
 the
 spirit
 of
 prayer
 be
 in
 his
 heart
 and
 this
 course
 was
 commended
 by
 the
 Lord
 Wordy
 supplications
 made
 up
 largely
 of
 iterations
 and
 repetitions
 such
 as
 the
 heathen
 use
 thinking
 that
 their
 idol
 deities
 will
 be
 pleased
 with
 their
 much
 speaking
 were
 forbidden
 It
 is
 well
 to
 know
 that
 prayer
 is
 not
 compounded
 of
 words
 words
 that
 may
 fail
 to
 express
 what
 one
 desires
 to
 say
 words
 that
 so
 often
 cloak
 inconsistencies
 words
 that
 may
 have
 no
 deeper
 source
 than
 the
 physical
 organs
 of
 speech
 words
 that
 may
 be
 spoken
 to
 impress
 mortal
 ears
 The
 dumb
 may
 pray
 and
 that
 too
 with
 the
 eloquence
 that
 prevails
 in
 heaven
 Prayer
 is
 made
 up
 of
 heart
 throbs
 and
 the
 righteous
 yearnings
 of
 the
 soul
 of
 supplication
 based
 on
 the
 realization
 of
 need
 of
 contrition
 and
 pure
 desire
 If
 there
 lives
 a
 man
 who
 has
 never
 really
 prayed
 that
 man
 is
 a
 being
 apart
 from
 the
 order
 of
 the
 divine
 in
 human
 nature
 a
 stranger
 in
 the
 family
 of
 Gods
 children
 Prayer
 is
 for
 the
 uplifting
 of
 the
 suppliant
 God
 without
 our
 prayers
 would
 be
 God
 but
 we
 without
 prayer
 cannot
 be
 admitted
 to
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 So
 did
 Christ
 instruct
 your
 Father
 knoweth
 what
 things
 ye
 have
 need
 of
 before
 ye
 ask
 him
 Then
 gave
 He
 unto
 those
 who
 sought
 wisdom
 at
 His
 feet
 a
 model
 prayer
 saying
 After
 this
 manner
 therefore
 pray
 ye
 Our
 Father
 which
 art
 in
 heaven
 Hallowed
 by
 thy
 name
 In
 this
 we
 acknowledge
 the
 relation
 we
 bear
 to
 our
 Heavenly
 Father
 and
 while
 reverencing
 His
 great
 and
 holy
 Name
 we
 avail
 ourselves
 of
 the
 inestimable
 privilege
 of
 approaching
 Him
 less
 with
 the
 thought
 of
 His
 infinite
 glory
 as
 the
 Creator
 of
 all
 that
 is
 the
 Supreme
 Being
 above
 all
 creation
 than
 with
 the
 loving
 realization
 that
 He
 is
 Father
 and
 that
 we
 are
 His
 children
 This
 is
 the
 earliest
 Biblical
 scripture
 giving
 instruction
 permission
 or
 warrant
 for
 addressing
 God
 directly
 as
 Our
 Father
 Therein
 is
 expressed
 the
 reconciliation
 which
 the
 human
 family
 estranged
 through
 sin
 may
 attain
 by
 the
 means
 provided
 through
 the
 well
 beloved
 Son
 This
 instruction
 is
 equally
 definite
 in
 demonstrating
 the
 brotherhood
 between
 Christ
 and
 humanity
 As
 He
 prayed
 so
 pray
 we
 to
 the
 same
 Father
 we
 as
 brethren
 and
 Christ
 as
 our
 Elder
 Brother
 Thy
 kingdom
 come
 Thy
 will
 be
 done
 in
 earth
 as
 it
 is
 in
 heaven
 The
 kingdom
 of
 God
 is
 to
 be
 a
 kingdom
 of
 order
 in
 which
 toleration
 and
 the
 recognition
 of
 individual
 rights
 shall
 prevail
 One
 who
 really
 prays
 that
 this
 kingdom
 come
 will
 strive
 to
 hasten
 its
 coming
 by
 living
 according
 to
 the
 law
 of
 God
 His
 effort
 will
 be
 to
 keep
 himself
 in
 harmony
 with
 the
 order
 of
 the
 kingdom
 to
 subject
 the
 flesh
 to
 the
 spirit
 selfishness
 to
 altruism
 and
 to
 learn
 to
 love
 the
 things
 that
 God
 loves
 To
 make
 the
 will
 of
 God
 supreme
 on
 earth
 as
 it
 is
 in
 heaven
 is
 to
 be
 allied
 with
 God
 in
 the
 affairs
 of
 life
 There
 are
 many
 who
 profess
 belief
 that
 as
 God
 is
 omnipotent
 all
 that
 is
 is
 according
 to
 His
 will
 Such
 a
 supposition
 is
 unscriptural
 unreasonable
 and
 untrue
 Wickedness
 is
 not
 in
 harmony
 with
 His
 will
 falsehood
 hypocrisy
 vice
 and
 crime
 are
 not
 Gods
 gifts
 to
 man
 By
 His
 will
 these
 monstrosities
 that
 have
 developed
 as
 hideous
 deformities
 in
 human
 nature
 and
 life
 shall
 be
 abolished
 and
 this
 blessed
 consummation
 shall
 be
 reached
 when
 by
 choice
 without
 surrender
 or
 abrogation
 of
 their
 free
 agency
 men
 shall
 do
 the
 will
 of
 God
 Give
 us
 this
 day
 our
 daily
 bread
 Food
 is
 indispensable
 to
 life
 As
 we
 need
 it
 we
 should
 ask
 for
 it
 True
 the
 Father
 knows
 our
 need
 before
 we
 ask
 but
 by
 asking
 we
 acknowledge
 Him
 as
 the
 Giver
 and
 are
 made
 humble
 grateful
 contrite
 and
 reliant
 by
 the
 request
 Though
 the
 sun
 shines
 and
 the
 rain
 falls
 alike
 upon
 the
 just
 and
 the
 unjust
 the
 righteous
 man
 is
 grateful
 for
 these
 blessings
 the
 ungodly
 man
 receives
 the
 benefits
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 course
 with
 a
 soul
 incapable
 of
 gratitude
 The
 capacity
 to
 be
 grateful
 is
 a
 blessing
 for
 the
 possession
 of
 which
 we
 should
 be
 further
 grateful
 We
 are
 taught
 to
 pray
 day
 by
 day
 for
 the
 food
 we
 need
 not
 for
 a
 great
 store
 to
 be
 laid
 by
 for
 the
 distant
 future
 Israel
 in
 the
 desert
 received
 manna
 as
 a
 daily
 supply
 and
 were
 kept
 in
 mind
 of
 their
 reliance
 upon
 Him
 who
 gave
 The
 man
 with
 much
 finds
 it
 easier
 to
 forget
 his
 dependence
 than
 he
 who
 must
 ask
 with
 each
 succeeding
 day
 of
 need
 And
 forgive
 us
 our
 debts
 as
 we
 forgive
 our
 debtors
 He
 who
 can
 thus
 pray
 with
 full
 intent
 and
 unmixed
 purpose
 merits
 forgiveness
 In
 this
 specification
 of
 personal
 supplication
 we
 are
 taught
 to
 expect
 only
 as
 we
 deserve
 The
 selfish
 and
 sinful
 would
 rejoice
 in
 exemption
 from
 their
 lawful
 debts
 but
 being
 selfish
 and
 sinful
 would
 exact
 the
 last
 farthing
 from
 those
 who
 owe
 them
 Forgiveness
 is
 too
 precious
 a
 pearl
 to
 be
 cast
 at
 the
 feet
 of
 the
 unforgiving
 and
 without
 the
 sincerity
 that
 springs
 from
 a
 contrite
 heart
 no
 man
 may
 justly
 claim
 mercy
 If
 others
 owe
 us
 either
 in
 actual
 money
 or
 goods
 as
 suggested
 by
 debts
 and
 debtors
 or
 through
 some
 infringement
 upon
 our
 rights
 included
 under
 the
 broader
 designation
 as
 a
 trespass
 our
 mode
 of
 dealing
 with
 them
 will
 be
 taken
 into
 righteous
 account
 in
 the
 judgment
 of
 our
 own
 offenses
 And
 lead
 us
 not
 into
 temptation
 but
 deliver
 us
 from
 evil
 The
 first
 part
 of
 this
 petition
 has
 occasioned
 comment
 and
 question
 We
 are
 not
 to
 understand
 that
 God
 would
 ever
 lead
 a
 man
 into
 temptation
 except
 perhaps
 by
 way
 of
 wise
 permission
 to
 test
 and
 prove
 him
 thereby
 affording
 him
 opportunity
 of
 overcoming
 and
 so
 of
 gaining
 spiritual
 strength
 which
 is
 the
 only
 true
 advancement
 in
 mans
 eternal
 course
 of
 progress
 The
 one
 purpose
 of
 providing
 bodies
 for
 the
 preexistent
 spirits
 of
 the
 race
 and
 of
 advancing
 them
 to
 the
 mortal
 state
 was
 to
 prove
 them
 herewith
 to
 see
 if
 they
 will
 do
 all
 things
 whatsoever
 the
 Lord
 their
 God
 shall
 command
 them
 The
 plan
 of
 mortality
 involved
 the
 certainty
 of
 temptation
 The
 intent
 of
 the
 supplication
 appears
 to
 be
 that
 we
 be
 preserved
 from
 temptation
 beyond
 our
 weak
 powers
 to
 withstand
 that
 we
 be
 not
 abandoned
 to
 temptation
 without
 the
 divine
 support
 that
 shall
 be
 as
 full
 a
 measure
 of
 protection
 as
 our
 exercize
 of
 choice
 will
 allow
 How
 inconsistent
 then
 to
 go
 as
 many
 do
 into
 the
 places
 where
 the
 temptations
 to
 which
 we
 are
 most
 susceptible
 are
 strongest
 for
 the
 man
 beset
 with
 a
 passion
 for
 strong
 drink
 to
 so
 pray
 and
 then
 resort
 to
 the
 dramshop
 for
 the
 man
 whose
 desires
 are
 lustful
 to
 voice
 such
 a
 prayer
 and
 then
 go
 where
 lust
 is
 kindled
 for
 the
 dishonest
 man
 though
 he
 say
 the
 prayer
 to
 then
 place
 himself
 where
 he
 knows
 the
 opportunity
 to
 steal
 will
 be
 found
 Can
 such
 souls
 as
 these
 be
 other
 than
 hypocrites
 in
 asking
 God
 to
 deliver
 them
 from
 the
 evils
 they
 have
 sought
 Temptation
 will
 fall
 in
 our
 way
 without
 our
 seeking
 and
 evil
 will
 present
 itself
 even
 when
 we
 desire
 most
 to
 do
 right
 for
 deliverance
 from
 such
 we
 may
 pray
 with
 righteous
 expectation
 and
 assurance
 For
 thine
 is
 the
 kingdom
 and
 the
 power
 and
 the
 glory
 for
 ever
 Amen
 Herein
 we
 acknowledge
 the
 supremacy
 of
 the
 Being
 whom
 we
 addressed
 at
 the
 beginning
 as
 Father
 He
 is
 the
 Almighty
 in
 whom
 and
 through
 whose
 provision
 we
 live
 and
 move
 and
 have
 our
 existence
 To
 assert
 independence
 of
 God
 is
 both
 sacrilege
 and
 blasphemy
 to
 acknowledge
 Him
 is
 a
 filial
 duty
 and
 a
 just
 confession
 of
 His
 majesty
 and
 dominion
 The
 Lords
 Prayer
 is
 closed
 with
 a
 solemn
 Amen
 set
 as
 a
 seal
 to
 the
 document
 of
 the
 supplication
 attesting
 its
 genuineness
 as
 the
 true
 expression
 of
 the
 suppliants
 soul
 gathering
 within
 the
 compass
 of
 a
 word
 the
 meaning
 of
 all
 that
 has
 been
 uttered
 or
 thought
 So
 let
 it
 be
 is
 the
 literal
 signification
 of
 Amen
 From
 the
 subject
 of
 prayer
 the
 Master
 turned
 to
 that
 of
 fasting
 and
 emphasized
 the
 important
 truth
 that
 to
 be
 of
 avail
 fasting
 must
 be
 a
 matter
 between
 the
 man
 and
 his
 God
 not
 between
 man
 and
 his
 kind
 It
 was
 a
 common
 thing
 in
 the
 Masters
 day
 to
 see
 men
 parading
 the
 fact
 of
 their
 abstinence
 as
 an
 advertisement
 of
 their
 assumed
 piety
 That
 they
 might
 appear
 haggard
 and
 faint
 this
 class
 of
 hypocrites
 disfigured
 their
 faces
 went
 with
 unkempt
 hair
 gazed
 about
 with
 sad
 countenances
 Of
 these
 also
 the
 Lord
 said
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 They
 have
 their
 reward
 Believers
 were
 admonished
 to
 fast
 secretly
 with
 no
 outward
 display
 and
 to
 fast
 unto
 God
 who
 could
 see
 in
 secret
 and
 would
 heed
 their
 sacrifice
 and
 prayer
 TREASURES
 OF
 EARTH
 AND
 OF
 HEAVEN
 The
 transitory
 character
 of
 worldly
 wealth
 was
 next
 contrasted
 with
 the
 enduring
 riches
 of
 eternity
 Many
 there
 were
 and
 many
 there
 are
 whose
 principal
 effort
 in
 life
 has
 been
 that
 of
 amassing
 treasures
 of
 earth
 the
 mere
 possession
 of
 which
 entails
 responsibility
 care
 and
 disturbing
 anxiety
 Some
 kinds
 of
 wealth
 are
 endangered
 by
 the
 ravages
 of
 moths
 such
 as
 silks
 and
 velvets
 satins
 and
 furs
 some
 are
 destroyed
 by
 corrosion
 and
 rustsilver
 and
 copper
 and
 steel
 while
 these
 and
 others
 are
 not
 infrequently
 made
 the
 booty
 of
 thieves
 Infinitely
 more
 precious
 are
 the
 treasures
 of
 a
 life
 well
 spent
 the
 wealth
 of
 good
 deeds
 the
 account
 of
 which
 is
 kept
 in
 heaven
 where
 the
 riches
 of
 righteous
 achievement
 are
 safe
 from
 moth
 rust
 and
 robbers
 Then
 followed
 the
 trenchant
 lesson
 For
 where
 your
 treasure
 is
 there
 will
 your
 heart
 be
 also
 Spiritual
 light
 is
 shown
 to
 be
 greater
 than
 any
 product
 of
 physical
 illuminants
 What
 does
 the
 brightest
 light
 avail
 the
 man
 who
 is
 blind
 It
 is
 the
 bodily
 eye
 that
 discerns
 the
 light
 of
 the
 candle
 the
 lamp
 or
 the
 sun
 and
 the
 spiritual
 eye
 sees
 by
 spiritual
 light
 if
 then
 mans
 spiritual
 eye
 be
 single
 that
 is
 pure
 and
 undimmed
 by
 sin
 he
 is
 filled
 with
 the
 light
 that
 shall
 show
 him
 the
 way
 to
 God
 whereas
 if
 his
 souls
 eye
 be
 evil
 he
 will
 be
 as
 one
 full
 of
 darkness
 Solemn
 caution
 is
 expressed
 in
 the
 summary
 If
 therefore
 the
 light
 that
 is
 in
 thee
 be
 darkness
 how
 great
 is
 that
 darkness
 Those
 whom
 the
 Master
 was
 addressing
 had
 received
 of
 the
 light
 of
 God
 the
 degree
 of
 belief
 they
 had
 already
 professed
 was
 proof
 of
 that
 Should
 they
 turn
 from
 the
 great
 emprise
 on
 which
 they
 had
 embarked
 the
 light
 would
 be
 lost
 and
 the
 succeeding
 darkness
 would
 be
 denser
 than
 that
 from
 which
 they
 had
 been
 relieved
 There
 was
 to
 be
 no
 indecision
 among
 the
 disciples
 No
 one
 of
 them
 could
 serve
 two
 masters
 if
 he
 professed
 so
 to
 do
 he
 would
 be
 an
 untrue
 servant
 to
 the
 one
 or
 the
 other
 Then
 followed
 another
 profound
 generalization
 Ye
 cannot
 serve
 God
 and
 mammon
 They
 were
 told
 to
 trust
 the
 Father
 for
 what
 they
 needed
 taking
 no
 thought
 of
 food
 drink
 clothing
 or
 even
 of
 life
 itself
 for
 all
 these
 were
 to
 be
 supplied
 by
 means
 above
 their
 power
 to
 control
 With
 the
 wisdom
 of
 a
 Teacher
 of
 teachers
 the
 Master
 appealed
 to
 their
 hearts
 and
 their
 understanding
 by
 citing
 the
 lessons
 of
 nature
 in
 language
 of
 such
 simple
 yet
 forceful
 eloquence
 that
 to
 amplify
 or
 condense
 it
 is
 but
 to
 mar
 Behold
 the
 fowls
 of
 the
 air
 for
 they
 sow
 not
 neither
 do
 they
 reap
 nor
 gather
 into
 barns
 yet
 your
 heavenly
 Father
 feedeth
 them
 Are
 ye
 not
 much
 better
 than
 they
 Which
 of
 you
 by
 taking
 thought
 can
 add
 one
 cubit
 unto
 his
 stature
 And
 why
 take
 ye
 thought
 for
 raiment
 Consider
 the
 lilies
 of
 the
 field
 how
 they
 grow
 they
 toil
 not
 neither
 do
 they
 spin
 And
 yet
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 even
 Solomon
 in
 all
 his
 glory
 was
 not
 arrayed
 like
 one
 of
 these
 The
 weakness
 of
 faith
 was
 reproved
 in
 the
 reminder
 that
 the
 Father
 who
 cared
 even
 for
 the
 grass
 of
 the
 field
 which
 one
 day
 flourishes
 and
 on
 the
 next
 is
 gathered
 up
 to
 be
 burned
 would
 not
 fail
 to
 remember
 His
 own
 Therefore
 the
 Master
 added
 Seek
 ye
 first
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 and
 his
 righteousness
 and
 all
 these
 things
 shall
 be
 added
 unto
 you
 HYPOCRISY
 FURTHER
 CONDEMNED
 Men
 are
 prone
 to
 judge
 their
 fellows
 and
 to
 praise
 or
 censure
 without
 due
 consideration
 of
 fact
 or

 On
 prejudiced
 or
 unsupported
 judgment
 the
 Master
 set
 His
 disapproval
 Judge
 not
 that
 ye
 be
 not

 He
 admonished
 for
 according
 to
 ones
 own
 standard
 of
 judging
 others
 shall
 he

 The

 his
 neighbors
 eye
 so
 that
 that
 neighbor
 may
 see
 things
 as
 the
 interested
 and
 interfering
 friend
 would
 have
 him
 see
 was
 denounced
 as
 a
 hypocrite
 What
 was
 the
 speck
 in
 his
 neighbors
 vision
 to
 the
 obscuring
 beam
 in
 his
 own
 eye
 Have
 the
 centuries
 between
 the
 days
 of
 Christ
 and
 our
 own
 time
 made
 us
 less
 eager
 to
 cure
 the
 defective
 vision
 of
 those
 who
 cannot
 or
 will
 not
 assume
 our
 point
 of
 view
 and
 see
 things
 as
 we
 see
 them
 These
 disciples
 some
 of
 whom
 were
 soon
 to
 minister
 in
 the
 authority
 of
 the
 Holy
 Apostleship
 were
 cautioned
 against
 the
 indiscreet
 and
 indiscriminate
 scattering
 of
 the
 sacred
 truths
 and
 precepts
 committed
 to
 them
 Their
 duty
 would
 be
 to
 discern
 the
 spirits
 of
 those
 whom
 they
 essayed
 to
 teach
 and
 to
 impart
 unto
 them
 in
 wisdom
 The
 words
 of
 the
 Master
 were
 strong
 Give
 not
 that
 which
 is
 holy
 unto
 the
 dogs
 neither
 cast
 ye
 your
 pearls
 before
 swine
 lest
 they
 trample
 them
 under
 their
 feet
 and
 turn
 again
 and
 rend
 you
 PROMISE
 AND
 REASSURANCE
 That
 their
 supplications
 would
 be
 heard
 and
 answered
 followed
 as
 a
 rich
 promise
 They
 were
 to
 ask
 and
 they
 would
 receive
 they
 were
 to
 knock
 and
 the
 door
 would
 be
 opened
 Surely
 the
 Heavenly
 Father
 would
 not
 be
 less
 considerate
 than
 a
 human
 parent
 and
 what
 father
 would
 answer
 his
 sons
 plea
 for
 bread
 by
 giving
 him
 a
 stone
 or
 who
 would
 give
 a
 serpent
 when
 a
 fish
 was
 desired
 With
 greater
 certainty
 would
 God
 bestow
 good
 gifts
 upon
 those
 who
 asked
 according
 to
 their
 need
 in
 faith
 Therefore
 all
 things
 whatsoever
 ye
 would
 that
 men
 should
 do
 to
 you
 do
 ye
 even
 so
 to
 them
 for
 this
 is
 the
 law
 and
 the
 prophets
 The
 straight
 and
 narrow
 way
 by
 which
 man
 may
 walk
 in
 Godliness
 was
 compared
 with
 the
 broad
 highway
 leading
 to
 destruction
 False
 prophets
 were
 to
 be
 shunned
 such
 as
 were
 then
 among
 the
 people
 comparable
 in
 their
 pretense
 to
 sheep
 and
 in
 their
 reality
 to
 ravening
 wolves
 These
 were
 to
 be
 recognized
 by
 their
 works
 and
 the
 results
 thereof
 even
 as
 a
 tree
 to
 be
 judged
 as
 good
 or
 bad
 according
 to
 its
 fruit
 A
 thorn
 bush
 does
 not
 produce
 grapes
 nor
 can
 thistles
 bear
 figs
 Conversely
 it
 is
 as
 truly
 impossible
 for
 a
 good
 tree
 to
 produce
 evil
 fruit
 as
 for
 a
 useless
 and
 corrupt
 tree
 to
 bring
 forth
 good
 fruit
 Religion
 is
 more
 than
 the
 confession
 and
 profession
 of
 the
 lips
 Jesus
 averred
 that
 in
 the
 day
 of
 judgment
 many
 would
 pretend
 allegiance
 to
 Him
 saying
 Lord
 Lord
 have
 we
 not
 prophesied
 in
 thy
 name
 and
 in
 thy
 name
 have
 cast
 out
 devils
 and
 in
 thy
 name
 done
 many
 wonderful
 works
 And
 then
 will
 I
 profess
 unto
 them
 I
 never
 knew
 you
 depart
 from
 me
 ye
 that
 work
 iniquity
 Only
 by
 doing
 the
 will
 of
 the
 Father
 is
 the
 saving
 grace
 of
 the
 Son
 obtainable
 To
 assume
 to
 speak
 and
 act
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Lord
 without
 the
 bestowal
 of
 authority
 such
 as
 the
 Lord
 alone
 can
 give
 is
 to
 add
 sacrilege
 to
 hypocrisy
 Even
 miracles
 wrought
 will
 be
 no
 vindication
 of
 the
 claims
 of
 those
 who
 pretend
 to
 minister
 in
 the
 ordinances
 of
 the
 gospel
 while
 devoid
 of
 the
 authority
 of
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 HEARING
 AND
 DOING
 The
 Sermon
 on
 the
 Mount
 has
 stood
 through
 all
 the
 years
 since
 its
 delivery
 without
 another
 to
 be
 compared
 with
 it
 No
 mortal
 man
 has
 ever
 since
 preached
 a
 discourse
 of
 its
 kind
 The
 spirit
 of
 the
 address
 is
 throughout
 that
 of
 sincerity
 and
 action
 as
 opposed
 to
 empty
 profession
 and
 neglect
 In
 the
 closing
 sentences
 the
 Lord
 showed
 the
 uselessness
 of
 hearing
 alone
 as
 contrasted
 with
 the
 efficacy
 of
 doing
 The
 man
 who
 hears
 and
 acts
 is
 likened
 unto
 the
 wise
 builder
 who
 set
 the
 foundation
 of
 his
 house
 upon
 a
 rock
 and
 in
 spite
 of
 rain
 and
 hurricane
 and
 flood
 the
 house
 stood
 He
 that
 hears
 and
 obeys
 not
 is
 likened
 unto
 the
 foolish
 man
 who
 built
 his
 house
 upon
 the
 sand
 and
 when
 rain
 fell
 or
 winds
 blew
 or
 floods
 came
 behold
 it
 fell
 and
 great
 was
 the
 fall
 thereof
 Such
 doctrines
 as
 these
 astonished
 the
 people
 For
 His
 distinctive
 teachings
 the
 Preacher
 had
 cited
 no
 authority
 but
 His
 own
 His
 address
 was
 free
 from
 any
 array
 of
 rabbinical
 precedents
 the
 law
 was
 superseded
 by
 the
 gospel
 For
 he
 taught
 them
 as
 one
 having
 authority
 and
 not
 as
 the
 scribes
 NOTES
 TO
 CHAPTER
 
 
 Time
 and
 Place
 of
 the
 Sermon
 on
 the
 MountMatthew
 gives
 the
 address
 early
 mention
 placing
 it
 even
 before
 the
 record
 of
 his
 own
 call
 from
 the
 seat
 of
 customwhich
 call
 certainly
 preceded
 the
 ordination
 of
 the
 Twelve
 as
 a
 bodyand
 before
 his
 account
 of
 many
 sayings
 and
 doings
 of
 the
 Lord
 already
 considered
 in
 these
 pages
 Lukes
 partial
 summary
 of
 the
 sermon
 follows
 his
 record
 of
 the
 ordination
 of
 the
 apostles
 Matthew
 tells
 us
 that
 Jesus
 had
 gone
 up
 the
 mountain
 and
 that
 He
 sat
 while
 speaking
 Lukes
 account
 suggests
 the
 inference
 that
 Jesus
 and
 the
 Twelve
 first
 descended
 from
 the
 mountain
 heights
 to
 a
 plain
 where
 they
 were
 met
 by
 the
 multitude
 and
 that
 Jesus
 preached
 unto
 them
 standing
 Critics
 who
 rejoice
 in
 trifles
 often
 to
 the
 neglect
 of
 weightier
 matters
 have
 tried
 to
 make
 much
 of
 these
 seeming
 variations
 Is
 it
 not
 probable
 that
 Jesus
 spoke
 at
 length
 on
 the
 mountainside
 to
 the
 disciples
 then
 present
 and
 from
 whom
 He
 had
 chosen
 the
 Twelve
 and
 that
 after
 finishing
 His
 discourse
 to
 them
 He
 descended
 with
 them
 to
 the
 plain
 where
 a
 multitude
 had
 assembled
 and
 that
 to
 these
 He
 repeated
 parts
 of
 what
 He
 had
 before
 spoken
 The
 relative
 fulness
 of
 Matthews
 report
 may
 be
 due
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 as
 one
 of
 the
 Twelve
 was
 present
 at
 the
 first
 and
 more
 extended
 delivery
 
 Pleasure
 Versus
 HappinessThe
 present
 is
 an
 age
 of
 pleasureseeking
 and
 men
 are
 losing
 their
 sanity
 in
 the
 mad
 rush
 for
 sensations
 that
 do
 but
 excite
 and
 disappoint
 In
 this
 day
 of
 counterfeits
 adulterations
 and
 base
 imitations
 the
 devil
 is
 busier
 than
 he
 has
 ever
 been
 in
 the
 course
 of
 human
 history
 in
 the
 manufacture
 of
 pleasures
 both
 old
 and
 new
 and
 these
 he
 offers
 for
 sale
 in
 most
 attractive
 fashion
 falsely
 labeled
 Happiness
 In
 this
 souldestroying
 craft
 he
 is
 without
 a
 peer
 he
 has
 had
 centuries
 of
 experience
 and
 practise
 and
 by
 his
 skill
 he
 controls
 the
 market
 He
 has
 learned
 the
 tricks
 of
 the
 trade
 and
 knows
 well
 how
 to
 catch
 the
 eye
 and
 arouse
 the
 desire
 of
 his
 customers
 He
 puts
 up
 the
 stuff
 in
 brightcolored
 packages
 tied
 with
 tinsel
 string
 and
 tassel
 and
 crowds
 flock
 to
 his
 bargain
 counters
 hustling
 and
 crushing
 one
 another
 in
 their
 frenzy
 to
 buy
 Follow
 one
 of
 the
 purchasers
 as
 he
 goes
 off
 gloatingly
 with
 his
 gaudy
 packet
 and
 watch
 him
 as
 he
 opens
 it
 What
 finds
 he
 inside
 the
 gilded
 wrapping
 He
 has
 expected
 fragrant
 happiness
 but
 uncovers
 only
 an
 inferior
 brand
 of
 pleasure
 the
 stench
 of
 which
 is
 nauseating
 Happiness
 includes
 all
 that
 is
 really
 desirable
 and
 of
 true
 worth
 in
 pleasure
 and
 much
 beside
 Happiness
 is
 genuine
 gold
 pleasure
 but
 gilded
 brass
 which
 corrodes
 in
 the
 hand
 and
 is
 soon
 converted
 into
 poisonous
 verdigris
 Happiness
 is
 as
 the
 genuine
 diamond
 which
 rough
 or
 polished
 shines
 with
 its
 own
 inimitable
 luster
 pleasure
 is
 as
 the
 paste
 imitation
 that
 glows
 only
 when
 artificially
 embellished
 Happiness
 is
 as
 the
 ruby
 red
 as
 the
 hearts
 blood
 hard
 and
 enduring
 pleasure
 as
 stained
 glass
 soft
 brittle
 and
 of
 but
 transitory
 beauty
 Happiness
 is
 true
 food
 wholesome
 nutritious
 and
 sweet
 it
 builds
 up
 the
 body
 and
 generates
 energy
 for
 action
 physical
 mental
 and
 spiritual
 pleasure
 is
 but
 a
 deceiving
 stimulant
 which
 like
 spirituous
 drink
 makes
 one
 think
 he
 is
 strong
 when
 in
 reality
 enfeebled
 makes
 him
 fancy
 he
 is
 well
 when
 in
 fact
 stricken
 with
 deadly
 malady
 Happiness
 leaves
 no
 bad
 aftertaste
 it
 is
 followed
 by
 no
 depressing
 reaction
 it
 calls
 for
 no
 repentance
 brings
 no
 regret
 entails
 no
 remorse
 pleasure
 too
 often
 makes
 necessary
 repentance
 contrition
 and
 suffering
 and
 if
 indulged
 to
 the
 extreme
 it
 brings
 degradation
 and
 destruction
 True
 happiness
 is
 lived
 over
 and
 over
 again
 in
 memory
 always
 with
 a
 renewal
 of
 the
 original
 good
 a
 moment
 of
 unholy
 pleasure
 may
 leave
 a
 barbed
 sting
 which
 like
 a
 thorn
 in
 the
 flesh
 is
 an
 everpresent
 source
 of
 anguish
 Happiness
 is
 not
 akin
 with
 levity
 nor
 is
 it
 one
 with
 lightminded
 mirth
 It
 springs
 from
 the
 deeper
 fountains
 of
 the
 soul

 Salt
 of
 the
 EarthDummelows
 Commentary
 on
 Matt
 
 states
 Salt
 in
 Palestine
 being
 gathered
 in
 an
 impure
 state
 often
 undergoes
 chemical
 changes
 by
 which
 its
 flavor
 is
 destroyed
 while
 its
 appearance
 remains
 Perhaps
 a
 reasonable
 interpretation
 of
 the
 expression
 if
 the
 salt
 have
 lost
 his
 savor
 may
 be
 suggested
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 salt
 mixed
 with
 insoluble
 impurities
 may
 be
 dissolved
 out
 by
 moisture
 leaving
 the
 insoluble
 residue
 but
 slightly
 salty
 The
 lesson
 of
 the
 Lords
 illustration
 is
 that
 spoiled
 salt
 is
 of
 no
 use
 as
 a
 preservative
 The
 corresponding
 passage
 in
 the
 sermon
 delivered
 by
 Jesus
 to
 the
 Nephites
 after
 His
 resurrection
 reads
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 I
 give
 unto
 you
 to
 be
 the
 salt
 of
 the
 earth
 but
 if
 the
 salt
 shall
 lose
 its
 savor
 wherewith
 shall
 the
 earth
 be
 salted
 The
 salt
 shall
 be
 thenceforth
 good
 for
 nothing
 but
 to
 be
 cast
 out
 and
 to
 be
 trodden
 under
 foot
 of
 men

 Reference
 to
 PublicansObserve
 that
 Matthew
 who
 had
 been
 a
 publican
 frankly
 records
 this
 reference
 
 
 to
 his
 despized
 class
 Luke
 writes
 sinners
 instead
 of
 publicans
 
 Of
 course
 if
 the
 accounts
 of
 the
 two
 writers
 refer
 to
 separate
 addresses
 see
 Note
 
 above
 both
 may
 be
 accurate
 But
 we
 find
 Matthews
 designation
 of
 himself
 as
 a
 publican
 in
 his
 list
 of
 the
 apostles
 
 and
 the
 considerate
 omission
 of
 the
 unenviable
 title
 by
 the
 other
 evangelists

 be
 construed
 otherwise
 than
 as
 implying
 the
 possibility
 of
 such
 achievement
 Plainly
 however
 man
 cannot
 become
 perfect
 in
 mortality
 in
 the
 sense
 in
 which
 God
 is
 perfect
 as
 a
 supremely
 glorified
 Being
 It
 is
 possible
 though
 for
 man
 to
 be
 perfect
 in
 his
 sphere
 in
 a
 sense
 analogous
 to
 that
 in
 which
 superior
 intelligences
 are
 perfect
 in
 their
 several
 spheres
 yet
 the
 relative
 perfection
 of
 the
 lower
 is
 infinitely
 inferior
 to
 that
 of
 the
 higher
 A
 college
 student
 in
 his
 freshman
 or
 sophomore
 year
 may
 be
 perfect
 as
 freshman
 or
 sophomore
 his
 record
 may
 possibly
 be
 a
 hundred
 per
 cent
 on
 the
 scale
 of
 efficiency
 and
 achievement
 yet
 the
 honors
 of
 the
 upper
 classman
 are
 beyond
 him
 and
 the
 attainment
 of
 graduation
 is
 to
 him
 remote
 but
 of
 assured
 possibility
 if
 he
 do
 but
 continue
 faithful
 and
 devoted
 to
 the
 end

 CHAPTER
 
 AS
 ONE
 HAVING
 AUTHORITY
 Matthews
 account
 of
 the
 invaluable
 address
 known
 to
 us
 as
 the
 Sermon
 on
 the
 Mount
 is
 closed
 with
 a
 forceful
 sentence
 of
 his
 own
 referring
 to
 the
 effect
 of
 the
 Masters
 words
 upon
 the
 people
 For
 he
 taught
 them
 as
 one
 having
 authority
 and
 not
 as
 the
 scribes
 A
 striking
 characteristic
 of
 Christs
 ministry
 was
 the
 entire
 absence
 of
 any
 claim
 of
 human
 authority
 for
 His
 words
 or
 deeds
 the
 commission
 He
 professed
 to
 have
 was
 that
 of
 the
 Father
 who
 sent
 Him
 His
 addresses
 whether
 delivered
 to
 multitudes
 or
 spoken
 in
 relative
 privacy
 to
 few
 were
 free
 from
 the
 labored
 citations
 in
 which
 the
 teachers
 of
 the
 day
 delighted
 His
 authoritative
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 took
 the
 place
 of
 invocation
 of
 authority
 and
 exceeded
 any
 possible
 array
 of
 precedent
 commandment
 or
 deduction
 In
 this
 His
 words
 differed
 essentially
 from
 the
 erudite
 utterances
 of
 scribes
 Pharisees
 and
 rabbis
 Throughout
 His
 ministry
 inherent
 power
 and
 authority
 were
 manifest
 over
 matter
 and
 the
 forces
 of
 nature
 over
 men
 and
 demons
 over
 life
 and
 death
 It
 now
 becomes
 our
 purpose
 to
 consider
 a
 number
 of
 instances
 in
 which
 the
 Lords
 power
 was
 demonstrated
 in
 divers
 mighty
 works
 THE
 CENTURIONS
 SERVANT
 HEALED
 From
 the
 Mount
 of
 Beatitudes
 Jesus
 returned
 to
 Capernaum
 whether
 directly
 or
 by
 a
 longer
 way
 marked
 by
 other
 works
 of
 power
 and
 mercy
 is
 of
 little
 importance
 There
 was
 at
 that
 time
 a
 Roman
 garrison
 in
 the
 city
 A
 military
 officer
 a
 centurion
 or
 captain
 of
 a
 hundred
 men
 was
 stationed
 there
 Attached
 to
 the
 household
 of
 this
 officer
 was
 an
 esteemed
 servant
 who
 was
 ill
 and
 ready
 to
 die
 The
 centurion
 had
 faith
 that
 Christ
 could
 heal
 his
 servant
 and
 invoked
 the
 intercession
 of
 the
 Jewish
 elders
 to
 beg
 of
 the
 Master
 the
 boon
 desired
 These
 elders
 implored
 Jesus
 most
 earnestly
 and
 urged
 the
 worthiness
 of
 the
 man
 who
 though
 a
 Gentile
 loved
 the
 people
 of
 Israel
 and
 out
 of
 his
 munificence
 had
 built
 for
 them
 a
 synagog
 in
 the
 town
 Jesus
 went
 with
 the
 elders
 but
 the
 centurion
 probably
 learning
 of
 the
 approach
 of
 the
 little
 company
 hastily
 sent
 other
 envoys
 to
 say
 that
 he
 did
 not
 consider
 himself
 worthy
 to
 have
 Jesus
 enter
 his
 home
 from
 which
 sense
 of
 unworthiness
 he
 had
 not
 ventured
 to
 make
 his
 request
 in
 person
 But
 ran
 the
 message
 of
 supplication
 say
 in
 a
 word
 and
 my
 servant
 shall
 be
 healed
 We
 may
 well
 contrast
 this
 mans
 conception
 of
 Christs
 power
 with
 that
 of
 the
 nobleman
 of
 the
 same
 town
 who
 had
 requested
 Jesus
 to
 hasten
 in
 person
 to
 the
 side
 of
 his
 dying
 son
 The
 centurion
 seems
 to
 have
 reasoned
 in
 this
 way
 He
 himself
 was
 a
 man
 of
 authority
 though
 under
 the
 direction
 of
 superior
 officers
 To
 his
 subordinates
 he
 gave
 orders
 which
 were
 obeyed
 He
 did
 not
 find
 it
 necessary
 to
 personally
 attend
 to
 the
 carrying
 out
 of
 his
 instructions
 Surely
 One
 who
 had
 such
 power
 as
 Jesus
 possessed
 could
 command
 and
 be
 obeyed
 Moreover
 the
 man
 may
 have
 heard
 of
 the
 marvelous
 restoration
 of
 the
 noblemans
 dying
 son
 in
 accomplishing
 which
 the
 Lord
 spoke
 the
 effective
 word
 when
 miles
 away
 from
 the
 sufferers
 bed
 That
 the
 centurions
 trust
 and
 confidence
 his
 belief
 and
 faith
 were
 genuine
 is
 not
 to
 be
 doubted
 since
 Jesus
 expressly
 commended
 the
 same
 The
 afflicted
 one
 was
 healed
 Jesus
 is
 said
 to
 have
 marveled
 at
 the
 centurions
 manifestation
 of
 faith
 and
 turning
 to
 the
 people
 who
 followed
 He
 thus
 spake
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 I
 have
 not
 found
 so
 great
 faith
 no
 not
 in
 Israel
 This
 remark
 may
 have
 caused
 some
 of
 the
 listeners
 to
 wonder
 the
 Jews
 were
 unaccustomed
 to
 hear
 the
 faith
 of
 a
 Gentile
 so
 extolled
 for
 according
 to
 the
 traditionalism
 of
 the
 day
 a
 Gentile
 even
 though
 an
 earnest
 proselyte
 to
 Judaism
 was
 accounted
 essentially
 inferior
 to
 even
 the
 least
 worthy
 of
 the
 chosen
 people
 Our
 Lords
 comment
 plainly
 indicated
 that
 Gentiles
 would
 be
 preferred
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 if
 they
 excelled
 in
 worthiness
 Turning
 to
 Matthews
 record
 we
 find
 this
 additional
 teaching
 introduced
 as
 usual
 with
 I
 say
 unto
 youThat
 many
 shall
 come
 from
 the
 east
 and
 west
 and
 shall
 sit
 down
 with
 Abraham
 and
 Isaac
 and
 Jacob
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 But
 the
 children
 of
 the
 kingdom
 shall
 be
 cast
 out
 into
 outer
 darkness
 there
 shall
 be
 weeping
 and
 gnashing
 of
 teeth
 This
 lesson
 that
 the
 supremacy
 of
 Israel
 can
 be
 attained
 only
 through
 excellence
 in
 righteousness
 is
 reiterated
 and
 enlarged
 upon
 in
 the
 Lords
 teachings
 as
 we
 shall
 see
 A
 YOUNG
 MAN
 OF
 NAIN
 RAISED
 FROM
 THE
 DEAD
 On
 the
 day
 after
 that
 of
 the
 miracle
 last
 considered
 Jesus
 went
 to
 the
 little
 town
 of
 Nain
 and
 as
 usual
 many
 people
 accompanied
 Him
 This
 day
 witnessed
 what
 in
 human
 estimation
 was
 a
 wonder
 greater
 than
 any
 before
 wrought
 by
 Him
 He
 had
 already
 healed
 many
 sometimes
 by
 a
 word
 spoken
 to
 afflicted
 ones
 present
 and
 again
 when
 He
 was
 far
 from
 the
 subject
 of
 His
 beneficent
 power
 bodily
 diseases
 had
 been
 overcome
 and
 demons
 had
 been
 rebuked
 at
 His
 command
 but
 though
 the
 sick
 who
 were
 nigh
 unto
 death
 had
 been
 saved
 from
 the
 grave
 we
 have
 no
 earlier
 record
 of
 our
 Lord
 having
 commanded
 dread
 death
 itself
 to
 give
 back
 one
 it
 had
 claimed
 As
 Jesus
 and
 His
 followers
 approached
 the
 town
 they
 met
 a
 funeral
 cortege
 of
 many
 people
 the
 only
 son
 of
 a
 widow
 was
 being
 borne
 to
 the
 tomb
 the
 body
 was
 carried
 according
 to
 the
 custom
 of
 the
 day
 on
 an
 open
 bier
 Our
 Lord
 looked
 with
 compassion
 upon
 the
 sorrowing
 mother
 now
 bereft
 of
 both
 husband
 and
 son
 and
 feeling
 in
 Himself
 the
 pain
 of
 her
 grief
 He
 said
 in
 gentle
 tone
 Weep
 not
 He
 touched
 the
 stretcher
 upon
 which
 the
 dead
 man
 lay
 and
 the
 bearers
 stood
 still
 Then
 addressing
 the
 corpse
 He
 said
 Young
 man
 I
 say
 unto
 thee
 Arise
 And
 the
 dead
 heard
 the
 voice
 of
 Him
 who
 is
 Lord
 of
 all
 and
 immediately
 sat
 up
 and
 spoke
 Graciously
 Jesus
 delivered
 the
 young
 man
 to
 his
 mother
 We
 read
 without
 wonder
 that
 there
 came
 a
 fear
 on
 all
 who
 were
 present
 and
 that
 they
 glorified
 God
 testifying
 that
 a
 great
 prophet
 was
 amongst
 them
 and
 that
 God
 has
 visited
 His
 people
 Reports
 of
 this
 miracle
 were
 carried
 throughout
 the
 land
 and
 even
 reached
 the
 ears
 of
 John
 the
 Baptist
 who
 was
 confined
 in
 the
 prison
 of
 Herod
 The
 effect
 of
 the
 information
 conveyed
 to
 John
 concerning
 this
 and
 other
 mighty
 works
 of
 Christ
 now
 claims
 our
 attention
 JOHN
 BAPTISTS
 MESSAGE
 TO
 JESUS
 Even
 before
 Jesus
 had
 returned
 to
 Galilee
 after
 His
 baptism
 and
 the
 forty
 days
 of
 solitude
 in
 the
 wilderness
 John
 the
 Baptist
 had
 been
 imprisoned
 by
 order
 of
 Herod
 Antipas
 tetrarch
 of
 Galilee
 and
 Perea
 During
 the
 subsequent
 months
 of
 our
 Lords
 activities
 in
 preaching
 the
 gospel
 teaching
 the
 true
 significance
 of
 the
 kingdom
 reproving
 sin
 healing
 the
 afflicted
 rebuking
 evil
 spirits
 and
 even
 raising
 the
 dead
 to
 life
 His
 forerunner
 the
 Godfearing
 valiant
 John
 had
 lain
 a
 prisoner
 in
 the
 dungeons
 of
 Machrus
 one
 of
 the
 strongest
 of
 Herods
 citadels
 The
 tetrarch
 had
 some
 regard
 for
 John
 having
 found
 him
 to
 be
 a
 holy
 man
 and
 many
 things
 had
 Herod
 done
 on
 the
 direct
 advice
 of
 the
 Baptist
 or
 because
 of
 the
 influence
 of
 the
 latters
 general
 teaching
 Indeed
 Herod
 had
 listened
 to
 John
 gladly
 and
 had
 imprisoned
 him
 through
 a
 reluctant
 yielding
 to
 the
 importunities
 of
 Herodias
 whom
 Herod
 claimed
 as
 a
 wife
 under
 cover
 of
 an
 illegal
 marriage
 Herodias
 had
 been
 and
 legally
 was
 still
 the
 wife
 of
 Herods
 brother
 Philip
 from
 whom
 she
 had
 never
 been
 lawfully
 divorced
 and
 her
 pretended
 marriage
 to
 Herod
 Antipas
 was
 both
 adulterous
 and
 incestuous
 under
 Jewish
 law
 The
 Baptist
 had
 fearlessly
 denounced
 this
 sinful
 association
 to
 Herod
 he
 had
 said
 It
 is
 not
 lawful
 for
 thee
 to
 have
 thy
 brothers
 wife
 Though
 Herod
 might
 possibly
 have
 ignored
 this
 stern
 rebuke
 or
 at
 least
 might
 have
 allowed
 it
 to
 pass
 without
 punishment
 Herodias
 would
 not
 condone
 It
 was
 she
 not
 the
 tetrarch
 who
 most
 hated
 John
 she
 had
 a
 quarrel
 against
 him
 and
 succeeded
 in
 inducing
 Herod
 to
 have
 the
 Baptist
 seized
 and
 incarcerated
 as
 a
 step
 toward
 the
 consummation
 of
 her
 vengeful
 plan
 of
 having
 him
 put
 to
 death
 Moreover
 Herod
 feared
 an
 uprising
 of
 the
 people
 in
 the
 event
 of
 John
 being
 slain
 by
 his
 order
 In
 the
 course
 of
 his
 long
 imprisonment
 John
 had
 heard
 much
 of
 the
 marvelous
 preaching
 and
 works
 of
 Christ
 these
 things
 must
 have
 been
 reported
 to
 him
 by
 some
 of
 his
 disciples
 and
 friends
 who
 were
 allowed
 to
 visit
 him
 Particularly
 was
 he
 informed
 of
 the
 miraculous
 raising
 of
 the
 young
 man
 at
 Nain
 and
 forthwith
 he
 commissioned
 two
 of
 his
 disciples
 to
 bear
 a
 message
 of
 inquiry
 to
 Jesus
 These
 came
 to
 Christ
 and
 reported
 the
 purpose
 of
 their
 visit
 thus
 John
 Baptist
 hath
 sent
 us
 unto
 thee
 saying
 Art
 thou
 he
 that
 should
 come
 or
 look
 we
 for
 another
 The
 messengers
 found
 Jesus
 engaged
 in
 beneficent
 ministrations
 and
 instead
 of
 giving
 an
 immediate
 reply
 in
 words
 He
 continued
 His
 labor
 relieving
 in
 that
 same
 hour
 many
 who
 were
 afflicted
 by
 blindness
 or
 infirmities
 or
 who
 were
 troubled
 by
 evil
 spirits
 Then
 turning
 to
 the
 two
 who
 had
 communicated
 the
 Baptists
 question
 Jesus
 said
 Go
 your
 way
 and
 tell
 John
 what
 things
 ye
 have
 seen
 and
 heard
 how
 that
 the
 blind
 see
 the
 lame
 walk
 the
 lepers
 are
 cleansed
 the
 deaf
 hear
 the
 dead
 are
 raised
 to
 the
 poor
 the
 gospel
 is
 preached
 And
 blessed
 is
 he
 whosoever
 shall
 not
 be
 offended
 in
 me
 The
 words
 of
 Johns
 inquiring
 disciples
 were
 answered
 by
 wondrous
 deeds
 of
 beneficence
 and
 mercy
 When
 the
 reply
 was
 reported
 to
 John
 the
 imprisoned
 prophet
 could
 scarcely
 have
 failed
 to
 remember
 the
 predictions
 of
 Isaiah
 that
 by
 those
 very
 tokens
 of
 miracle
 and
 blessing
 should
 the
 Messiah
 be
 known
 and
 the
 reproof
 must
 have
 been
 convincing
 and
 convicting
 as
 he
 called
 to
 mind
 his
 own
 citations
 of
 Isaiahs
 prophecies
 when
 he
 had
 proclaimed
 in
 fiery
 withering
 eloquence
 the
 fulfilment
 of
 those
 earlier
 predictions
 in
 his
 own
 mission
 and
 in
 that
 of
 the
 Mightier
 One
 to
 whom
 he
 had
 borne
 personal
 testimony
 The
 concluding
 sentence
 of
 our
 Lords
 answer
 to
 John
 was
 the
 climax
 of
 what
 had
 preceded
 and
 a
 further
 though
 yet
 gentle
 rebuke
 of
 the
 Baptists
 defective
 comprehension
 of
 the
 Messiahs
 mission
 Blessed
 is
 he
 whosoever
 shall
 not
 be
 offended
 in
 me
 said
 the
 Lord
 Misunderstanding
 is
 the
 prelude
 to
 offense
 Gaged
 by
 the
 standard
 of
 the
 then
 current
 conception
 of
 what
 the
 Messiah
 would
 be
 the
 work
 of
 Christ
 must
 have
 appeared
 to
 many
 as
 failure
 and
 those
 who
 were
 looking
 for
 some
 sudden
 manifestation
 of
 His
 power
 in
 the
 conquest
 of
 Israels
 oppressors
 and
 the
 rehabilitation
 of
 the
 house
 of
 David
 in
 worldly
 splendor
 grew
 impatient
 then
 doubtful
 afterward
 they
 took
 offense
 and
 were
 in
 danger
 of
 turning
 in
 open
 rebellion
 against
 their
 Lord
 Christ
 has
 been
 an
 offender
 to
 many
 because
 they
 being
 out
 of
 harmony
 with
 His
 words
 and
 works
 have
 of
 themselves
 taken
 offense
 Johns
 situation
 must
 be
 righteously
 considered
 by
 all
 who
 assume
 to
 render
 judgment
 as
 to
 his
 purpose
 in
 sending
 to
 inquire
 of
 Christ
 Art
 thou
 he
 that
 should
 come
 John
 thoroughly
 understood
 that
 his
 own
 work
 was
 that
 of
 preparation
 he
 had
 so
 testified
 and
 had
 openly
 borne
 witness
 that
 Jesus
 was
 the
 One
 for
 whom
 he
 had
 been
 sent
 to
 prepare
 With
 the
 inauguration
 of
 Christs
 ministry
 Johns
 influence
 had
 waned
 and
 for
 many
 months
 he
 had
 been
 shut
 up
 in
 a
 cell
 chafing
 under
 his
 enforced
 inactivity
 doubtless
 yearning
 for
 the
 freedom
 of
 the
 open
 and
 for
 the
 locusts
 and
 wild
 honey
 of
 the
 desert
 Jesus
 was
 increasing
 while
 he
 decreased
 in
 popularity
 influence
 and
 opportunity
 and
 he
 had
 affirmed
 that
 such
 condition
 was
 inevitable
 But
 left
 in
 prison
 he
 may
 have
 become
 despondent
 and
 may
 have
 permitted
 himself
 to
 wonder
 whether
 that
 Mightier
 One
 had
 forgotten
 him
 He
 knew
 that
 were
 Jesus
 to
 speak
 the
 word
 of
 command
 the
 prison
 of
 Machrus
 could
 no
 longer
 hold
 him
 nevertheless
 Jesus
 seemed
 to
 have
 abandoned
 him
 to
 his
 fate
 which
 comprized
 not
 only
 confinement
 but
 other
 indignities
 and
 physical
 torture
 It
 may
 have
 been
 a
 part
 of
 Johns
 purpose
 to
 call
 Christs
 attention
 to
 his
 pitiable
 plight
 and
 in
 this
 respect
 his
 message
 was
 rather
 a
 reminder
 than
 a
 plain
 inquiry
 based
 on
 actual
 doubt
 Indeed
 we
 have
 good
 grounds
 for
 inference
 that
 Johns
 purpose
 in
 sending
 disciples
 to
 inquire
 of
 Christ
 was
 partly
 and
 perhaps
 largely
 designed
 to
 confirm
 in
 these
 disciples
 an
 abiding
 faith
 in
 the
 Christ
 The
 commission
 with
 which
 they
 were
 charged
 brought
 them
 into
 direct
 communication
 with
 the
 Lord
 whose
 supremacy
 they
 could
 not
 well
 fail
 to
 comprehend
 They
 were
 personal
 witnesses
 of
 His
 power
 and
 authority
 Our
 Lords
 commentary
 on
 Johns
 message
 indicated
 that
 the
 Baptist
 had
 no
 full
 understanding
 of
 what
 the
 spiritual
 kingdom
 of
 God
 comprized
 After
 the
 envoys
 had
 departed
 Jesus
 addressed
 Himself
 to
 the
 people
 who
 had
 witnessed
 the
 interview
 He
 would
 not
 have
 them
 underrate
 the
 importance
 of
 the
 Baptists
 service
 He
 reminded
 them
 of
 the
 time
 of
 Johns
 popularity
 when
 some
 of
 those
 then
 present
 and
 multitudes
 of
 others
 had
 gone
 into
 the
 wilderness
 to
 hear
 the
 prophets
 stern
 admonition
 and
 they
 had
 found
 him
 to
 be
 no
 reed
 shaken
 by
 the
 wind
 but
 a
 firm
 and
 unbending
 oak
 They
 had
 not
 gone
 to
 see
 a
 man
 in
 fashionable
 attire
 those
 who
 wore
 soft
 raiment
 were
 to
 be
 looked
 for
 in
 the
 court
 of
 the
 king
 not
 in
 the
 wilderness
 nor
 in
 the
 dungeon
 where
 John
 now
 lay
 They
 had
 found
 in
 John
 a
 prophet
 indeed
 yea
 more
 than
 a
 prophet
 For
 affirmed
 the
 Lord
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Among
 those
 that
 are
 born
 of
 women
 there
 is
 not
 a
 greater
 prophet
 than
 John
 the
 Baptist
 but
 he
 that
 is
 least
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 is
 greater
 than
 he
 What
 stronger
 testimony
 of
 the
 Baptists
 integrity
 is
 needed
 Other
 prophets
 had
 told
 of
 the
 Messiahs
 coming
 but
 John
 had
 seen
 Him
 had
 baptized
 Him
 and
 had
 been
 to
 Jesus
 as
 a
 body
 servant
 to
 his
 master
 Nevertheless
 from
 the
 day
 of
 Johns
 preaching
 to
 the
 time
 at
 which
 Christ
 then
 spoke
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 had
 been
 rejected
 with
 violence
 and
 this
 even
 though
 all
 the
 prophets
 and
 even
 the
 fundamental
 law
 had
 told
 of
 its
 coming
 and
 though
 both
 John
 and
 Christ
 had
 been
 abundantly
 predicted
 Concerning
 John
 the
 Lord
 continued
 And
 if
 ye
 will
 receive
 it
 this
 is
 Elias
 which
 was
 for
 to
 come
 He
 that
 hath
 ears
 to
 hear
 let
 him
 hear
 It
 is
 important
 to
 know
 that
 the
 designation
 Elias
 here
 applied
 by
 Jesus
 to
 the
 Baptist
 is
 a
 title
 rather
 than
 a
 personal
 name
 and
 that
 it
 has
 no
 reference
 to
 Elijah
 the
 ancient
 prophet
 called
 the
 Tishbite
 Many
 of
 those
 who
 heard
 the
 Lords
 eulogy
 on
 the
 Baptist
 rejoiced
 for
 they
 had
 accepted
 John
 and
 had
 turned
 from
 him
 to
 Jesus
 as
 from
 the
 lesser
 to
 the
 Greater
 as
 from
 the
 priest
 to
 the
 great
 High
 Priest
 as
 from
 the
 herald
 to
 the
 King
 But
 Pharisees
 and
 lawyers
 were
 present
 those
 of
 the
 class
 that
 John
 had
 so
 vehemently
 denounced
 as
 of
 a
 generation
 of
 vipers
 and
 those
 who
 had
 rejected
 the
 counsel
 of
 God
 in
 refusing
 to
 heed
 the
 Baptists
 call
 to
 repentance
 At
 this
 point
 the
 Master
 resorted
 to
 analogy
 to
 make
 His
 meaning
 clearer
 He
 compared
 the
 unbelieving
 and
 dissatisfied
 generation
 to
 fickle
 children
 at
 play
 disagreeing
 among
 themselves
 Some
 wanted
 to
 enact
 the
 pageantry
 of
 a
 mock
 wedding
 and
 though
 they
 piped
 the
 rest
 would
 not
 dance
 then
 they
 changed
 to
 a
 funeral
 procession
 and
 essayed
 the
 part
 of
 mourners
 but
 the
 others
 would
 not
 weep
 as
 the
 rules
 of
 the
 game
 required
 Ever
 critical
 ever
 skeptical
 by
 nature
 faultfinders
 and
 defamers
 hard
 of
 hearing
 and
 of
 heart
 they
 grumbled
 John
 the
 Baptist
 had
 come
 amongst
 them
 like
 the
 eremitic
 prophets
 of
 old
 as
 strict
 as
 any
 Nazarite
 refusing
 to
 eat
 with
 the
 merrymakers
 or
 drink
 with
 the
 convivial
 and
 they
 had
 said
 He
 hath
 a
 devil
 Now
 came
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 without
 austerity
 or
 hermit
 ways
 eating
 and
 drinking
 as
 a
 normal
 man
 would
 do
 a
 guest
 at
 the
 houses
 of
 the
 people
 a
 participant
 in
 the
 festivities
 of
 a
 marriage
 party
 mingling
 alike
 with
 the
 publicans
 and
 the
 Phariseesand
 they
 complained
 again
 saying
 Behold
 a
 gluttonous
 man
 and
 a
 winebibber
 a
 friend
 of
 publicans
 and
 sinners
 The
 Master
 explained
 that
 such
 inconsistency
 such
 wicked
 trifling
 with
 matters
 most
 sacred
 such
 determined
 opposition
 to
 truth
 would
 surely
 be
 revealed
 in
 their
 true
 light
 and
 the
 worthlessness
 of
 boasted
 learning
 would
 appear
 But
 said
 He
 wisdom
 is
 justified
 of
 all
 her
 children
 From
 reproof
 for
 unbelieving
 individuals
 He
 turned
 to
 unappreciative
 communities
 and
 upbraided
 the
 cities
 in
 which
 He
 had
 wrought
 so
 many
 mighty
 works
 and
 wherein
 the
 people
 repented
 not
 Woe
 unto
 thee
 Chorazin
 woe
 unto
 thee
 Bethsaida
 for
 if
 the
 mighty
 works
 which
 were
 done
 in
 you
 had
 been
 done
 in
 Tyre
 and
 Sidon
 they
 would
 have
 repented
 long
 ago
 in
 sackcloth
 and
 ashes
 But
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 It
 shall
 be
 more
 tolerable
 for
 Tyre
 and
 Sidon
 at
 the
 day
 of
 judgment
 than
 for
 you
 And
 thou
 Capernaum
 which
 art
 exalted
 unto
 heaven
 shalt
 be
 brought
 down
 to
 hell
 for
 if
 the
 mighty
 works
 which
 have
 been
 done
 in
 thee
 had
 been
 done
 in
 Sodom
 it
 would
 have
 remained
 until
 this
 day
 But
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 it
 shall
 be
 more
 tolerable
 for
 the
 land
 of
 Sodom
 in
 the
 day
 of
 judgment
 than
 for
 thee
 Seemingly
 faint
 at
 heart
 over
 the
 unbelief
 of
 the
 people
 Jesus
 sought
 strength
 in
 prayer
 With
 the
 eloquence
 of
 soul
 for
 which
 one
 looks
 in
 vain
 save
 in
 the
 anguishladen
 communion
 of
 Christ
 with
 His
 Father
 He
 voiced
 His
 reverent
 gratitude
 that
 God
 had
 imparted
 a
 testimony
 of
 the
 truth
 to
 the
 humble
 and
 simple
 rather
 than
 to
 the
 learned
 and
 great
 though
 misunderstood
 by
 men
 He
 was
 known
 for
 what
 He
 really
 was
 by
 the
 Father
 Turning
 again
 to
 the
 people
 He
 urged
 anew
 their
 acceptance
 of
 Him
 and
 His
 gospel
 and
 His
 invitation
 is
 one
 of
 the
 grandest
 outpourings
 of
 spiritual
 emotion
 known
 to
 man
 Come
 unto
 me
 all
 ye
 that
 labour
 and
 are
 heavy
 laden
 and
 I
 will
 give
 you
 rest
 Take
 my
 yoke
 upon
 you
 and
 learn
 of
 me
 for
 I
 am
 meek
 and
 lowly
 in
 heart
 and
 ye
 shall
 find
 rest
 unto
 your
 souls
 For
 my
 yoke
 is
 easy
 and
 my
 burden
 is
 light
 He
 invited
 them
 from
 drudgery
 to
 pleasant
 service
 from
 the
 wellnigh
 unbearable
 burdens
 of
 ecclesiastical
 exactions
 and
 traditional
 formalism
 to
 the
 liberty
 of
 truly
 spiritual
 worship
 from
 slavery
 to
 freedom
 but
 they
 would
 not
 The
 gospel
 He
 offered
 them
 was
 the
 embodiment
 of
 liberty
 but
 not
 of
 license
 it
 entailed
 obedience
 and
 submission
 but
 even
 if
 such
 could
 be
 likened
 unto
 a
 yoke
 what
 was
 its
 burden
 in
 comparison
 with
 the
 incubus
 under
 which
 they
 groaned
 DEATH
 OF
 JOHN
 THE
 BAPTIST
 Reverting
 to
 John
 Baptist
 in
 his
 dungeon
 solitude
 we
 are
 left
 without
 information
 as
 to
 how
 he
 received
 and
 understood
 the
 reply
 to
 his
 inquiry
 as
 brought
 by
 his
 messengers
 His
 captivity
 was
 destined
 soon
 to
 end
 though
 not
 by
 restoration
 to
 liberty
 on
 earth
 The
 hatred
 of
 Herodias
 increased
 against
 him
 An
 opportunity
 for
 carrying
 into
 effect
 her
 fiendish
 plots
 against
 his
 life
 soon
 appeared
 The
 king
 celebrated
 his
 birthday
 by
 a
 great
 feast
 to
 which
 his
 lords
 high
 captains
 and
 the
 principal
 officials
 of
 Galilee
 were
 bidden
 To
 grace
 the
 occasion
 Salome
 daughter
 of
 Herodias
 though
 not
 of
 Herod
 came
 in
 and
 danced
 before
 the
 company
 So
 enchanted
 were
 Herod
 and
 his
 guests
 that
 the
 king
 bade
 the
 damsel
 ask
 whatever
 she
 would
 and
 he
 swore
 he
 would
 give
 it
 unto
 her
 even
 though
 the
 gift
 were
 half
 of
 his
 kingdom
 She
 retired
 to
 consult
 her
 mother
 as
 to
 what
 she
 should
 ask
 and
 being
 instructed
 returned
 with
 the
 appalling
 demand
 I
 will
 that
 thou
 give
 me
 by
 and
 by
 in
 a
 charger
 the
 head
 of
 John
 the
 Baptist
 The
 king
 was
 astounded
 his
 amazement
 was
 followed
 by
 sorrow
 and
 regret
 nevertheless
 he
 dreaded
 the
 humiliation
 that
 would
 follow
 a
 violation
 of
 the
 oath
 he
 had
 sworn
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 his
 court
 so
 summoning
 an
 executioner
 he
 immediately
 gave
 the
 fatal
 order
 and
 John
 was
 forthwith
 beheaded
 in
 the
 dungeon
 The
 headsman
 returned
 carrying
 a
 dish
 in
 which
 lay
 the
 ghastly
 trophy
 of
 the
 corrupt
 queens
 vengeance
 The
 bloody
 gift
 was
 delivered
 to
 Salome
 who
 carried
 it
 with
 inhuman
 triumph
 to
 her
 mother
 Some
 of
 Johns
 disciples
 came
 secured
 the
 corpse
 laid
 it
 in
 a
 tomb
 and
 bore
 the
 tidings
 of
 his
 death
 to
 Jesus
 Herod
 was
 sorely
 troubled
 over
 the
 murder
 he
 had
 ordered
 and
 when
 later
 the
 marvels
 wrought
 by
 Jesus
 were
 reported
 to
 him
 he
 was
 afraid
 and
 said
 That
 John
 the
 Baptist
 was
 risen
 from
 the
 dead
 and
 therefore
 mighty
 works
 do
 shew
 forth
 themselves
 in
 him
 To
 those
 who
 dissented
 the
 terrified
 king
 replied
 It
 is
 John
 whom
 I
 beheaded
 he
 is
 risen
 from
 the
 dead
 So
 ended
 the
 life
 of
 the
 prophetpriest
 the
 direct
 precursor
 of
 the
 Christ
 thus
 was
 stilled
 the
 mortal
 voice
 of
 him
 who
 had
 cried
 so
 mightily
 in
 the
 wilderness
 Prepare
 ye
 the
 way
 of
 the
 Lord
 After
 many
 centuries
 his
 voice
 has
 been
 heard
 again
 as
 the
 voice
 of
 one
 redeemed
 and
 resurrected
 and
 the
 touch
 of
 his
 hand
 has
 again
 been
 felt
 in
 this
 the
 dispensation
 of
 restoration
 and
 fulness
 In
 May
 
 a
 resurrected
 personage
 appeared
 to
 Joseph
 Smith
 and
 Oliver
 Cowdery
 announced
 himself
 as
 John
 known
 of
 old
 as
 the
 Baptist
 laid
 his
 hands
 upon
 the
 two
 young
 men
 and
 conferred
 upon
 them
 the
 priesthood
 of
 Aaron
 which
 comprizes
 authority
 to
 preach
 and
 minister
 the
 gospel
 of
 repentance
 and
 of
 baptism
 by
 immersion
 for
 the
 remission
 of
 sins
 IN
 THE
 HOUSE
 OF
 SIMON
 THE
 PHARISEE
 And
 one
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 desired
 him
 that
 he
 would
 eat
 with
 him
 And
 he
 went
 into
 the
 Pharisees
 house
 and
 sat
 down
 to
 meat
 From
 the
 place
 of
 this
 incident
 in
 Lukes
 narration
 of
 events
 it
 appears
 that
 it
 may
 have
 occurred
 on
 the
 day
 of
 the
 visit
 of
 Johns
 messengers
 Jesus
 accepted
 the
 Pharisees
 invitation
 as
 He
 had
 accepted
 the
 invitations
 of
 others
 including
 even
 publicans
 and
 those
 called
 by
 the
 rabbis
 sinners
 His
 reception
 at
 Simons
 house
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 somewhat
 lacking
 in
 warmth
 hospitality
 and
 honorable
 attendance
 The
 narrative
 suggests
 an
 attitude
 of
 condescension
 on
 the
 part
 of
 the
 host
 It
 was
 the
 custom
 of
 the
 times
 to
 treat
 a
 distinguished
 guest
 with
 marked
 attention
 to
 receive
 him
 with
 a
 kiss
 of
 welcome
 to
 provide
 water
 for
 washing
 the
 dust
 from
 his
 feet
 and
 oil
 for
 anointing
 the
 hair
 of
 the
 head
 and
 the
 beard
 All
 these
 courteous
 attentions
 were
 omitted
 by
 Simon
 Jesus
 took
 His
 place
 probably
 on
 one
 of
 the
 divans
 or
 couches
 on
 which
 it
 was
 usual
 to
 partly
 sit
 partly
 recline
 while
 eating
 Such
 an
 attitude
 would
 place
 the
 feet
 of
 the
 person
 outward
 from
 the
 table
 In
 addition
 to
 these
 facts
 relating
 to
 the
 usages
 of
 the
 time
 it
 should
 be
 further
 remembered
 that
 dwellings
 were
 not
 protected
 against
 intrusion
 by
 such
 amenities
 of
 privacy
 as
 now
 prevail
 It
 was
 not
 unusual
 at
 that
 time
 in
 Palestine
 for
 visitors
 and
 even
 strangers
 usually
 men
 however
 to
 enter
 a
 house
 at
 meal
 time
 observe
 the
 procedure
 and
 even
 speak
 to
 the
 guests
 all
 without
 bidding
 or
 invitation
 Among
 those
 who
 entered
 Simons
 house
 while
 the
 meal
 was
 in
 progress
 was
 a
 woman
 and
 the
 presence
 of
 a
 woman
 though
 somewhat
 unusual
 was
 not
 strictly
 a
 social
 impropriety
 and
 could
 not
 well
 be
 forbidden
 on
 such
 an
 occasion
 But
 this
 woman
 was
 one
 of
 the
 fallen
 class
 a
 woman
 who
 had
 been
 unvirtuous
 and
 who
 had
 to
 bear
 as
 part
 of
 the
 penalty
 for
 her
 sins
 outward
 scorn
 and
 practical
 ostracism
 from
 those
 who
 professed
 to
 be
 morally
 superior
 She
 approached
 Jesus
 from
 behind
 and
 bent
 low
 to
 kiss
 His
 feet
 as
 a
 mark
 of
 humility
 on
 her
 part
 and
 of
 respectful
 homage
 to
 Him
 She
 may
 have
 been
 one
 of
 those
 who
 had
 heard
 His
 gracious
 words
 spoken
 possibly
 that
 day
 Come
 unto
 me
 all
 ye
 that
 labour
 and
 are
 heavy
 laden
 and
 I
 will
 give
 you
 rest
 Whatever
 her
 motive
 in
 coming
 she
 had
 certainly
 come
 in
 a
 repentant
 and
 deeply
 contrite
 state
 As
 she
 leaned
 over
 the
 feet
 of
 Jesus
 her
 tears
 rained
 upon
 them
 Seemingly
 oblivious
 of
 her
 surroundings
 and
 of
 disapproving
 eyes
 watching
 her
 movements
 she
 shook
 out
 her
 tresses
 and
 wiped
 the
 Lords
 feet
 with
 her
 hair
 Then
 opening
 an
 alabaster
 box
 of
 ointment
 she
 anointed
 them
 as
 a
 slave
 might
 do
 to
 his
 master
 Jesus
 graciously
 permitted
 the
 woman
 to
 proceed
 unrebuked
 and
 uninterrupted
 in
 her
 humble
 service
 inspired
 by
 contrition
 and
 reverent
 love
 Simon
 had
 observed
 the
 whole
 proceeding
 by
 some
 means
 he
 had
 knowledge
 as
 to
 the
 class
 to
 which
 this
 woman
 belonged
 and
 though
 not
 aloud
 within
 himself
 he
 said
 This
 man
 if
 he
 were
 a
 prophet
 would
 have
 known
 who
 and
 what
 manner
 of
 woman
 this
 is
 that
 toucheth
 him
 for
 she
 is
 a
 sinner
 Jesus
 read
 the
 mans
 thoughts
 and
 thus
 spake
 Simon
 I
 have
 somewhat
 to
 say
 unto
 thee
 to
 which
 the
 Pharisee
 replied
 Master
 say
 on
 Jesus
 continued
 There
 was
 a
 certain
 creditor
 which
 had
 two
 debtors
 the
 one
 owed
 five
 hundred
 pence
 and
 the
 other
 fifty
 And
 when
 they
 had
 nothing
 to
 pay
 he
 frankly
 forgave
 them
 both
 Tell
 me
 therefore
 which
 of
 them
 will
 love
 him
 most
 But
 one
 answer
 could
 be
 given
 with
 reason
 and
 that
 Simon
 gave
 though
 apparently
 with
 some
 hesitation
 or
 reserve
 He
 possibly
 feared
 that
 he
 might
 involve
 himself
 I
 suppose
 he
 ventured
 that
 he
 to
 whom
 he
 forgave
 most
 Jesus
 said
 Thou
 hast
 rightly
 judged
 and
 proceeded
 Seest
 thou
 this
 woman
 I
 entered
 into
 thine
 house
 thou
 gavest
 me
 no
 water
 for
 my
 feet
 but
 she
 hath
 washed
 my
 feet
 with
 tears
 and
 wiped
 them
 with
 the
 hairs
 of
 her
 head
 Thou
 gavest
 me
 no
 kiss
 but
 this
 woman
 since
 the
 time
 I
 came
 in
 hath
 not
 ceased
 to
 kiss
 my
 feet
 My
 head
 with
 oil
 thou
 didst
 not
 anoint
 but
 this
 woman
 hath
 anointed
 my
 feet
 with
 ointment
 The
 Pharisee
 could
 not
 fail
 to
 note
 so
 direct
 a
 reminder
 of
 his
 having
 omitted
 the
 ordinary
 rites
 of
 respect
 to
 a
 specially
 invited
 guest
 The
 lesson
 of
 the
 story
 had
 found
 its
 application
 in
 him
 even
 as
 Nathans
 parable
 had
 drawn
 from
 David
 the
 king
 a
 selfconvicting
 answer
 Wherefore
 Jesus
 continued
 I
 say
 unto
 thee
 her
 sins
 which
 are
 many
 are
 forgiven
 for
 she
 loved
 much
 but
 to
 whom
 little
 is
 forgiven
 the
 same
 loveth
 little
 Then
 to
 the
 woman
 He
 spake
 the
 words
 of
 blessed
 relief
 Thy
 sins
 are
 forgiven
 Simon
 and
 the
 others
 at
 table
 murmured
 within
 themselves
 Who
 is
 this
 that
 forgiveth
 sins
 also
 Understanding
 their
 unspoken
 protest
 Christ
 addressed
 the
 woman
 again
 saying
 Thy
 faith
 hath
 saved
 thee
 go
 in
 peace
 The
 latter
 part
 of
 the
 narrative
 brings
 to
 mind
 another
 occasion
 on
 which
 Christ
 granted
 remission
 of
 sins
 and
 because
 of
 opposition
 in
 the
 minds
 of
 some
 hearers
 opposition
 none
 the
 less
 real
 because
 unvoiced
 had
 supplemented
 His
 authoritative
 utterance
 by
 another
 pronouncement
 The
 name
 of
 the
 woman
 who
 thus
 came
 to
 Christ
 and
 whose
 repentance
 was
 so
 sincere
 as
 to
 bring
 to
 her
 grateful
 and
 contrite
 soul
 the
 assurance
 of
 remission
 is
 not
 recorded
 There
 is
 no
 evidence
 that
 she
 figures
 in
 any
 other
 incident
 recorded
 in
 scripture
 By
 certain
 writers
 she
 has
 been
 represented
 as
 the
 Mary
 of
 Bethany
 who
 shortly
 before
 Christs
 betrayal
 anointed
 the
 head
 of
 Jesus
 with
 spikenard
 but
 the
 assumption
 of
 identity
 is
 wholly
 unfounded
 and
 constitutes
 an
 unjustifiable
 reflection
 upon
 the
 earlier
 life
 of
 Mary
 the
 devoted
 and
 loving
 sister
 of
 Martha
 and
 Lazarus
 Equally
 wrong
 is
 the
 attempt
 made
 by
 others
 to
 identify
 this
 repentant
 and
 forgiven
 sinner
 with
 Mary
 Magdalene
 no
 period
 of
 whose
 life
 was
 marked
 by
 the
 sin
 of
 unchastity
 so
 far
 as
 the
 scriptures
 aver
 The
 importance
 of
 guarding
 against
 mistakes
 in
 the
 identity
 of
 these
 women
 renders
 advisable
 the
 following
 addition
 to
 the
 foregoing
 treatment
 In
 the
 chapter
 following
 that
 in
 which
 are
 recorded
 the
 incidents
 last
 considered
 Luke
 states
 that
 Jesus
 went
 throughout
 the
 region
 visiting
 every
 city
 and
 village
 preaching
 the
 gospel
 of
 the
 kingdom
 and
 showing
 the
 glad
 tidings
 thereof
 With
 Him
 on
 this
 tour
 were
 the
 Twelve
 and
 also
 certain
 women
 which
 had
 been
 healed
 of
 evil
 spirits
 and
 infirmities
 Mary
 called
 Magdalene
 out
 of
 whom
 went
 seven
 devils
 and
 Joanna
 the
 wife
 of
 Chuza
 Herods
 steward
 and
 Susanna
 and
 many
 others
 which
 ministered
 unto
 him
 of
 their
 substance
 Further
 reference
 is
 made
 to
 some
 or
 all
 of
 these
 honorable
 women
 in
 connection
 with
 the
 death
 burial
 and
 resurrection
 of
 our
 Lord
 and
 of
 Mary
 Magdalene
 particular
 mention
 appears
 Mary
 Magdalene
 whose
 second
 name
 is
 probably
 derived
 from
 her
 home
 town
 Magdala
 had
 been
 healed
 through
 the
 ministrations
 of
 Jesus
 from
 both
 physical
 and
 mental
 maladies
 the
 latter
 having
 been
 associated
 with
 possession
 by
 evil
 spirits
 Out
 of
 her
 we
 are
 told
 Christ
 had
 cast
 seven
 devils
 but
 even
 such
 grievous
 affliction
 affords
 no
 warrant
 for
 the
 assertion
 that
 the
 woman
 was
 unvirtuous
 or
 unchaste
 Mary
 Magdalene
 became
 one
 of
 the
 closest
 friends
 Christ
 had
 among
 women
 her
 devotion
 to
 Him
 as
 her
 Healer
 and
 as
 the
 One
 whom
 she
 adored
 as
 the
 Christ
 was
 unswerving
 she
 stood
 close
 by
 the
 cross
 while
 other
 women
 tarried
 afar
 off
 in
 the
 time
 of
 His
 mortal
 agony
 she
 was
 among
 the
 first
 at
 the
 sepulchre
 on
 the
 resurrection
 morning
 and
 was
 the
 first
 mortal
 to
 look
 upon
 and
 recognize
 a
 resurrected
 Beingthe
 Lord
 whom
 she
 had
 loved
 with
 all
 the
 fervor
 of
 spiritual
 adoration
 To
 say
 that
 this
 woman
 chosen
 from
 among
 women
 as
 deserving
 of
 such
 distinctive
 honors
 was
 once
 a
 fallen
 creature
 her
 soul
 seared
 by
 the
 heat
 of
 unhallowed
 lust
 is
 to
 contribute
 to
 the
 perpetuating
 of
 an
 error
 for
 which
 there
 is
 no
 excuse
 Nevertheless
 the
 false
 tradition
 arising
 from
 early
 and
 unjustifiable
 assumption
 that
 this
 noble
 woman
 distinctively
 a
 friend
 of
 the
 Lord
 is
 the
 same
 who
 admittedly
 a
 sinner
 washed
 and
 anointed
 the
 Saviors
 feet
 in
 the
 house
 of
 Simon
 the
 Pharisee
 and
 gained
 the
 boon
 of
 forgiveness
 through
 contrition
 has
 so
 tenaciously
 held
 its
 place
 in
 the
 popular
 mind
 through
 the
 centuries
 that
 the
 name
 Magdalene
 has
 come
 to
 be
 a
 generic
 designation
 for
 women
 who
 fall
 from
 virtue
 and
 afterward
 repent
 We
 are
 not
 considering
 whether
 the
 mercy
 of
 Christ
 could
 have
 been
 extended
 to
 such
 a
 sinner
 as
 Mary
 of
 Magdala
 is
 wrongly
 reputed
 to
 have
 been
 man
 cannot
 measure
 the
 bounds
 nor
 fathom
 the
 depths
 of
 divine
 forgiveness
 and
 if
 it
 were
 so
 that
 this
 Mary
 and
 the
 repentant
 sinner
 who
 ministered
 to
 Jesus
 as
 He
 sat
 at
 the
 Pharisees
 table
 were
 one
 and
 the
 same
 the
 question
 would
 stand
 affirmatively
 answered
 for
 that
 woman
 who
 had
 been
 a
 sinner
 was
 forgiven
 We
 are
 dealing
 with
 the
 scriptural
 record
 as
 a
 history
 and
 nothing
 said
 therein
 warrants
 the
 really
 repellent
 though
 common
 imputation
 of
 unchastity
 to
 the
 devoted
 soul
 of
 Mary
 Magdalene
 CHRISTS
 AUTHORITY
 ASCRIBED
 TO
 BEELZEBUB
 At
 the
 time
 of
 our
 Lords
 earthly
 ministry
 the
 curing
 of
 the
 blind
 deaf
 or
 dumb
 was
 regarded
 as
 among
 the
 greatest
 possible
 achievements
 of
 medical
 science
 or
 spiritual
 treatment
 and
 the
 subjection
 or
 casting
 out
 of
 demons
 was
 ranked
 among
 the
 attainments
 impossible
 to
 rabbinical
 exorcism
 Demonstrations
 of
 the
 Lords
 power
 to
 heal
 and
 restore
 even
 in
 cases
 universally
 considered
 as
 incurable
 had
 the
 effect
 of
 intensifying
 the
 hostility
 of
 the
 sacerdotal
 classes
 and
 they
 represented
 by
 the
 Pharisaic
 party
 evolved
 the
 wholly
 inconsistent
 and
 ridiculous
 suggestion
 that
 miracles
 were
 wrought
 by
 Jesus
 through
 the
 power
 of
 the
 prince
 of
 devils
 with
 whom
 He
 was
 in
 league
 While
 the
 Lord
 was
 making
 His
 second
 missionary
 tour
 through
 Galilee
 going
 about
 through
 all
 the
 cities
 and
 villages
 teaching
 in
 their
 synagogues
 and
 preaching
 the
 gospel
 of
 the
 kingdom
 and
 healing
 every
 sickness
 and
 every
 disease
 among
 the
 people
 the
 absurd
 theory
 that
 Christ
 was
 Himself
 a
 victim
 of
 demoniacal
 possession
 and
 that
 He
 operated
 by
 the
 power
 of
 the
 devil
 was
 urged
 and
 enlarged
 upon
 until
 it
 became
 the
 generally
 accepted
 explanation
 among
 the
 Pharisees
 and
 their
 kind
 Jesus
 had
 withdrawn
 Himself
 for
 a
 time
 from
 the
 more
 populous
 centers
 where
 He
 was
 constantly
 watched
 by
 emissaries
 whom
 the
 ruling
 classes
 had
 sent
 from
 Jerusalem
 into
 Galilee
 for
 the
 Pharisees
 were
 in
 conspiracy
 against
 Him
 seeking
 excuse
 and
 opportunity
 to
 take
 His
 life
 but
 even
 in
 the
 smaller
 towns
 and
 rural
 districts
 He
 was
 followed
 and
 beset
 by
 great
 multitudes
 to
 whom
 He
 ministered
 for
 both
 physical
 and
 spiritual
 ailments
 He
 urged
 the
 people
 to
 refrain
 from
 spreading
 His
 fame
 and
 this
 He
 may
 have
 done
 for
 the
 reason
 that
 at
 that
 stage
 of
 His
 work
 an
 open
 rupture
 with
 the
 Jewish
 hierarchy
 would
 have
 been
 a
 serious
 hindrance
 or
 possibly
 He
 desired
 to
 leave
 the
 rulers
 who
 were
 plotting
 against
 Him
 time
 and
 opportunity
 to
 brew
 their
 bitter
 enmity
 and
 fill
 to
 the
 brim
 the
 flagons
 of
 their
 determined
 iniquity
 Matthew
 sees
 in
 the
 Lords
 injunctions
 against
 publicity
 a
 fulfilment
 of
 Isaiahs
 prophecy
 that
 the
 chosen
 Messiah
 would
 not
 strive
 nor
 cry
 out
 on
 the
 street
 to
 attract
 attention
 nor
 would
 He
 use
 His
 mighty
 power
 to
 crush
 even
 a
 bruised
 reed
 or
 to
 quench
 even
 the
 smoking
 flax
 He
 would
 not
 fail
 nor
 be
 discouraged
 but
 would
 victoriously
 establish
 just
 judgment
 upon
 the
 earth
 for
 the
 Gentiles
 as
 well
 as
 by
 implication
 for
 Israel
 The
 figure
 of
 the
 bruised
 reed
 and
 the
 smoking
 flax
 is
 strikingly
 expressive
 of
 the
 tender
 care
 with
 which
 Christ
 treated
 even
 the
 weakest
 manifestation
 of
 faith
 and
 genuine
 desire
 to
 learn
 the
 truth
 whether
 exhibited
 by
 Jew
 or
 Gentile
 Soon
 after
 His
 return
 from
 the
 missionary
 tour
 referred
 to
 an
 excuse
 for
 the
 Pharisees
 to
 assail
 Him
 was
 found
 in
 His
 healing
 of
 a
 man
 who
 was
 under
 the
 influence
 of
 a
 demon
 and
 was
 both
 blind
 and
 dumb
 This
 combination
 of
 sore
 afflictions
 affecting
 body
 mind
 and
 spirit
 was
 rebuked
 and
 the
 sightless
 speechless
 demoniac
 was
 relieved
 of
 his
 threefold
 burden
 At
 this
 triumph
 over
 the
 powers
 of
 evil
 the
 people
 were
 the
 more
 amazed
 and
 said
 Is
 not
 this
 the
 son
 of
 David
 in
 other
 words
 Can
 this
 be
 any
 other
 than
 the
 Christ
 we
 have
 been
 so
 long
 expecting
 The
 popular
 judgment
 so
 voiced
 maddened
 the
 Pharisees
 and
 they
 told
 the
 almost
 adoring
 people
 This
 fellow
 doth
 not
 cast
 out
 devils
 but
 by
 Beelzebub
 the
 prince
 of
 devils
 Jesus
 took
 up
 the
 malicious
 charge
 and
 replied
 thereto
 not
 in
 anger
 but
 in
 terms
 of
 calm
 reason
 and
 sound
 logic
 He
 laid
 the
 foundation
 of
 His
 defense
 by
 stating
 the
 evident
 truth
 that
 a
 kingdom
 divided
 against
 itself
 cannot
 endure
 but
 must
 surely
 suffer
 disruption
 If
 their
 assumption
 were
 in
 the
 least
 degree
 founded
 on
 truth
 Satan
 through
 Jesus
 would
 be
 opposing
 Satan
 Then
 referring
 to
 the
 superstitious
 practises
 and
 exorcisms
 of
 the
 time
 by
 which
 some
 such
 effects
 as
 we
 class
 today
 under
 mind
 cures
 were
 obtained
 He
 asked
 If
 I
 by
 Beelzebub
 cast
 out
 devils
 by
 whom
 do
 your
 children
 cast
 them
 out
 therefore
 they
 shall
 be
 your
 judges
 And
 to
 make
 the
 demonstration
 plainer
 by
 contrast
 He
 continued
 But
 if
 I
 cast
 out
 devils
 by
 the
 Spirit
 of
 God
 then
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 is
 come
 upon
 you
 By
 the
 acceptance
 of
 either
 proposition
 and
 surely
 one
 was
 true
 for
 the
 fact
 that
 Jesus
 did
 cast
 out
 devils
 was
 known
 throughout
 the
 land
 and
 was
 conceded
 in
 the
 very
 terms
 of
 the
 charge
 now
 brought
 against
 Him
 the
 accusing
 Pharisees
 stood
 defeated
 and
 condemned
 But
 the
 illustration
 went
 further
 Jesus
 continued
 Or
 else
 how
 can
 one
 enter
 into
 a
 strong
 mans
 house
 and
 spoil
 his
 goods
 except
 he
 first
 bind
 the
 strong
 man
 and
 then
 he
 will
 spoil
 his
 house
 Christ
 had
 attacked
 the
 stronghold
 of
 Satan
 had
 driven
 his
 evil
 spirits
 from
 the
 human
 tabernacles
 of
 which
 they
 had
 unwarrantably
 taken
 possession
 how
 could
 Christ
 have
 done
 this
 had
 He
 not
 first
 subdued
 the
 strong
 man
 the
 master
 of
 devils
 Satan
 himself
 And
 yet
 those
 ignorant
 scholars
 dared
 to
 say
 in
 the
 face
 of
 such
 selfevident
 refutation
 of
 their
 own
 premises
 that
 the
 powers
 of
 Satan
 were
 subdued
 by
 Satanic
 agency
 There
 could
 be
 no
 agreement
 no
 truce
 nor
 armistice
 between
 the
 contending
 powers
 of
 Christ
 and
 Satan
 Offering
 a
 suggestion
 of
 selfjudgment
 to
 His
 accusers
 that
 they
 might
 severally
 decide
 on
 which
 side
 they
 were
 aligned
 Jesus
 added
 He
 that
 is
 not
 with
 me
 is
 against
 me
 and
 he
 that
 gathereth
 not
 with
 me
 scattereth
 abroad
 Then
 the
 demonstration
 being
 complete
 and
 the
 absurdity
 of
 His
 opponents
 assumption
 proved
 Christ
 directed
 their
 thoughts
 to
 the
 heinous
 sin
 of
 condemning
 the
 power
 and
 authority
 by
 which
 Satan
 was
 overcome
 He
 had
 proved
 to
 them
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 their
 own
 proposition
 that
 He
 having
 subdued
 Satan
 was
 the
 embodiment
 of
 the
 Spirit
 of
 God
 and
 that
 through
 Him
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 was
 brought
 to
 them
 They
 rejected
 the
 Spirit
 of
 God
 and
 sought
 to
 destroy
 the
 Christ
 through
 whom
 that
 Spirit
 was
 made
 manifest
 What
 blasphemy
 could
 be
 greater
 Speaking
 as
 one
 having
 authority
 with
 the
 solemn
 affirmation
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 He
 continued
 All
 manner
 of
 sin
 and
 blasphemy
 shall
 be
 forgiven
 unto
 men
 but
 the
 blasphemy
 against
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 shall
 not
 be
 forgiven
 unto
 men
 And
 whosoever
 speaketh
 a
 word
 against
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 it
 shall
 be
 forgiven
 him
 but
 whosover
 speaketh
 against
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 it
 shall
 not
 be
 forgiven
 him
 neither
 in
 this
 world
 neither
 in
 the
 world
 to
 come
 Who
 among
 men
 can
 word
 a
 more
 solemn
 and
 awful
 warning
 against
 the
 danger
 of
 committing
 the
 dread
 unpardonable
 sin
 Jesus
 was
 merciful
 in
 His
 assurance
 that
 words
 spoken
 against
 Himself
 as
 a
 Man
 might
 be
 forgiven
 but
 to
 speak
 against
 the
 authority
 He
 possessed
 and
 particularly
 to
 ascribe
 that
 power
 and
 authority
 to
 Satan
 was
 very
 near
 to
 blasphemy
 against
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 for
 which
 sin
 there
 could
 be
 no
 forgiveness
 Then
 in
 stronger
 terms
 which
 developed
 into
 cutting
 invective
 He
 told
 them
 to
 be
 consistentif
 they
 admitted
 that
 the
 result
 of
 His
 labors
 was
 good
 as
 the
 casting
 out
 of
 devils
 surely
 was
 to
 be
 likened
 unto
 good
 fruitwhy
 did
 they
 not
 acknowledge
 that
 the
 power
 by
 which
 such
 results
 were
 attained
 in
 other
 words
 that
 the
 tree
 itself
 was
 good
 Either
 make
 the
 tree
 good
 and
 his
 fruit
 good
 or
 else
 make
 the
 tree
 corrupt
 and
 his
 fruit
 corrupt
 for
 the
 tree
 is
 known
 by
 his
 fruit
 With
 burning
 words
 of
 certain
 conviction
 He
 continued
 O
 generation
 of
 vipers
 how
 can
 ye
 being
 evil
 speak
 good
 things
 for
 out
 of
 the
 abundance
 of
 the
 heart
 the
 mouth
 speaketh
 By
 the
 truths
 He
 had
 made
 so
 plain
 it
 was
 evident
 that
 their
 accusing
 words
 were
 drawn
 from
 hearts
 stored
 with
 evil
 treasure
 Moreover
 their
 words
 were
 shown
 to
 be
 not
 only
 malicious
 but
 foolish
 idle
 and
 vain
 and
 therefore
 doubly
 saturated
 with
 sin
 Another
 authoritative
 declaration
 followed
 But
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 every
 idle
 word
 that
 men
 shall
 speak
 they
 shall
 give
 account
 thereof
 in
 the
 day
 of
 judgment
 SEEKERS
 AFTER
 SIGNS
 The
 Masters
 lesson
 enforced
 though
 it
 was
 by
 illustration
 and
 analogy
 by
 direct
 application
 and
 by
 authoritative
 avowal
 fell
 on
 ears
 that
 were
 practically
 deaf
 to
 spiritual
 truth
 and
 found
 no
 place
 in
 hearts
 already
 stuffed
 with
 great
 stores
 of
 evil
 To
 the
 profound
 wisdom
 and
 saving
 instruction
 of
 the
 word
 of
 God
 to
 which
 they
 had
 listened
 they
 responded
 with
 a
 flippant
 request
 Master
 we
 would
 see
 a
 sign
 from
 thee
 Had
 they
 not
 already
 seen
 signs
 in
 profusion
 Had
 not
 the
 blind
 and
 the
 deaf
 the
 dumb
 and
 the
 infirm
 the
 palsied
 and
 the
 dropsical
 and
 people
 afflicted
 with
 all
 manner
 of
 diseases
 been
 healed
 in
 their
 houses
 on
 their
 streets
 and
 in
 their
 synagogs
 had
 not
 devils
 been
 cast
 out
 and
 their
 foul
 utterances
 been
 silenced
 by
 His
 word
 and
 had
 not
 the
 dead
 been
 raised
 and
 all
 by
 Him
 whom
 they
 now
 importuned
 for
 a
 sign
 They
 would
 have
 some
 surpassing
 wonder
 wrought
 to
 satisfy
 curiosity
 or
 perhaps
 to
 afford
 them
 further
 excuse
 for
 action
 against
 Himthey
 wanted
 signs
 to
 waste
 on
 their
 lust
 Small
 wonder
 that
 he
 sighed
 deeply
 in
 his
 spirit
 when
 such
 demands
 were
 made
 To
 the
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 who
 had
 shown
 such
 inattention
 to
 His
 words
 He
 replied
 An
 evil
 and
 adulterous
 generation
 seeketh
 after
 a
 sign
 and
 there
 shall
 no
 sign
 be
 given
 to
 it
 but
 the
 sign
 of
 the
 prophet
 Jonas
 The
 sign
 of
 Jonas
 or
 Jonah
 was
 that
 for
 three
 days
 he
 had
 been
 in
 the
 belly
 of
 the
 fish
 and
 then
 had
 been
 restored
 to
 liberty
 so
 would
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 be
 immured
 in
 the
 tomb
 after
 which
 He
 would
 rise
 again
 That
 was
 the
 only
 sign
 He
 would
 give
 them
 and
 by
 that
 would
 they
 stand
 condemned
 Against
 them
 and
 their
 generation
 would
 the
 men
 of
 Nineveh
 rise
 in
 judgment
 for
 they
 wicked
 as
 they
 were
 had
 repented
 at
 the
 preaching
 of
 Jonas
 and
 behold
 a
 greater
 than
 Jonas
 was
 among
 them
 The
 queen
 of
 Sheba
 would
 rise
 in
 judgment
 against
 them
 for
 she
 had
 journeyed
 far
 to
 avail
 herself
 of
 Solomons
 wisdom
 and
 behold
 a
 greater
 than
 Solomon
 stood
 before
 them
 Then
 reverting
 to
 the
 matter
 of
 unclean
 and
 evil
 spirits
 in
 connection
 with
 which
 they
 had
 spread
 the
 accusation
 that
 He
 was
 one
 of
 the
 devils
 own
 He
 told
 them
 that
 when
 a
 demon
 is
 cast
 out
 he
 tries
 after
 a
 season
 of
 loneliness
 to
 return
 to
 the
 house
 or
 body
 from
 which
 he
 had
 been
 expelled
 and
 finding
 that
 house
 in
 order
 sweet
 and
 clean
 since
 his
 filthy
 self
 had
 been
 forced
 to
 vacate
 it
 he
 calls
 other
 spirits
 more
 wicked
 than
 himself
 and
 they
 take
 possession
 of
 the
 man
 and
 make
 his
 state
 worse
 than
 it
 was
 at
 first
 In
 this
 weird
 example
 is
 typified
 the
 condition
 of
 those
 who
 have
 received
 the
 truth
 and
 thereby
 have
 been
 freed
 from
 the
 unclean
 influences
 of
 error
 and
 sin
 so
 that
 in
 mind
 and
 spirit
 and
 body
 they
 are
 as
 a
 house
 swept
 and
 garnished
 and
 set
 in
 cleanly
 order
 but
 who
 afterward
 renounce
 the
 good
 open
 their
 souls
 to
 the
 demons
 of
 falsehood
 and
 deceit
 and
 become
 more
 corrupt
 than
 before
 Even
 so
 declared
 the
 Lord
 shall
 it
 be
 also
 unto
 this
 wicked
 generation
 Though
 the
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 were
 mostly
 unconvinced
 if
 at
 all
 really
 impressed
 by
 His
 teachings
 our
 Lord
 was
 not
 entirely
 without
 appreciative
 listeners
 A
 woman
 in
 the
 company
 raised
 her
 voice
 in
 an
 invocation
 of
 blessing
 on
 the
 mother
 who
 had
 given
 birth
 to
 such
 a
 Son
 and
 on
 the
 breasts
 that
 had
 suckled
 Him
 While
 not
 rejecting
 this
 tribute
 of
 reverence
 which
 applied
 to
 both
 mother
 and
 Son
 Jesus
 answered
 Yea
 rather
 blessed
 are
 they
 that
 hear
 the
 word
 of
 God
 and
 keep
 it
 CHRISTS
 MOTHER
 AND
 BRETHREN
 COME
 TO
 SEE
 HIM
 While
 Jesus
 was
 engaged
 with
 the
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 and
 a
 great
 number
 of
 others
 possibly
 at
 or
 near
 the
 conclusion
 of
 the
 teachings
 last
 considered
 word
 was
 passed
 to
 Him
 that
 His
 mother
 and
 His
 brethren
 were
 present
 and
 desired
 to
 speak
 with
 Him
 On
 account
 of
 the
 press
 of
 people
 they
 had
 been
 unable
 to
 reach
 His
 side
 Making
 use
 of
 the
 circumstance
 to
 impress
 upon
 all
 the
 fact
 that
 His
 work
 took
 precedence
 over
 the
 claims
 of
 family
 and
 kinship
 and
 thereby
 explaining
 that
 He
 could
 not
 meet
 His
 relatives
 at
 that
 moment
 He
 asked
 Who
 is
 my
 mother
 and
 who
 are
 my
 brethren
 Answering
 His
 own
 question
 and
 expressing
 in
 the
 answer
 the
 deeper
 thought
 in
 His
 mind
 He
 said
 pointing
 toward
 His
 disciples
 Behold
 my
 mother
 and
 my
 brethren
 For
 whosoever
 shall
 do
 the
 will
 of
 my
 Father
 which
 is
 in
 heaven
 the
 same
 is
 my
 brother
 and
 sister
 and
 mother
 The
 incident
 reminds
 one
 of
 the
 answer
 He
 made
 to
 His
 mother
 when
 she
 and
 Joseph
 had
 found
 Him
 in
 the
 temple
 after
 their
 long
 and
 anxious
 search
 How
 is
 it
 that
 ye
 sought
 me
 wist
 ye
 not
 that
 I
 must
 be
 about
 my
 Fathers
 business
 In
 that
 business
 He
 was
 engaged
 when
 His
 mother
 and
 brethren
 desired
 to
 speak
 with
 Him
 as
 He
 sat
 amidst
 the
 crowd
 The
 superior
 claims
 of
 His
 Fathers
 work
 caused
 Him
 to
 let
 all
 minor
 matters
 wait
 We
 are
 not
 justified
 in
 construing
 these
 remarks
 as
 evidence
 of
 disrespect
 far
 less
 of
 filial
 and
 family
 disloyalty
 Devotion
 similar
 in
 kind
 at
 least
 was
 expected
 by
 Him
 of
 the
 apostles
 who
 were
 called
 to
 devote
 without
 reserve
 their
 time
 and
 talents
 to
 the
 ministry
 The
 purpose
 on
 which
 the

 The
 Two
 Accounts
 of
 the
 MiracleIn
 the
 commentary
 on
 the
 miraculous
 healing
 of
 the
 centurions
 servant
 as
 given
 in
 the
 text
 we
 have
 followed
 in
 the
 main
 Lukes
 more
 circumstantial
 account
 Matthews
 briefer
 statement
 of
 the
 officers
 petition
 and
 the
 Lords
 gracious
 compliance
 therewith
 represents
 the
 man
 as
 coming
 in
 person
 to
 Jesus
 while
 Luke
 refers
 to
 the
 elders
 of
 the
 local
 synagog
 as
 presenting
 the
 request
 There
 is
 here
 no
 real
 discrepancy
 It
 was
 then
 allowable
 as
 in
 our
 time
 it
 is
 to
 speak
 of
 one
 who
 causes
 something
 to
 be
 done
 as
 doing
 that
 thing
 himself
 One
 may
 properly
 be
 said
 to
 notify
 another
 when
 he
 sends
 the
 notification
 by
 a
 third
 party
 A
 man
 may
 say
 he
 has
 built
 a
 house
 when
 in
 reality
 others
 did
 the
 work
 of
 building
 though
 at
 his
 instance
 An
 architect
 may
 with
 propriety
 be
 said
 to
 have
 constructed
 a
 building
 when
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 fact
 he
 made
 the
 design
 and
 directed
 others
 who
 actually
 reared
 the
 structure
 
 Jesus
 MarveledBoth
 Matthew
 and
 Luke
 tell
 us
 that
 Jesus
 marveled
 at
 the
 faith
 shown
 by
 the
 centurion
 who
 begged
 that
 his
 beloved
 servant
 be
 healed
 Matt
 
 Luke
 
 Some
 have
 queried
 how
 Christ
 whom
 they
 consider
 to
 have
 been
 omniscient
 during
 His
 life
 in
 the
 flesh
 could
 have
 marveled
 at
 anything
 The
 meaning
 of
 the
 passage
 is
 evident
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 when
 the
 fact
 of
 the
 centurions
 faith
 was
 brought
 to
 His
 attention
 He
 pondered
 over
 it
 and
 contemplated
 it
 probably
 as
 a
 refreshing
 contrast
 to
 the
 absence
 of
 faith
 He
 so
 generally
 encountered
 In
 similar
 way
 though
 with
 sorrow
 in
 place
 of
 joy
 He
 is
 said
 to
 have
 marveled
 at
 the
 peoples
 unbelief

 Sequence
 of
 the
 Miracles
 of
 Raising
 the
 DeadAs
 stated
 and
 reiterated
 in
 the
 text
 the
 chronology
 of
 the
 events
 in
 our
 Lords
 ministry
 as
 recorded
 by
 the
 Gospelwriters
 is
 uncertain
 Literature
 on
 the
 subject
 embodies
 much
 disputation
 and
 demonstrates
 absence
 of
 any
 near
 approach
 to
 agreement
 among
 Biblical
 scholars
 We
 have
 record
 of
 three
 instances
 of
 miraculous
 restoration
 of
 the
 dead
 to
 life
 at
 the
 word
 of
 Jesusthe
 raising
 of
 the
 son
 of
 the
 widow
 of
 Nain
 the
 raising
 of
 the
 daughter
 of
 Jairus
 and
 the
 raising
 of
 Lazarus
 and
 on
 the
 sequence
 of
 two
 of
 these
 there
 is
 difference
 of
 opinion
 Of
 course
 the
 placing
 of
 the
 raising
 of
 Lazarus
 as
 the
 latest
 of
 the
 three
 is
 based
 on
 certainty
 Dr
 Richard
 C
 Trench
 in
 his
 scholarly
 and
 very
 valuable
 Notes
 on
 the
 Miracles
 of
 our
 Lord
 definitely
 asserts
 that
 the
 raising
 of
 the
 daughter
 of
 Jairus
 is
 the
 first
 of
 the
 three
 works
 of
 restoration
 to
 life
 Dr
 John
 Laidlaw
 in
 The
 Miracles
 of
 our
 Lord
 treats
 this
 first
 among
 the
 miracles
 of
 its
 class
 though
 without
 affirming
 its
 chronological
 precedence
 many
 other
 writers
 make
 it
 the
 second
 of
 the
 three
 The
 incentive
 to
 arrange
 the
 three
 miracles
 of
 this
 group
 in
 the
 sequence
 indicated
 may
 perhaps
 be
 found
 in
 the
 desire
 to
 present
 them
 in
 the
 increasing
 order
 of
 apparent
 greatnessthe
 raising
 of
 the
 damsel
 being
 an
 instance
 of
 recalling
 to
 life
 one
 who
 had
 but
 just
 died
 hardly
 dead
 as
 some
 wrongly
 describe
 her
 condition
 the
 raising
 of
 the
 young
 man
 of
 Nain
 being
 the
 restoration
 of
 one
 on
 the
 way
 to
 the
 tomb
 and
 the
 raising
 of
 Lazarus
 an
 instance
 of
 recalling
 to
 life
 one
 who
 had
 lain
 four
 days
 in
 the
 sepulchre
 We
 cannot
 consistently
 conceive
 of
 these
 cases
 as
 offering
 grades
 of
 greater
 or
 lesser
 difficulty
 to
 the
 power
 of
 Christ
 in
 each
 case
 His
 word
 of
 authority
 was
 sufficient
 to
 reunite
 the
 spirit
 and
 body
 of
 the
 dead
 person
 Luke
 the
 sole
 recorder
 of
 the
 miracle
 at
 Nain
 places
 the
 event
 before
 that
 of
 the
 raising
 of
 the
 daughter
 of
 Jairus
 with
 many
 incidents
 between
 The
 great
 preponderance
 of
 evidence
 is
 in
 favor
 of
 considering
 the
 three
 miracles
 in
 the
 order
 followed
 herein
 
 the
 raising
 of
 the
 young
 man
 of
 Nain
 
 that
 of
 the
 daughter
 of
 Jairus
 and
 
 that
 of
 Lazarus
 
 TetrarchThis
 title
 by
 derivation
 of
 the
 term
 and
 as
 originally
 used
 was
 applied
 to
 the
 ruler
 of
 a
 fourth
 part
 or
 one
 of
 four
 divisions
 of
 a
 region
 that
 had
 formerly
 been
 one
 country
 Later
 it
 came
 to
 be
 the
 designation
 of
 any
 ruler
 or
 governor
 over
 a
 part
 of
 a
 divided
 country
 irrespective
 of
 the
 number
 or
 extent
 of
 the
 fractions
 Herod
 Antipas
 is
 distinctively
 called
 the
 tetrarch
 in
 Matt
 
 Luke
 
 
 
 and
 Acts
 
 and
 is
 referred
 to
 as
 king
 in
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 
 
 
 
 MachrusAccording
 to
 the
 historian
 Josephus
 Antiquities
 xviii
 
 the
 prison
 to
 which
 John
 the
 Baptist
 was
 consigned
 by
 Herod
 Antipas
 was
 the
 strong
 fortress
 Machrus
 
 Christ
 an
 Offender
 to
 ManyThe
 concluding
 part
 of
 our
 Lords
 message
 to
 the
 imprisoned
 Baptist
 in
 answer
 to
 the
 latters
 inquiry
 was
 Blessed
 is
 he
 whosoever
 is
 not
 offended
 in
 me
 In
 passing
 it
 may
 be
 well
 to
 observe
 that
 whatever
 of
 reproof
 or
 rebuke
 these
 words
 may
 connote
 the
 lesson
 was
 given
 in
 the
 gentlest
 way
 and
 in
 the
 form
 most
 easy
 to
 understand
 As
 Deems
 has
 written
 Instead
 of
 saying
 Woe
 to
 him
 who
 is
 offended
 in
 me
 He
 puts
 it
 in
 the
 softer
 way
 Blessed
 is
 he
 who
 is
 not
 offended
 In
 our
 English
 version
 of
 the
 Holy
 Bible
 the
 word
 offend
 and
 its
 cognates
 are
 used
 in
 place
 of
 several
 different
 expressions
 which
 occur
 in
 the
 original
 Greek
 Thus
 actual
 infractions
 of
 the
 law
 sin
 and
 wickedness
 in
 general
 are
 all
 called
 offenses
 and
 the
 perpetrators
 of
 such
 are
 guilty
 offenders
 who
 deserve
 punishment
 In
 other
 instances
 even
 the
 works
 of
 righteousness
 are
 construed
 as
 causes
 of
 offense
 to
 the
 wicked
 but
 this
 is
 so
 not
 because
 the
 good
 works
 were
 in
 any
 way
 offenses
 against
 law
 or
 right
 but
 because
 the
 lawbreaker
 takes
 offense
 thereat
 The
 convicted
 felon
 if
 unrepentant
 and
 still
 of
 evil
 mind
 is
 offended
 and
 angry
 at
 the
 law
 by
 which
 he
 has
 been
 brought
 to
 justice
 to
 him
 the
 law
 is
 a
 cause
 of
 offense
 In
 a
 very
 significant
 sense
 Jesus
 Christ
 stands
 as
 the
 greatest
 offender
 in
 history
 for
 all
 who
 reject
 His
 gospel
 take
 offense
 thereat
 On
 the
 night
 of
 His
 betrayal
 Jesus
 told
 the
 apostles
 that
 they
 would
 be
 offended
 because
 of
 Him
 Matt
 
 see
 also
 verse
 
 The
 Lords
 personal
 ministry
 gave
 offense
 not
 alone
 to
 Pharisees
 and
 priestly
 opponents
 but
 to
 many
 who
 had
 professed
 belief
 in
 Him
 John
 
 compare
 
 The
 gospel
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 is
 designated
 by
 Peter
 as
 a
 stone
 of
 stumbling
 and
 a
 rock
 of
 offense
 even
 to
 them
 which
 stumble
 at
 the
 word
 being
 disobedient
 
 Peter
 
 compare
 Pauls
 words
 Romans
 
 Indeed
 blessed
 is
 he
 to
 whom
 the
 gospel
 is
 welcome
 and
 who
 finds
 therein
 no
 cause
 for
 offense
 
 The
 Greatness
 of
 the
 Baptists
 MissionThe
 exalted
 nature
 of
 the
 mission
 of
 John
 the
 Baptist
 was
 thus
 testified
 to
 by
 Jesus
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Among
 them
 that
 are
 born
 of
 women
 there
 hath
 not
 risen
 a
 greater
 than
 John
 the
 Baptist
 notwithstanding
 he
 that
 is
 least
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 greater
 than
 he
 Matt
 
 compare
 Luke
 
 In
 elucidation
 of
 the
 first
 part
 of
 this
 testimony
 the
 prophet
 Joseph
 Smith
 said
 in
 the
 course
 of
 a
 sermon
 delivered
 May
 
 
 Hist
 of
 the
 Church
 under
 date
 named
 It
 could
 not
 have
 been
 on
 account
 of
 the
 miracles
 John
 performed
 for
 he
 did
 no
 miracles
 but
 it
 wasFirst
 because
 he
 was
 trusted
 with
 a
 divine
 mission
 of
 preparing
 the
 way
 before
 the
 face
 of
 the
 Lord
 Who
 was
 trusted
 with
 such
 a
 mission
 before
 or
 since
 No
 man
 Second
 he
 was
 trusted
 and
 it
 was
 required
 at
 his
 hands
 to
 baptise
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 Who
 ever
 did
 that
 Who
 ever
 had
 so
 great
 a
 privilege
 or
 glory
 Who
 ever
 led
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 into
 the
 waters
 of
 baptism
 beholding
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 descend
 upon
 Him
 in
 the
 sign
 of
 a
 dove
 No
 man
 Third
 John
 at
 that
 time
 was
 the
 only
 legal
 administrator
 holding
 the
 keys
 of
 power
 there
 was
 on
 earth
 The
 keys
 the
 kingdom
 the
 power
 the
 glory
 had
 departed
 from
 the
 Jews
 and
 John
 the
 son
 of
 Zacharias
 by
 the
 holy
 anointing
 and
 decree
 of
 heaven
 held
 the
 keys
 of
 power
 at
 that
 time
 The
 latter
 part
 of
 our
 Lords
 statementnotwithstanding
 he
 that
 is
 least
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 greater
 than
 he
 John
 has
 given
 rise
 to
 diverse
 interpretations
 and
 comment
 The
 true
 meaning
 may
 be
 that
 surpassingly
 great
 as
 was
 Johns
 distinction
 among
 the
 prophets
 he
 had
 not
 learned
 at
 the
 time
 of
 the
 incident
 under
 consideration
 the
 full
 purpose
 of
 the
 Messiahs
 mission
 and
 such
 he
 would
 surely
 have
 to
 learn
 before
 he
 became
 eligible
 for
 admission
 into
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 therefore
 the
 least
 of
 those
 who
 through
 knowledge
 gained
 and
 obedience
 rendered
 would
 be
 prepared
 for
 a
 place
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 which
 Jesus
 taught
 was
 greater
 than
 was
 John
 the
 Baptist
 at
 that
 time
 Through
 latterday
 inspiration
 we
 learn
 that
 it
 is
 impossible
 for
 a
 man
 to
 be
 saved
 in
 ignorance
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 and
 that
 The
 glory
 of
 God
 in
 intelligence
 or
 in
 other
 words
 light
 and
 truth
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 The
 Baptists
 inquiry
 showed
 that
 he
 was
 then
 lacking
 in
 knowledge
 imperfectly
 enlightened
 and
 unable
 to
 comprehend
 the
 whole
 truth
 of
 the
 Saviors
 appointed
 death
 and
 subsequent
 resurrection
 as
 the
 Redeemer
 of
 the
 world
 But
 we
 must
 not
 lose
 sight
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 Jesus
 in
 no
 wise
 intimated
 that
 John
 would
 remain
 less
 than
 the
 least
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 As
 he
 increased
 in
 knowledge
 of
 the
 vital
 truths
 of
 the
 kingdom
 and
 rendered
 obedience
 thereto
 he
 would
 surely
 advance
 and
 become
 great
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 as
 he
 was
 great
 among
 the
 prophets
 of
 earth
 
 John
 the
 Baptist
 the
 Elias
 that
 was
 to
 ComeIn
 the
 days
 of
 Christ
 the
 people
 clung
 to
 the
 traditional
 belief
 that
 the
 ancient
 prophet
 Elijah
 was
 to
 return
 in
 person
 Concerning
 this
 tradition
 the
 Dummelow
 Commentary
 says
 on
 Matt
 
 It
 was
 supposed
 that
 his
 Elijahs
 peculiar
 activity
 would
 consist
 in
 settling
 ceremonial
 and
 ritual
 questions
 doubts
 and
 difficulties
 and
 that
 he
 would
 restore
 to
 Israel
 
 the
 golden
 pot
 of
 manna
 
 the
 vessel
 containing
 the
 anointing
 oil
 
 the
 vessel
 containing
 the
 waters
 of
 purification
 
 Aarons
 rod
 that
 budded
 and
 bore
 fruit
 For
 this
 belief
 there
 was
 no
 scriptural
 affirmation
 That
 John
 was
 to
 go
 before
 the
 Messiah
 in
 the
 spirit
 and
 power
 of
 Elias
 was
 declared
 by
 the
 angel
 Gabriel
 in
 his
 announcement
 to
 Zacharias
 Luke
 
 and
 our
 Lord
 made
 plain
 the
 fact
 that
 John
 was
 that
 predicted
 Elias
 Elias
 is
 both
 a
 name
 and
 a
 title
 of
 office
 Through
 revelation
 in
 the
 present
 dispensation
 we
 learn
 of
 the
 separate
 individuality
 of
 Elias
 and
 Elijah
 each
 of
 whom
 appeared
 in
 person
 and
 committed
 to
 modern
 prophets
 the
 particular
 powers
 pertaining
 to
 his
 respective
 office
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 
 We
 learn
 that
 the
 office
 of
 Elias
 is
 that
 of
 restoration
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 
 
 
 
 Under
 date
 of
 March
 
 
 the
 following
 is
 recorded
 Hist
 of
 Church
 as
 the
 testimony
 of
 the
 prophet
 Joseph
 Smith
 The
 spirit
 of
 Elias
 is
 to
 prepare
 the
 way
 for
 a
 greater
 revelation
 of
 God
 which
 is
 the
 Priesthood
 of
 Elias
 or
 the
 Priesthood
 that
 Aaron
 was
 ordained
 unto
 And
 when
 God
 sends
 a
 man
 into
 the
 world
 to
 prepare
 for
 a
 greater
 work
 holding
 the
 keys
 of
 the
 power
 of
 Elias
 it
 was
 called
 the
 doctrine
 of
 Elias
 even
 from
 the
 early
 ages
 of
 the
 world
 Johns
 mission
 was
 limited
 to
 preaching
 and
 baptizing
 but
 what
 he
 did
 was
 legal
 and
 when
 Jesus
 Christ
 came
 to
 any
 of
 Johns
 disciples
 He
 baptized
 them
 with
 fire
 and
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 We
 find
 the
 apostles
 endowed
 with
 greater
 power
 than
 John
 their
 office
 was
 more
 under
 the
 spirit
 and
 power
 of
 Elijah
 than
 Elias
 In
 the
 case
 of
 Philip
 when
 he
 went
 down
 to
 Samaria
 when
 he
 was
 under
 the
 spirit
 of
 Elias
 he
 baptized
 both
 men
 and
 women
 When
 Peter
 and
 John
 heard
 of
 it
 they
 went
 down
 and
 laid
 hands
 upon
 them
 and
 they
 received
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 This
 shows
 the
 distinction
 between
 the
 two
 powers
 When
 Paul
 came
 to
 certain
 disciples
 he
 asked
 if
 they
 had
 received
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 They
 said
 No
 Who
 baptized
 you
 then
 We
 were
 baptized
 unto
 Johns
 baptism
 No
 you
 were
 not
 baptized
 unto
 Johns
 baptism
 or
 you
 would
 have
 been
 baptized
 by
 John
 And
 so
 Paul
 went
 and
 baptized
 them
 for
 he
 knew
 what
 the
 true
 doctrine
 was
 and
 he
 knew
 that
 John
 had
 not
 baptized
 them
 And
 these
 principles
 are
 strange
 to
 me
 that
 men
 who
 have
 read
 the
 Scriptures
 of
 the
 New
 Testament
 are
 so
 far
 from
 it
 What
 I
 want
 to
 impress
 upon
 your
 minds
 is
 the
 difference
 of
 power
 in
 the
 different
 parts
 of
 the
 Priesthood
 so
 that
 when
 any
 man
 comes
 among
 you
 saying
 I
 have
 the
 spirit
 of
 Elias
 you
 can
 know
 whether
 he
 be
 true
 or
 false
 for
 any
 man
 that
 comes
 having
 the
 spirit
 and
 power
 of
 Elias
 he
 will
 not
 transcend
 his
 bounds
 John
 did
 not
 transcend
 his
 bounds
 but
 faithfully
 performed
 that
 part
 belonging
 to
 his
 office
 and
 every
 portion
 of
 the
 great
 building
 should
 be
 prepared
 right
 and
 assigned
 to
 its
 proper
 place
 and
 it
 is
 necessary
 to
 know
 who
 holds
 the
 keys
 of
 power
 and
 who
 does
 not
 or
 we
 may
 be
 likely
 to
 be
 deceived
 That
 person
 who
 holds
 the
 keys
 of
 Elias
 hath
 a
 preparatory
 work
 
 
 
 
 
 This
 is
 the
 Elias
 spoken
 of
 in
 the
 last
 days
 and
 here
 is
 the
 rock
 upon
 which
 many
 split
 thinking
 the
 time
 was
 past
 in
 the
 days
 of
 John
 and
 Christ
 and
 no
 more
 to
 be
 But
 the
 spirit
 of
 Elias
 was
 revealed
 to
 me
 and
 I
 know
 it
 is
 true
 therefore
 I
 speak
 with
 boldness
 for
 I
 know
 verily
 my
 doctrine
 is
 true
 
 At
 the
 Pharisees
 TableThe
 expression
 sat
 at
 meat
 as
 in
 Luke
 
 and
 in
 other
 instances
 is
 stated
 by
 good
 authority
 to
 be
 a
 mistranslation
 it
 should
 be
 rendered
 lay
 or
 reclined
 see
 Smiths
 Comp
 Dict
 of
 the
 Bible
 article
 Meals
 That
 sitting
 was
 the
 early
 Hebrew
 posture
 at
 meals
 is
 not
 questioned
 Gen
 
 Judges
 
 
 Sam
 
 
 
 
 
 Kings
 
 but
 the
 custom
 of
 reclining
 on
 couches
 set
 around
 the
 table
 seems
 to
 date
 back
 long
 before
 the
 days
 of
 Jesus
 Amos
 
 
 The
 Roman
 usage
 of
 arranging
 the
 tables
 and
 adjoining
 couches
 along
 three
 sides
 of
 a
 square
 leaving
 the
 fourth
 side
 open
 for
 the
 passage
 of
 the
 attendants
 who
 served
 the
 diners
 was
 common
 in
 Palestine
 Tables
 and
 couches
 so
 placed
 constituted
 the
 triclinium
 In
 reference
 to
 the
 ceremonial
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 prescribed
 washing
 of
 articles
 used
 in
 eating
 Mark
 
 specifies
 tables
 this
 mention
 is
 conceded
 to
 be
 a
 mistranslation
 as
 couches
 or
 literally
 beds
 are
 meant
 by
 the
 Greek
 expression
 See
 marginal
 reading
 beds
 in
 Oxford
 Bible
 and
 others
 A
 person
 reclining
 at
 table
 would
 have
 the
 feet
 directed
 outward
 Thus
 it
 was
 a
 simple
 matter
 for
 the
 contrite
 woman
 to
 approach
 Jesus
 from
 behind
 and
 anoint
 His
 feet
 without
 causing
 disturbance
 to
 others
 at
 the
 table
 
 The
 Womans
 Identity
 not
 SpecifiedThe
 attempt
 to
 identify
 the
 contrite
 sinner
 who
 anointed
 the
 feet
 of
 Jesus
 in
 the
 house
 of
 Simon
 the
 Pharisee
 with
 Mary
 of
 Bethany
 is
 thus
 strongly
 condemned
 by
 Farrar
 p
 
 note
 Those
 who
 identify
 this
 feast
 at
 the
 house
 of
 Simon
 the
 Pharisee
 in
 Galilee
 with
 the
 longsubsequent
 feast
 at
 the
 house
 of
 Simon
 the
 leper
 at
 Bethany
 and
 the
 anointing
 of
 the
 feet
 by
 a
 woman
 that
 was
 a
 sinner
 in
 the
 city
 with
 the
 anointing
 of
 the
 head
 by
 Mary
 the
 sister
 of
 Martha
 adopt
 principles
 of
 criticism
 so
 reckless
 and
 arbitrary
 that
 their
 general
 acceptance
 would
 rob
 the
 Gospels
 of
 all
 credibility
 and
 make
 them
 hardly
 worth
 study
 as
 truthful
 narratives
 As
 for
 the
 names
 Simon
 and
 Judas
 which
 have
 led
 to
 so
 many
 identifications
 of
 different
 persons
 and
 different
 incidents
 they
 were
 at
 least
 as
 common
 among
 the
 Jews
 of
 that
 day
 as
 Smith
 and
 Jones
 among
 ourselves
 There
 are
 five
 or
 six
 Judes
 and
 nine
 Simons
 mentioned
 in
 the
 New
 Testament
 and
 two
 Judes
 and
 two
 Simons
 among
 the
 Apostles
 alone
 Josephus
 speaks
 of
 some
 ten
 Judes
 and
 twenty
 Simons
 in
 his
 writings
 and
 there
 must
 therefore
 have
 been
 thousands
 of
 others
 who
 at
 this
 period
 had
 one
 of
 these
 two
 names
 The
 incident
 of
 anointing
 with
 ointment
 is
 one
 quite
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 customs
 of
 the
 time
 and
 country
 and
 there
 is
 not
 the
 least
 improbability
 in
 its
 repetition
 under
 different
 circumstances
 Eccles
 
 Cant
 
 Amos
 
 The
 custom
 still
 continues
 The
 learned
 canon
 is
 fully
 justified
 in
 his
 vigorous
 criticism
 nevertheless
 he
 endorses
 the
 commonlyaccepted
 identification
 of
 the
 woman
 mentioned
 in
 connection
 with
 the
 meal
 in
 the
 house
 of
 Simon
 the
 Pharisee
 with
 Mary
 Magdalene
 although
 he
 admits
 that
 the
 foundation
 of
 the
 assumed
 identification
 is
 an
 ancient
 traditionespecially
 prevalent
 in
 the
 Western
 Church
 and
 followed
 by
 the
 translation
 of
 our
 English
 version
 p
 
 As
 stated
 in
 our
 text
 there
 is
 an
 entire
 absence
 of
 trustworthy
 evidence
 that
 Mary
 Magdalene
 was
 ever
 tainted
 with
 the
 sin
 for
 which
 the
 repentant
 woman
 in
 the
 Pharisees
 house
 was
 so
 graciously
 pardoned
 by
 our
 Lord
 
 The
 Unpardonable
 SinThe
 nature
 of
 the
 awful
 sin
 against
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 against
 which
 the
 Lord
 warned
 the
 Pharisaic
 accusers
 who
 sought
 to
 ascribe
 His
 divine
 power
 to
 Satan
 is
 more
 fully
 explained
 and
 its
 dread
 results
 are
 more
 explicitly
 set
 forth
 in
 modern
 revelation
 Concerning
 them
 and
 their
 dreadful
 fate
 the
 Almighty
 has
 saidI
 say
 that
 it
 had
 been
 better
 for
 them
 never
 to
 have
 been
 born
 for
 they
 are
 vessels
 of
 wrath
 doomed
 to
 suffer
 the
 wrath
 of
 God
 with
 the
 devil
 and
 his
 angels
 in
 eternity
 concerning
 whom
 I
 have
 said
 there
 is
 no
 forgiveness
 in
 this
 world
 nor
 in
 the
 world
 to
 come
 They
 shall
 go
 away
 into
 everlasting
 punishment
 which
 is
 endless
 punishment
 which
 is
 eternal
 punishment
 to
 reign
 with
 the
 devil
 and
 his
 angels
 in
 eternity
 where
 their
 worm
 dieth
 not
 and
 the
 fire
 is
 not
 quenched
 which
 is
 their
 torment
 and
 the
 end
 thereof
 neither
 the
 place
 thereof
 nor
 their
 torment
 no
 man
 knows
 neither
 was
 it
 revealed
 neither
 is
 neither
 will
 be
 revealed
 unto
 man
 except
 to
 them
 who
 are
 made
 partakers
 thereof
 nevertheless
 I
 the
 Lord
 show
 it
 by
 vision
 unto
 many
 but
 straightway
 shut
 it
 up
 again
 wherefore
 the
 end
 the
 width
 the
 height
 the
 depth
 and
 the
 misery
 thereof
 they
 understand
 not

 them
 who
 are
 ordained

 this
 condemnation

 An
 Adulterous
 Generation
 Seeking
 after
 SignsOur
 Lords
 reply
 to
 those
 who
 clamored
 for
 a
 sign
 that
 An
 evil
 and
 adulterous
 generation
 seeketh
 after
 a
 sign
 Matt
 
 see
 also
 
 Mark
 
 could
 only
 be
 interpreted
 by
 the
 Jews
 as
 a
 supreme
 reproof
 That
 the
 descriptive
 designation
 adulterous
 was
 literally
 applicable
 to
 the
 widespread
 immorality
 of
 the
 time
 they
 all
 knew
 Adam
 Clarke
 in
 his
 commentary
 on
 Matt
 
 says
 of
 this
 phase
 of
 our
 topic
 There
 is
 the
 utmost
 proof
 from
 their
 the
 Jews
 own
 writings
 that
 in
 the
 time
 of
 our
 Lord
 they
 were
 most
 literally
 an
 adulterous
 race
 of
 people
 for
 at
 this
 very
 time
 Rabbi
 Jachanan
 ben
 Zacchi
 abrogated
 the
 trial
 by
 the
 bitter
 waters
 of
 jealousy
 because
 so
 many
 were
 found
 to
 be
 thus
 criminal
 For
 the
 information
 concerning
 the
 trial
 of
 the
 accused
 by
 the
 bitter
 waters
 see
 Numb
 
 Although
 Jesus
 designated
 the
 generation
 in
 which
 He
 lived
 as
 adulterous
 we
 find
 no
 record
 that
 the
 Jewish
 rulers
 who
 by
 their
 demand
 for
 a
 sign
 had
 given
 occasion
 for
 the
 accusation
 ventured
 to
 deny
 or
 attempt
 to
 repel
 the
 charge
 The
 sin
 of
 adultery
 was
 included
 among
 capital
 offenses
 Deut
 
 The
 severity
 of
 the
 accusation
 as
 applied
 by
 Jesus
 however
 was
 intensified
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 older
 scriptures
 represented
 the
 covenant
 between
 Jehovah
 and
 Israel
 as
 a
 marriage
 bond
 Isa
 
 Jer
 
 
 Hos
 
 
 even
 as
 the
 later
 scriptures
 typify
 the
 Church
 as
 a
 bride
 and
 Christ
 as
 the
 husband
 
 Cor
 
 compare
 Rev
 
 To
 be
 spiritually
 adulterous
 as
 the
 rabbis
 construed
 the
 utterances
 of
 the
 prophets
 was
 to
 be
 false
 to
 the
 covenant
 by
 which
 the
 Jewish
 nations
 claimed
 distinction
 as
 the
 worshipers
 of
 Jehovah
 and
 to
 be
 wholly
 recreant
 and
 reprobate
 Convicted
 on
 such
 a
 charge
 those
 signseeking
 Pharisees
 and
 scribes
 understood
 that
 Jesus
 classed
 them
 as
 worse
 than
 the
 idolatrous
 heathen
 The
 words
 adultery
 and
 idolatry
 are
 of
 related
 origin
 each
 connoting
 the
 act
 of
 unfaithfulness
 and
 the
 turning
 away
 after
 false
 objects
 of
 affection
 or
 worship
 
 The
 Mother
 and
 the
 Brethren
 of
 JesusThe
 attempt
 of
 Mary
 and
 some
 members
 of
 her
 family
 to
 speak
 with
 Jesus
 on
 the
 occasion
 referred
 to
 in
 the
 text
 has
 been
 construed
 by
 many
 writers
 to
 mean
 that
 the
 mother
 and
 sons
 had
 come
 to
 protest
 against
 the
 energy
 and
 zeal
 with
 which
 Jesus
 was
 pursuing
 His
 work
 Some
 indeed
 have
 gone
 so
 far
 as
 to
 say
 that
 the
 visiting
 members
 of
 the
 family
 had
 come
 to
 put
 Him
 under
 restraint
 and
 to
 stem
 if
 they
 could
 the
 tide
 of
 popular
 interest
 criticism
 and
 offense
 which
 surged
 about
 Him
 The
 scriptural
 record
 furnishes
 no
 foundation
 for
 even
 a
 tentative
 conception
 of
 the
 kind
 The
 purpose
 of
 the
 desired
 visit
 is
 not
 intimated
 It
 is
 a
 fact
 as
 will
 be
 shown
 in
 pages
 to
 follow
 that
 some
 members
 of
 Marys
 household
 had
 failed
 to
 understand
 the
 great
 import
 of
 the
 work
 in
 which
 Jesus
 was
 so
 assiduously
 engaged
 and
 we
 are
 told
 that
 some
 of
 His
 friends
 marginal
 rendering
 kinsmen
 on
 one
 occasion
 set
 out
 with
 the
 purpose
 of
 laying
 hold
 on
 Him
 and
 stopping
 His
 public
 activities
 by
 physical
 force
 for
 they
 said
 He
 is
 beside
 himself
 Mark
 
 furthermore
 we
 learn
 that
 His
 brethren
 did
 not
 believe
 on
 Him
 John
 
 These
 facts
 however
 scarcely
 warrant
 the
 assumption
 that
 the
 desire
 of
 Mary
 and
 her
 sons
 to
 speak
 with
 Him
 on
 the
 occasion
 referred
 to
 was
 other
 than
 peaceful
 And
 to
 assume
 that
 Mary
 His
 mother
 had
 so
 far
 forgotten
 the
 wondrous
 scenes
 of
 the
 angelic
 annunciation
 the
 miraculous
 conception
 the
 heavenly
 accompaniments
 of
 the
 birth
 the
 more
 than
 human
 wisdom
 and
 power
 exhibited
 in
 youth
 and
 manhood
 as
 to
 believe
 her
 divine
 Son
 an
 unbalanced
 enthusiast
 whom
 she
 ought
 to
 restrain
 is
 to
 assume
 responsibility
 for
 injustice
 to
 the
 character
 of
 one
 whom
 the
 angel
 Gabriel
 declared
 was
 blessed
 among
 women
 and
 highly
 favored
 of
 the
 Lord
 The
 statement
 that
 the
 brethren
 of
 Jesus
 did
 not
 believe
 on
 Him
 at
 the
 time
 referred
 to
 by
 the
 recorder
 John
 
 is
 no
 proof
 that
 some
 or
 even
 all
 of
 those
 same
 brethren
 did
 not
 later
 believe
 on
 their
 divine
 Brother
 Immediately
 after
 the
 Lords
 ascension
 Mary
 the
 mother
 of
 Jesus
 and
 His
 brethren
 were
 engaged
 in
 worship
 and
 supplication
 with
 the
 Eleven
 and
 other
 disciples
 Acts
 
 The
 attested
 fact
 of
 Christs
 resurrection
 converted
 many
 who
 had
 before
 declined
 to
 accept
 Him
 as
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 Paul
 records
 a
 special
 manifestation
 of
 the
 resurrected
 Christ
 to
 James
 
 Cor
 
 and
 the
 James
 here
 referred
 to
 may
 be
 the
 same
 person
 elsewhere
 designated
 as
 the
 Lords
 brother
 Gal
 
 compare
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 It
 appears
 that
 brethren
 of
 the
 Lord
 were
 engaged
 in
 the
 work
 of
 the
 ministry
 in
 the
 days
 of
 Pauls
 active
 service
 
 Cor
 
 The
 specific
 family
 relationship
 of
 our
 Lord
 to
 James
 Joses
 Simon
 Judas
 and
 the
 sisters
 referred
 to
 by
 Matthew
 
 
 and
 Mark
 
 has
 been
 questioned
 and
 several
 theories
 have
 been
 invented
 in
 support
 of
 divergent
 views
 Thus
 the
 Eastern
 or
 Epiphanian
 hypothesis
 holds
 on
 no
 firmer
 basis
 than
 assumption
 that
 the
 brethren
 of
 Jesus
 were
 children
 of
 Joseph
 of
 Nazareth
 by
 a
 former
 wife
 and
 not
 the
 children
 of
 Mary
 the
 Lords
 mother
 The
 Levirate
 theory
 assumes
 that
 Joseph
 of
 Nazareth
 and
 Clopas
 the
 latter
 name
 it
 is
 interesting
 to
 note
 is
 regarded
 as
 the
 equivalent
 of
 Alpheus
 see
 footnote
 page
 
 were
 brothers
 and
 that
 after
 the
 death
 of
 Clopas
 or
 Alpheus
 Joseph
 married
 his
 brothers
 widow
 according
 to
 the
 levirate
 law
 page
 
 The
 Hieronymian
 hypothesis
 is
 based
 on
 the
 belief
 that
 the
 persons
 referred
 to
 as
 brethren
 and
 sisters
 of
 Jesus
 were
 children
 of
 Clopas
 Alpheus
 and
 Mary
 the
 sister
 of
 the
 Lords
 mother
 and
 therefore
 cousins
 to
 Jesus
 See
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 John
 
 It
 is
 beyond
 reasonable
 doubt
 that
 Jesus
 was
 regarded
 by
 those
 who
 were
 acquainted
 with
 the
 family
 of
 Joseph
 and
 Mary
 as
 a
 close
 blood
 relative
 of
 other
 sons
 and
 daughters
 belonging
 to
 the
 household
 If
 these
 others
 were
 children
 of
 Joseph
 and
 Mary
 they
 were
 all
 juniors
 to
 Jesus
 for
 He
 was
 undoubtedly
 His
 mothers
 firstborn
 child
 The
 acceptance
 of
 this
 relationship
 between
 Jesus
 and
 His
 brethren
 and
 sisters
 mentioned
 by
 the
 synoptists
 constitutes
 what
 is
 known
 in
 theological
 literature
 as
 the
 Helvidian
 view

 CHAPTER
 
 HE
 SPAKE
 MANY
 THINGS
 UNTO
 THEM
 IN
 PARABLES
 Throughout
 the
 period
 of
 Christs
 ministry
 with
 which
 we
 have
 thus
 far
 dealt
 His
 fame
 had
 continuously
 increased
 because
 of
 the
 authority
 with
 which
 He
 spoke
 and
 of
 the
 many
 mighty
 works
 He
 did
 His
 popularity
 had
 become
 such
 that
 whenever
 He
 moved
 abroad
 great
 multitudes
 followed
 Him
 At
 times
 the
 people
 so
 thronged
 as
 to
 impede
 His
 movements
 some
 with
 a
 desire
 to
 hear
 more
 of
 the
 new
 doctrine
 others
 to
 plead
 at
 His
 feet
 for
 relief
 from
 physical
 or
 other
 ills
 and
 many
 there
 were
 who
 had
 faith
 that
 could
 they
 but
 reach
 Him
 or
 even
 touch
 the
 border
 of
 His
 robe
 they
 would
 be
 healed
 One
 effect
 of
 the
 peoples
 eagerness
 which
 led
 them
 to
 press
 and
 crowd
 around
 Him
 was
 to
 render
 difficult
 if
 not
 impossible
 at
 times
 the
 effective
 delivery
 of
 any
 discourse
 His
 usual
 place
 for
 openair
 teaching
 while
 He
 tarried
 in
 the
 vicinity
 of
 the
 sea
 or
 lake
 of
 Galilee
 was
 the
 shore
 and
 thither
 flocked
 the
 crowds
 to
 hear
 Him
 At
 His
 request
 the
 disciples
 had
 provided
 a
 small
 ship
 which
 was
 kept
 in
 readiness
 on
 the
 beach
 and
 it
 was
 usual
 with
 Him
 to
 sit
 in
 the
 boat
 a
 short
 distance
 off
 shore
 and
 preach
 to
 the
 people
 as
 He
 had
 done
 when
 in
 the
 earlier
 days
 He
 called
 the
 chosen
 fishermen
 to
 leave
 their
 nets
 and
 follow
 Him
 On
 one
 such
 occasion
 He
 employed
 a
 means
 of
 instruction
 which
 prior
 to
 that
 time
 had
 not
 been
 characteristic
 of
 His
 teaching
 this
 consisted
 in
 the
 use
 of
 parables
 simple
 stories
 to
 illustrate
 His
 doctrines
 Some
 of
 these
 we
 shall
 here
 consider
 briefly
 in
 the
 order
 most
 advantageous
 for
 treatment
 and
 as
 best
 we
 know
 in
 what
 may
 have
 been
 the
 sequence
 in
 which
 they
 were
 given
 A
 SOWER
 WENT
 FORTH
 TO
 SOW
 First
 in
 the
 order
 of
 delivery
 is
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Sower
 It
 is
 a
 splendid
 type
 of
 our
 Lords
 parables
 in
 general
 and
 is
 particularly
 valuable
 for
 its
 great
 intrinsic
 worth
 and
 because
 we
 possess
 a
 comprehensive
 interpretation
 of
 it
 by
 the
 divine
 Author
 This
 is
 the
 story
 Behold
 a
 sower
 went
 forth
 to
 sow
 and
 when
 he
 sowed
 some
 seeds
 fell
 by
 the
 way
 side
 and
 the
 fowls
 came
 and
 devoured
 them
 up
 some
 fell
 upon
 stony
 places
 where
 they
 had
 not
 much
 earth
 and
 forthwith
 they
 sprung
 up
 because
 they
 had
 no
 deepness
 of
 earth
 and
 when
 the
 sun
 was
 up
 they
 were
 scorched
 and
 because
 they
 had
 no
 root
 they
 withered
 away
 And
 some
 fell
 among
 thorns
 and
 the
 thorns
 sprung
 up
 and
 choked
 them
 but
 other
 fell
 into
 good
 ground
 and
 brought
 forth
 fruit
 some
 an
 hundredfold
 some
 sixtyfold
 some
 thirtyfold
 Who
 hath
 ears
 to
 hear
 let
 him
 hear
 This
 new
 way
 of
 teaching
 this
 departure
 from
 the
 Masters
 earlier
 method
 of
 doctrinal
 exposition
 caused
 even
 the
 most
 devoted
 of
 the
 disciples
 to
 marvel
 The
 Twelve
 and
 a
 few
 others
 came
 to
 Jesus
 when
 He
 was
 apart
 from
 the
 multitude
 and
 asked
 why
 He
 had
 spoken
 to
 the
 people
 in
 this
 manner
 and
 what
 was
 the
 meaning
 of
 this
 particular
 parable
 Our
 Lords
 reply
 to
 the
 first
 part
 of
 the
 inquiry
 we
 shall
 consider
 presently
 concerning
 the
 second
 He
 asked
 Know
 ye
 not
 the
 parable
 and
 how
 then
 will
 ye
 know
 all
 parables
 Thus
 did
 He
 indicate
 the
 simplicity
 of
 this
 the
 first
 of
 His
 parables
 together
 with
 its
 typical
 and
 fundamental
 character
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 intimate
 that
 other
 parables
 would
 follow
 in
 the
 course
 of
 His
 teaching
 Then
 He
 gave
 the
 interpretation
 Hear
 ye
 therefore
 the
 parable
 of
 the
 sower
 When
 anyone
 heareth
 the
 word
 of
 the
 kingdom
 and
 understandeth
 it
 not
 then
 cometh
 the
 wicked
 one
 and
 catcheth
 away
 that
 which
 was
 sown
 in
 his
 heart
 This
 is
 he
 which
 received
 seed
 by
 the
 way
 side
 But
 he
 that
 received
 the
 seed
 into
 stony
 places
 the
 same
 is
 he
 that
 heareth
 the
 word
 and
 anon
 with
 joy
 receiveth
 it
 yet
 hath
 he
 not
 root
 in
 himself
 but
 dureth
 for
 a
 while
 for
 when
 tribulation
 or
 persecution
 ariseth
 because
 of
 the
 word
 by
 and
 by
 he
 is
 offended
 He
 also
 that
 received
 seed
 among
 the
 thorns
 is
 he
 that
 heareth
 the
 word
 and
 the
 care
 of
 this
 world
 and
 the
 deceitfulness
 of
 riches
 choke
 the
 word
 and
 he
 becometh
 unfruitful
 But
 he
 that
 received
 seed
 into
 the
 good
 ground
 is
 he
 that
 heareth
 the
 word
 and
 understandeth
 it
 which
 also
 beareth
 fruit
 and
 bringeth
 forth
 some
 an
 hundredfold
 some
 sixty
 some
 thirty
 Further
 exposition
 may
 appear
 superfluous
 some
 suggestion
 as
 to
 the
 individual
 application
 of
 the
 contained
 lessons
 may
 be
 in
 place
 however
 Observe
 that
 the
 prominent
 feature
 of
 the
 story
 is
 that
 of
 the
 prepared
 or
 unprepared
 condition
 of
 the
 soil
 The
 seed
 was
 the
 same
 whether
 it
 fell
 on
 good
 ground
 or
 bad
 on
 mellow
 mold
 or
 among
 stones
 and
 thistles
 The
 primitive
 method
 of
 sowing
 still
 followed
 in
 many
 countries
 consists
 in
 the
 sower
 throwing
 the
 grain
 by
 handfuls
 against
 the
 wind
 thus
 securing
 a
 widespread
 scattering
 Running
 through
 the
 Galilean
 fields
 were
 pathways
 hard
 trodden
 by
 feet
 of
 men
 and
 beasts
 Though
 seed
 should
 fall
 on
 such
 tracts
 it
 could
 not
 grow
 birds
 would
 pick
 up
 the
 living
 kernels
 lying
 unrooted
 and
 uncovered
 and
 some
 of
 the
 grains
 would
 be
 crushed
 and
 trodden
 down
 So
 with
 the
 seed
 of
 truth
 falling
 upon
 the
 hardened
 heart
 ordinarily
 it
 cannot
 take
 root
 and
 Satan
 as
 a
 marauding
 crow
 steals
 it
 away
 lest
 a
 grain
 of
 it
 perchance
 find
 a
 crack
 in
 the
 trampled
 ground
 send
 down
 its
 rootlet
 and
 possibly
 develop
 Seed
 falling
 in
 shallow
 soil
 underlain
 by
 a
 floor
 of
 unbroken
 stone
 or
 hardpan
 may
 strike
 root
 and
 flourish
 for
 a
 brief
 season
 but
 as
 the
 descending
 rootlets
 reach
 the
 impenetrable
 stratum
 they
 shrivel
 and
 the
 plant
 withers
 and
 dies
 for
 the
 nutritive
 juices
 are
 insufficient
 where
 there
 is
 no
 depth
 of
 earth
 So
 with
 the
 man
 whose
 earnestness
 is
 but
 superficial
 whose
 energy
 ceases
 when
 obstacles
 are
 encountered
 or
 opposition
 met
 though
 he
 manifest
 enthusiasm
 for
 a
 time
 persecution
 deters
 him
 he
 is
 offended
 and
 endures
 not
 Grain
 sown
 where
 thorns
 and
 thistles
 abound
 is
 soon
 killed
 out
 by
 their
 smothering
 growth
 even
 so
 with
 a
 human
 heart
 set
 on
 riches
 and
 the
 allurements
 of
 pleasurethough
 it
 receive
 the
 living
 seed
 of
 the
 gospel
 it
 will
 produce
 no
 harvest
 of
 good
 grain
 but
 instead
 a
 rank
 tangle
 of
 noxious
 weeds
 The
 abundant
 yield
 of
 thorny
 thistles
 demonstrates
 the
 fitness
 of
 the
 soil
 for
 a
 better
 crop
 were
 it
 only
 free
 from
 the
 cumbering
 weeds
 The
 seed
 that
 falls
 in
 good
 deep
 soil
 free
 from
 weeds
 and
 prepared
 for
 the
 sowing
 strikes
 root
 and
 grows
 the
 suns
 heat
 scorches
 it
 not
 but
 gives
 it
 thrift
 it
 matures
 and
 yields
 to
 the
 harvester
 according
 to
 the
 richness
 of
 the
 soil
 some
 fields
 producing
 thirty
 others
 sixty
 and
 a
 few
 even
 a
 hundred
 times
 as
 much
 grain
 as
 was
 sown
 Even
 according
 to
 literary
 canons
 and
 as
 judged
 by
 the
 recognized
 standards
 of
 rhetorical
 construction
 and
 logical
 arrangement
 of
 its
 parts
 this
 parable
 holds
 first
 place
 among
 productions
 of
 its
 class
 Though
 commonly
 known
 to
 us
 as
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Sower
 the
 story
 could
 be
 expressively
 designated
 as
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Four
 Kinds
 of
 Soil
 It
 is
 the
 ground
 upon
 which
 the
 seed
 is
 cast
 to
 which
 the
 story
 most
 strongly
 directs
 our
 attention
 and
 which
 so
 aptly
 is
 made
 to
 symbolize
 the
 softened
 or
 the
 hardened
 heart
 the
 clean
 or
 the
 thorninfested
 soil
 Observe
 the
 grades
 of
 soil
 given
 in
 the
 increasing
 order
 of
 their
 fertility
 A
 the
 compacted
 highway
 the
 wayside
 path
 on
 which
 save
 by
 a
 combination
 of
 fortuitous
 circumstances
 practically
 amounting
 to
 a
 miracle
 no
 seed
 can
 possibly
 strike
 root
 or
 grow
 B
 the
 thin
 layer
 of
 soil
 covering
 an
 impenetrable
 bedrock
 wherein
 seed
 may
 sprout
 yet
 can
 never
 mature
 C
 the
 weedencumbered
 field
 capable
 of
 producing
 a
 rich
 crop
 but
 for
 the
 jungle
 of
 thistles
 and
 thorns
 and
 D
 the
 clean
 rich
 mold
 receptive
 and
 fertile
 Yet
 even
 soils
 classed
 as
 good
 are
 of
 varying
 degrees
 of
 productiveness
 yielding
 an
 increase
 of
 thirty
 sixty
 or
 even
 a
 hundred
 fold
 with
 many
 intergradations
 Some
 Bible
 expositors
 have
 professed
 to
 find
 in
 this
 splendid
 parable
 evidence
 of
 decisive
 fatalism
 in
 the
 lives
 of
 individuals
 so
 that
 those
 whose
 spiritual
 state
 is
 comparable
 to
 the
 hardened
 pathway
 or
 wayside
 ground
 to
 the
 shallow
 soil
 on
 stony
 floor
 or
 to
 the
 neglected
 thornridden
 tract
 are
 hopelessly
 and
 irredeemably
 bad
 while
 the
 souls
 who
 may
 be
 likened
 unto
 good
 soil
 are
 safe
 against
 deterioration
 and
 will
 be
 inevitably
 productive
 of
 good
 fruit
 Let
 it
 not
 be
 forgotten
 that
 a
 parable
 is
 but
 a
 sketch
 not
 a
 picture
 finished
 in
 detail
 and
 that
 the
 expressed
 or
 implied
 similitude
 in
 parabolic
 teaching
 cannot
 logically
 and
 consistently
 be
 carried
 beyond
 the
 limits
 of
 the
 illustrative
 story
 In
 the
 parable
 we
 are
 considering
 the
 Teacher
 depicted
 the
 varied
 grades
 of
 spiritual
 receptivity
 existing
 among
 men
 and
 characterized
 with
 incisive
 brevity
 each
 of
 the
 specified
 grades
 He
 neither
 said
 nor
 intimated
 that
 the
 hardbaked
 soil
 of
 the
 wayside
 might
 be
 plowed
 harrowed
 fertilized
 and
 so
 be
 rendered
 productive
 nor
 that
 the
 stony
 impediment
 to
 growth
 might
 not
 be
 broken
 up
 and
 removed
 or
 an
 increase
 of
 good
 soil
 be
 made
 by
 actual
 addition
 nor
 that
 the
 thorns
 could
 never
 be
 uprooted
 and
 their
 former
 habitat
 be
 rendered
 fit
 to
 support
 good
 plants
 The
 parable
 is
 to
 be
 studied
 in
 the
 spirit
 of
 its
 purpose
 and
 strained
 inferences
 or
 extensions
 are
 unwarranted
 A
 strong
 metaphor
 a
 striking
 simile
 or
 any
 other
 expressive
 figure
 of
 speech
 is
 of
 service
 only
 when
 rationally
 applied
 if
 carried
 beyond
 the
 bounds
 of
 reasonable
 intent
 the
 best
 of
 such
 may
 become
 meaningless
 or
 even
 absurd
 THE
 WHEAT
 AND
 THE
 TARES
 Another
 parable
 somewhat
 closely
 related
 to
 the
 foregoing
 as
 to
 the
 actual
 story
 dealing
 again
 with
 seed
 and
 sowing
 and
 like
 the
 first
 accompanied
 by
 an
 interpretation
 was
 delivered
 by
 the
 Master
 as
 follows
 The
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 likened
 unto
 a
 man
 which
 sowed
 good
 seed
 in
 his
 field
 but
 while
 men
 slept
 his
 enemy
 came
 and
 sowed
 tares
 among
 the
 wheat
 and
 went
 his
 way
 But
 when
 the
 blade
 was
 sprung
 up
 and
 brought
 forth
 fruit
 then
 appeared
 the
 tares
 also
 So
 the
 servants
 of
 the
 householder
 came
 and
 said
 unto
 him
 Sir
 didst
 not
 thou
 sow
 good
 seed
 in
 thy
 field
 from
 whence
 then
 hath
 it
 tares
 He
 said
 unto
 them
 An
 enemy
 hath
 done
 this
 The
 servants
 said
 unto
 him
 Wilt
 thou
 then
 that
 we
 go
 and
 gather
 them
 up
 But
 he
 said
 Nay
 lest
 while
 ye
 gather
 up
 the
 tares
 ye
 root
 up
 also
 the
 wheat
 with
 them
 Let
 both
 grow
 together
 until
 the
 harvest
 and
 in
 the
 time
 of
 harvest
 I
 will
 say
 to
 the
 reapers
 Gather
 ye
 together
 first
 the
 tares
 and
 bind
 them
 in
 bundles
 to
 burn
 them
 but
 gather
 the
 wheat
 into
 my
 barn
 When
 Jesus
 had
 retired
 to
 the
 house
 in
 which
 He
 lodged
 the
 disciples
 came
 saying
 Declare
 unto
 us
 the
 parable
 of
 the
 tares
 of
 the
 field
 He
 answered
 and
 said
 unto
 them
 He
 that
 soweth
 the
 good
 seed
 is
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 the
 field
 is
 the
 world
 the
 good
 seed
 are
 the
 children
 of
 the
 kingdom
 but
 the
 tares
 are
 the
 children
 of
 the
 wicked
 one
 the
 enemy
 that
 sowed
 them
 is
 the
 devil
 the
 harvest
 is
 the
 end
 of
 the
 world
 and
 the
 reapers
 are
 the
 angels
 As
 therefore
 the
 tares
 are
 gathered
 and
 burned
 in
 the
 fire
 so
 shall
 it
 be
 in
 the
 end
 of
 this
 world
 The
 Son
 of
 man
 shall
 send
 forth
 his
 angels
 and
 they
 shall
 gather
 out
 of
 his
 kingdom
 all
 things
 that
 offend
 and
 them
 which
 do
 iniquity
 and
 shall
 cast
 them
 into
 a
 furnace
 of
 fire
 there
 shall
 be
 wailing
 and
 gnashing
 of
 teeth
 Then
 shall
 the
 righteous
 shine
 forth
 as
 the
 sun
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 their
 Father
 Who
 hath
 ears
 to
 hear
 let
 him
 hear
 By
 the
 Authors
 explication
 the
 sower
 was
 Himself
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 and
 as
 the
 condition
 of
 wheat
 and
 tares
 growing
 together
 was
 one
 that
 shall
 continue
 until
 the
 end
 of
 the
 world
 those
 who
 were
 ordained
 to
 carry
 on
 the
 ministry
 after
 Him
 are
 by
 direct
 implication
 also
 sowers
 The
 seed
 as
 here
 represented
 is
 not
 as
 in
 the
 last
 parable
 the
 gospel
 itself
 but
 the
 children
 of
 men
 the
 good
 seed
 typifying
 the
 honest
 in
 heart
 righteousminded
 children
 of
 the
 kingdom
 while
 the
 tares
 are
 those
 souls
 who
 have
 given
 themselves
 up
 to
 evil
 and
 are
 counted
 as
 children
 of
 the
 wicked
 one
 Inspired
 by
 zeal
 for
 their
 Masters
 profit
 the
 servants
 would
 have
 forcibly
 rooted
 up
 the
 tares
 but
 were
 restrained
 for
 their
 unwise
 though
 wellintended
 course
 would
 have
 endangered
 the
 wheat
 while
 yet
 tender
 since
 in
 the
 early
 stages
 of
 growth
 it
 would
 have
 been
 difficult
 to
 distinguish
 the
 one
 from
 the
 other
 and
 the
 intertwining
 of
 the
 roots
 would
 have
 caused
 much
 destruction
 of
 the
 precious
 grain
 One
 cardinal
 lesson
 of
 the
 parable
 apart
 from
 the
 representation
 of
 actual
 conditions
 present
 and
 future
 is
 that
 of
 patience
 longsuffering
 and
 tolerationeach
 an
 attribute
 of
 Deity
 and
 a
 trait
 of
 character
 that
 all
 men
 should
 cultivate
 The
 tares
 mentioned
 in
 the
 story
 may
 be
 considered
 as
 any
 kind
 of
 noxious
 weed
 particularly
 such
 as
 in
 early
 growth
 resembles
 the
 wholesome
 grain
 Oversowing
 with
 the
 seed
 of
 weeds
 in
 a
 field
 already
 sown
 with
 grain
 is
 a
 species
 of
 malignant
 outrage
 not
 unknown
 even
 in
 the
 present
 day
 The
 certainty
 of
 a
 time
 of
 separation
 when
 the
 wheat
 shall
 be
 garnered
 in
 the
 storehouse
 of
 the
 Lord
 and
 the
 tares
 be
 burned
 that
 their
 poisonous
 seed
 may
 reproduce
 no
 more
 is
 placed
 beyond
 question
 by
 the
 Lords
 own
 exposition
 So
 important
 is
 the
 lesson
 embodied
 in
 this
 parable
 and
 so
 assured
 is
 the
 literal
 fulfilment
 of
 its
 contained
 predictions
 that
 the
 Lord
 has
 given
 a
 further
 explication
 through
 revelation
 in
 the
 current
 dispensation
 a
 period
 in
 which
 the
 application
 is
 direct
 and
 immediate
 Speaking
 through
 Joseph
 Smith
 the
 Prophet
 in
 
 Jesus
 Christ
 said
 But
 behold
 in
 the
 last
 days
 even
 now
 while
 the
 Lord
 is
 beginning
 to
 bring
 forth
 the
 word
 and
 the
 blade
 is
 springing
 up
 and
 is
 yet
 tender
 Behold
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 the
 angels
 are
 crying
 unto
 the
 Lord
 day
 and
 night
 who
 are
 ready
 and
 waiting
 to
 be
 sent
 forth
 to
 reap
 down
 the
 fields
 but
 the
 Lord
 saith
 unto
 them
 pluck
 not
 up
 the
 tares
 while
 the
 blade
 is
 yet
 tender
 for
 verily
 your
 faith
 is
 weak
 lest
 you
 destroy
 the
 wheat
 also
 Therefore
 let
 the
 wheat
 and
 the
 tares
 grow
 together
 until
 the
 harvest
 is
 fully
 ripe
 then
 ye
 shall
 first
 gather
 out
 the
 wheat
 from
 among
 the
 tares
 and
 after
 the
 gathering
 of
 the
 wheat
 behold
 and
 lo
 the
 tares
 are
 bound
 in
 bundles
 and
 the
 field
 remaineth
 to
 be
 burned
 THE
 SEED
 GROWING
 SECRETLY
 Matthew
 records
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Tares
 as
 immediately
 following
 that
 of
 the
 Sower
 Mark
 places
 in
 the
 same
 position
 of
 sequence
 a
 parable
 found
 in
 his
 writings
 alone
 It
 is
 presented
 in
 outline
 form
 and
 by
 critical
 expositors
 would
 be
 classed
 rather
 as
 a
 simple
 analogy
 than
 a
 typical
 parable
 Read
 it
 And
 he
 said
 So
 is
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 as
 if
 a
 man
 should
 cast
 seed
 into
 the
 ground
 and
 should
 sleep
 and
 rise
 night
 and
 day
 and
 the
 seed
 should
 spring
 and
 grow
 up
 he
 knoweth
 not
 how
 For
 the
 earth
 bringeth
 forth
 fruit
 of
 herself
 first
 the
 blade
 then
 the
 ear
 after
 that
 the
 full
 corn
 in
 the
 ear
 But
 when
 the
 fruit
 is
 brought
 forth
 immediately
 he
 putteth
 in
 the
 sickle
 because
 the
 harvest
 is
 come
 We
 have
 no
 record
 of
 the
 disciples
 asking
 nor
 of
 the
 Master
 giving
 any
 interpretation
 of
 this
 or
 of
 any
 later
 parable
 In
 this
 story
 we
 find
 effectively
 illustrated
 the
 fact
 of
 the
 vitality
 of
 the
 seed
 of
 truth
 though
 the
 secret
 processes
 of
 its
 growth
 be
 a
 mystery
 to
 all
 save
 God
 alone
 A
 man
 having
 planted
 seed
 must
 needs
 leave
 it
 alone
 He
 may
 tend
 the
 field
 removing
 weeds
 protecting
 the
 plants
 as
 best
 he
 may
 but
 the
 growth
 itself
 is
 dependent
 upon
 conditions
 and
 forces
 beyond
 his
 power
 to
 ultimately
 control
 Though
 it
 were
 Paul
 who
 planted
 and
 Apollos
 who
 watered
 none
 but
 God
 could
 insure
 the
 increase
 The
 one
 who
 sowed
 may
 go
 about
 his
 other
 affairs
 for
 the
 field
 does
 not
 demand
 continuous
 or
 exclusive
 attention
 nevertheless
 under
 the
 influences
 of
 sunshine
 and
 shower
 of
 breeze
 and
 dew
 the
 blade
 develops
 then
 the
 ear
 and
 in
 due
 time
 the
 full
 corn
 in
 the
 ear
 When
 the
 grain
 is
 ripe
 the
 man
 gladly
 harvests
 his
 crop
 The
 sower
 in
 this
 story
 is
 the
 authorized
 preacher
 of
 the
 word
 of
 God
 he
 implants
 the
 seed
 of
 the
 gospel
 in
 the
 hearts
 of
 men
 knowing
 not
 what
 the
 issue
 shall
 be
 Passing
 on
 to
 similar
 or
 other
 ministry
 elsewhere
 attending
 to
 his
 appointed
 duties
 in
 other
 fields
 he
 with
 faith
 and
 hope
 leaves
 with
 God
 the
 result
 of
 his
 planting
 In
 the
 harvest
 of
 souls
 converted
 through
 his
 labor
 he
 is
 enriched
 and
 made
 to
 rejoice
 This
 parable
 was
 probably
 directed
 more
 particularly
 to
 the
 apostles
 and
 the
 most
 devoted
 of
 the
 other
 disciples
 rather
 than
 to
 the
 multitude
 at
 large
 the
 lesson
 is
 one
 for
 teachers
 for
 workers
 in
 the
 Lords
 fields
 for
 the
 chosen
 sowers
 and
 reapers
 It
 is
 of
 perennial
 value
 as
 truly
 applicable
 today
 as
 when
 first
 spoken
 Let
 the
 seed
 be
 sown
 even
 though
 the
 sower
 be
 straightway
 called
 to
 other
 fields
 or
 other
 duties
 in
 the
 gladsome
 harvest
 he
 shall
 find
 his
 recompense
 THE
 MUSTARD
 SEED
 Another
 parable
 put
 he
 forth
 unto
 them
 saying
 The
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 like
 to
 a
 grain
 of
 mustard
 seed
 which
 a
 man
 took
 and
 sowed
 in
 his
 field
 which
 indeed
 is
 the
 least
 of
 all
 seeds
 but
 when
 it
 is
 grown
 it
 is
 the
 greatest
 among
 herbs
 and
 becometh
 a
 tree
 so
 that
 the
 birds
 of
 the
 air
 come
 and
 lodge
 in
 the
 branches
 thereof
 This
 little
 story
 addressed
 to
 the
 assembled
 multitude
 must
 have
 set
 many
 thinking
 because
 of
 the
 simplicity
 of
 the
 incident
 related
 and
 the
 thoroughly
 unJewish
 application
 made
 of
 it
 To
 the
 mind
 taught
 by
 teachers
 of
 the
 time
 the
 kingdom
 was
 to
 be
 great
 and
 glorious
 from
 its
 beginning
 it
 was
 to
 be
 ushered
 in
 by
 blare
 of
 trumpets
 and
 tramp
 of
 armies
 with
 King
 Messiah
 at
 the
 head
 yet
 this
 new
 Teacher
 spoke
 of
 it
 as
 having
 so
 small
 a
 beginning
 as
 to
 be
 comparable
 to
 a
 mustard
 seed
 To
 make
 the
 illustration
 more
 effective
 He
 specified
 that
 the
 seed
 spoken
 of
 was
 the
 least
 of
 all
 seeds
 This
 superlative
 expression
 was
 made
 in
 a
 relative
 sense
 for
 there
 were
 and
 are
 smaller
 seeds
 than
 the
 mustard
 even
 among
 garden
 plants
 among
 which
 rue
 and
 poppy
 have
 been
 named
 but
 each
 of
 these
 plants
 is
 very
 small
 in
 maturity
 while
 the
 wellcultivated
 mustard
 plant
 is
 one
 of
 the
 greatest
 among
 common
 herbs
 and
 presents
 a
 strong
 contrast
 of
 growth
 from
 tiny
 seed
 to
 spreading
 shrub
 Moreover
 the
 comparison
 as
 small
 as
 a
 mustard
 seed
 was
 in
 everyday
 use
 among
 Jews
 of
 the
 time
 The
 comparison
 employed
 by
 Jesus
 on
 another
 occasion
 evidences
 the
 common
 usage
 as
 when
 He
 said
 If
 ye
 have
 faith
 as
 a
 grain
 of
 mustard
 seed
 
 nothing
 shall
 be
 impossible
 unto
 you
 It
 should
 be
 known
 that
 the
 mustard
 plant
 attains
 in
 Palestine
 a
 larger
 growth
 than
 in
 more
 northerly
 climes
 The
 lesson
 of
 the
 parable
 is
 easy
 to
 read
 The
 seed
 is
 a
 living
 entity
 When
 rightly
 planted
 it
 absorbs
 and
 assimilates
 the
 nutritive
 matters
 of
 soil
 and
 atmosphere
 grows
 and
 in
 time
 is
 capable
 of
 affording
 lodgment
 and
 food
 to
 the
 birds
 So
 the
 seed
 of
 truth
 is
 vital
 living
 and
 capable
 of
 such
 development
 as
 to
 furnish
 spiritual
 food
 and
 shelter
 to
 all
 who
 come
 seeking
 In
 both
 conceptions
 the
 plant
 at
 maturity
 produces
 seed
 in
 abundance
 and
 so
 from
 a
 single
 grain
 a
 whole
 field
 may
 be
 covered
 THE
 LEAVEN
 Another
 parable
 spake
 he
 unto
 them
 The
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 like
 unto
 leaven
 which
 a
 woman
 took
 and
 hid
 in
 three
 measures
 of
 meal
 till
 the
 whole
 was
 leavened
 Points
 of
 both
 similarity
 and
 contrast
 between
 this
 parable
 and
 the
 last
 are
 easily
 discerned
 In
 each
 the
 inherent
 vitality
 and
 capacity
 for
 development
 so
 essentially
 characteristic
 of
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 are
 illustrated
 The
 mustard
 seed
 however
 typifies
 the
 effect
 of
 vital
 growth
 in
 gathering
 the
 substance
 of
 value
 from
 without
 while
 the
 leaven
 or
 yeast
 disseminates
 and
 diffuses
 outward
 its
 influence
 throughout
 the
 mass
 of
 otherwise
 dense
 and
 sodden
 dough
 Each
 of
 these
 processes
 represents
 a
 means
 whereby
 the
 Spirit
 of
 Truth
 is
 made
 effective
 Yeast
 is
 no
 less
 truly
 a
 living
 organism
 than
 a
 mustard
 seed
 As
 the
 microscopic
 yeast
 plant
 develops
 and
 multiplies
 within
 the
 dough
 its
 myriad
 living
 cells
 permeate
 the
 lump
 and
 every
 bit
 of
 the
 leavened
 mass
 is
 capable
 of
 affecting
 likewise
 another
 batch
 of
 properly
 prepared
 meal
 The
 process
 of
 leavening
 or
 causing
 dough
 to
 rise
 by
 the
 fermentation
 of
 the
 yeast
 placed
 in
 the
 mass
 is
 a
 slow
 one
 and
 moreover
 as
 quiet
 and
 seemingly
 secret
 as
 that
 of
 the
 planted
 seed
 growing
 without
 the
 sowers
 further
 attention
 or
 concern
 THE
 HIDDEN
 TREASURE
 Again
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 like
 unto
 treasure
 hid
 in
 a
 field
 the
 which
 when
 a
 man
 hath
 found
 he
 hideth
 and
 for
 joy
 thereof
 goeth
 and
 selleth
 all
 that
 he
 hath
 and
 buyeth
 that
 field
 This
 and
 the
 two
 parables
 following
 are
 recorded
 by
 Matthew
 only
 and
 the
 place
 assigned
 them
 in
 his
 narrative
 indicates
 that
 they
 were
 spoken
 to
 the
 disciples
 alone
 in
 the
 house
 after
 the
 multitude
 had
 departed
 The
 quest
 for
 treasuretrove
 is
 always
 fascinating
 Instances
 of
 finding
 buried
 valuables
 were
 not
 uncommon
 in
 the
 time
 of
 which
 we
 speak
 since
 the
 practise
 of
 so
 concealing
 treasure
 was
 usual
 with
 people
 exposed
 to
 bandit
 incursions
 and
 hostile
 invasion
 Observe
 that
 the
 fortunate
 and
 happy
 man
 is
 represented
 as
 finding
 the
 treasure
 seemingly
 by
 accident
 rather
 than
 as
 a
 result
 of
 diligent
 search
 He
 gladly
 sold
 all
 that
 he
 possessed
 to
 make
 possible
 his
 purchase
 of
 the
 field
 The
 hidden
 treasure
 is
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 when
 a
 man
 finds
 that
 he
 ought
 to
 be
 ready
 to
 sacrifice
 all
 that
 he
 has
 if
 by
 so
 doing
 he
 may
 gain
 possession
 His
 joy
 in
 the
 new
 acquisition
 will
 be
 unbounded
 and
 if
 he
 but
 remain
 a
 worthy
 holder
 the
 riches
 thereof
 shall
 be
 his
 beyond
 the
 grave
 Casuists
 have
 raised
 the
 question
 of
 propriety
 as
 to
 the
 mans
 course
 of
 action
 in
 the
 story
 inasmuch
 as
 he
 concealed
 the
 fact
 of
 his
 discovery
 from
 the
 owner
 of
 the
 field
 to
 whom
 the
 treasure
 they
 say
 rightly
 belonged
 Whatever
 opinion
 one
 may
 hold
 as
 to
 the
 ethics
 of
 the
 mans
 procedure
 his
 act
 was
 not
 illegal
 since
 there
 was
 an
 express
 provision
 in
 Jewish
 law
 that
 the
 purchaser
 of
 land
 became
 the
 legal
 owner
 of
 everything
 the
 ground
 contained
 Assuredly
 Jesus
 commended
 no
 dishonest
 course
 and
 had
 not
 the
 story
 been
 in
 every
 detail
 probable
 its
 effect
 as
 a
 parable
 would
 have
 been
 lost
 The
 Master
 taught
 by
 this
 illustration
 that
 when
 once
 the
 treasure
 of
 the
 kingdom
 is
 found
 the
 finder
 should
 lose
 no
 time
 nor
 shrink
 from
 any
 sacrifice
 needful
 to
 insure
 his
 title
 thereto
 THE
 PEARL
 OF
 GREAT
 PRICE
 Again
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 like
 unto
 a
 merchant
 man
 seeking
 goodly
 pearls
 who
 when
 he
 had
 found
 one
 pearl
 of
 great
 price
 went
 and
 sold
 all
 that
 he
 had
 and
 bought
 it
 Pearls
 have
 always
 held
 high
 place
 among
 gems
 and
 long
 before
 as
 indeed
 ever
 since
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 pearlmerchants
 have
 been
 active
 and
 diligent
 in
 seeking
 the
 largest
 and
 richest
 to
 be
 had
 Unlike
 the
 man
 in
 the
 last
 parable
 who
 found
 a
 hidden
 treasure
 with
 little
 or
 no
 search
 the
 merchant
 in
 this
 story
 devoted
 his
 whole
 energy
 to
 the
 quest
 for
 goodly
 pearls
 to
 find
 and
 secure
 which
 was
 his
 business
 When
 at
 last
 he
 beheld
 the
 pearl
 that
 excelled
 all
 others
 though
 it
 was
 as
 of
 right
 it
 ought
 to
 have
 been
 held
 at
 high
 cost
 he
 gladly
 sold
 all
 his
 other
 gems
 indeed
 he
 sacrificed
 all
 that
 he
 hadgems
 and
 other
 possessionsand
 purchased
 the
 pearl
 of
 great
 price
 Seekers
 after
 truth
 may
 acquire
 much
 that
 is
 good
 and
 desirable
 and
 not
 find
 the
 greatest
 truth
 of
 all
 the
 truth
 that
 shall
 save
 them
 Yet
 if
 they
 seek
 persistently
 and
 with
 right
 intent
 if
 they
 are
 really
 in
 quest
 of
 pearls
 and
 not
 of
 imitations
 they
 shall
 find
 Men
 who
 by
 search
 and
 research
 discover
 the
 truths
 of
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 may
 have
 to
 abandon
 many
 of
 their
 cherished
 traditions
 and
 even
 their
 theories
 of
 imperfect
 philosophy
 and
 science
 falsely
 so
 called
 if
 they
 would
 possess
 themselves
 of
 the
 pearl
 of
 great
 price
 Observe
 that
 in
 this
 parable
 as
 in
 that
 of
 the
 hidden
 treasure
 the
 price
 of
 possession
 is
 ones
 all
 No
 man
 can
 become
 a
 citizen
 of
 the
 kingdom
 by
 partial
 surrender
 of
 his
 earlier
 allegiances
 he
 must
 renounce
 everything
 foreign
 to
 the
 kingdom
 or
 he
 can
 never
 be
 numbered
 therein
 If
 he
 willingly
 sacrifices
 all
 that
 he
 has
 he
 shall
 find
 that
 he
 has
 enough
 The
 cost
 of
 the
 hidden
 treasure
 and
 of
 the
 pearl
 is
 not
 a
 fixed
 amount
 alike
 for
 all
 it
 is
 all
 one
 has
 Even
 the
 poorest
 may
 come
 into
 enduring
 possession
 his
 all
 is
 a
 sufficient
 purchase
 price
 THE
 GOSPEL
 NET
 Again
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 like
 unto
 a
 net
 that
 was
 cast
 into
 the
 sea
 and
 gathered
 of
 every
 kind
 which
 when
 it
 was
 full
 they
 drew
 to
 shore
 and
 sat
 down
 and
 gathered
 the
 good
 into
 vessels
 but
 cast
 the
 bad
 away
 So
 shall
 it
 be
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 world
 the
 angels
 shall
 come
 forth
 and
 sever
 the
 wicked
 from
 among
 the
 just
 and
 shall
 cast
 them
 into
 the
 furnace
 of
 fire
 there
 shall
 be
 wailing
 and
 gnashing
 of
 teeth
 Men
 of
 many
 minds
 men
 good
 and
 bad
 all
 nationalities
 and
 races
 are
 affected
 by
 the
 gospel
 of
 the
 kingdom
 The
 fishers
 of
 men
 are
 skilful
 active
 and
 comprehensive
 in
 their
 haul
 The
 sorting
 takes
 place
 after
 the
 net
 is
 brought
 to
 shore
 and
 as
 the
 fisherman
 discards
 every
 bad
 fish
 while
 he
 saves
 the
 good
 so
 shall
 the
 angels
 who
 do
 the
 bidding
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 separate
 the
 just
 and
 the
 wicked
 preserving
 the
 one
 kind
 to
 life
 eternal
 consigning
 the
 other
 to
 destruction
 Unwise
 efforts
 to
 carry
 the
 application
 of
 the
 parable
 beyond
 the
 Authors
 intent
 have
 suggested
 the
 criticism
 that
 whether
 the
 fish
 be
 good
 or
 bad
 they
 die
 The
 good
 however
 die
 to
 usefulness
 the
 bad
 to
 utter
 waste
 Though
 all
 men
 die
 they
 die
 not
 alike
 some
 pass
 to
 rest
 and
 shall
 come
 forth
 in
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 just
 others
 go
 to
 a
 state
 of
 sorrow
 and
 disquiet
 there
 to
 anxiously
 and
 with
 dread
 await
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 wicked
 Similarity
 of
 application
 in
 the
 present
 parable
 as
 in
 that
 of
 the
 tares
 is
 apparent
 in
 the
 emphasis
 given
 to
 the
 decreed
 separation
 of
 the
 just
 from
 the
 unjust
 and
 in
 the
 awful
 fate
 of
 those
 who
 are
 fit
 subjects
 for
 condemnation
 A
 further
 parallelism
 is
 noticed
 in
 the
 postponement
 of
 the
 judgment
 until
 the
 end
 of
 the
 world
 by
 which
 expression
 we
 may
 understand
 the
 consummation
 of
 the
 Redeemers
 work
 subsequent
 to
 the
 Millennium
 and
 the
 final
 resurrection
 of
 all
 who
 have
 had
 existence
 on
 earth
 Following
 His
 delivery
 of
 this
 the
 last
 of
 the
 group
 of
 parables
 recorded
 in
 the
 thirteenth
 chapter
 of
 Matthew
 Jesus
 asked
 the
 disciples
 Have
 ye
 understood
 all
 these
 things
 They
 answered
 Yea
 Lord
 He
 impressed
 upon
 them
 that
 they
 should
 be
 ready
 like
 welltaught
 teachers
 to
 bring
 from
 the
 storehouse
 of
 their
 souls
 treasures
 of
 truth
 both
 old
 and
 new
 for
 the
 edification
 of
 the
 world
 CHRISTS
 PURPOSE
 IN
 USING
 PARABLES
 As
 before
 stated
 the
 Twelve
 and
 other
 disciples
 were
 surprized
 at
 the
 Lords
 innovation
 of
 parabolic
 instruction
 Prior
 to
 that
 time
 His
 doctrines
 had
 been
 set
 forth
 in
 unveiled
 plainness
 as
 witness
 the
 explicit
 teachings
 in
 the
 Sermon
 on
 the
 Mount
 It
 is
 noticeable
 that
 the
 introduction
 of
 parables
 occurred
 when
 opposition
 to
 Jesus
 was
 strong
 and
 when
 scribes
 Pharisees
 and
 rabbis
 were
 alert
 in
 maintaining
 a
 close
 watch
 upon
 His
 movements
 and
 His
 works
 ever
 ready
 to
 make
 Him
 an
 offender
 for
 a
 word
 The
 use
 of
 parables
 was
 common
 among
 Jewish
 teachers
 and
 in
 adopting
 this
 mode
 of
 instruction
 Jesus
 was
 really
 following
 a
 custom
 of
 the
 time
 though
 between
 the
 parables
 He
 spake
 and
 those
 of
 the
 scholars
 there
 is
 possible
 no
 comparison
 except
 that
 of
 most
 pronounced
 contrast
 To
 the
 chosen
 and
 devoted
 followers
 who
 came
 asking
 the
 Master
 why
 He
 had
 changed
 from
 direct
 exposition
 to
 parables
 He
 explained
 that
 while
 it
 was
 their
 privilege
 to
 receive
 and
 understand
 the
 deeper
 truths
 of
 the
 gospel
 the
 mysteries
 of
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 as
 He
 expressed
 it
 with
 people
 in
 general
 who
 were
 unreceptive
 and
 unprepared
 such
 fulness
 of
 understanding
 was
 impossible
 To
 the
 disciples
 who
 had
 already
 gladly
 accepted
 the
 first
 principles
 of
 the
 gospel
 of
 Christ
 more
 should
 be
 given
 while
 from
 those
 who
 had
 rejected
 the
 proffered
 boon
 even
 what
 they
 had
 theretofore
 possessed
 should
 be
 taken
 away
 Therefore
 said
 He
 speak
 I
 to
 them
 in
 parables
 because
 they
 seeing
 see
 not
 and
 hearing
 they
 hear
 not
 neither
 do
 they
 understand
 That
 the
 state
 of
 spiritual
 darkness
 then
 existing
 among
 the
 Jews
 had
 been
 foreseen
 was
 instanced
 by
 a
 citation
 of
 Isaiahs
 words
 in
 which
 the
 ancient
 prophet
 had
 told
 of
 the
 people
 becoming
 blind
 deaf
 and
 hard
 of
 heart
 respecting
 the
 things
 of
 God
 whereby
 though
 they
 would
 both
 hear
 and
 see
 in
 a
 physical
 sense
 yet
 should
 they
 not
 understand
 There
 is
 plainly
 shown
 an
 element
 of
 mercy
 in
 the
 parabolic
 mode
 of
 instruction
 adopted
 by
 our
 Lord
 under
 the
 conditions
 prevailing
 at
 the
 time
 Had
 He
 always
 taught
 in
 explicit
 declaration
 such
 as
 required
 no
 interpretation
 many
 among
 His
 hearers
 would
 have
 come
 under
 condemnation
 inasmuch
 as
 they
 were
 too
 weak
 in
 faith
 and
 unprepared
 in
 heart
 to
 break
 the
 bonds
 of
 traditionalism
 and
 the
 prejudice
 engendered
 by
 sin
 so
 as
 to
 accept
 and
 obey
 the
 saving
 word
 Their
 inability
 to
 comprehend
 the
 requirements
 of
 the
 gospel
 would
 in
 righteous
 measure
 give
 Mercy
 some
 claim
 upon
 them
 while
 had
 they
 rejected
 the
 truth
 with
 full
 understanding
 stern
 Justice
 would
 surely
 demand
 their
 condemnation
 That
 the
 lesson
 of
 the
 parables
 was
 comprehensible
 through
 study
 prayer
 and
 search
 was
 intimated
 in
 the
 Teachers
 admonishment
 Who
 hath
 ears
 to
 hear
 let
 him
 hear
 To
 the
 more
 studious
 inquirers
 the
 Master
 added
 Take
 heed
 what
 ye
 hear
 with
 what
 measure
 ye
 mete
 it
 shall
 be
 measured
 to
 you
 and
 unto
 you
 that
 hear
 shall
 more
 be
 given
 For
 he
 that
 hath
 to
 him
 shall
 be
 given
 and
 he
 that
 hath
 not
 from
 him
 shall
 be
 taken
 even
 that
 which
 he
 hath
 Two
 men
 may
 hear
 the
 same
 words
 one
 of
 them
 listens
 in
 indolence
 and
 indifference
 the
 other
 with
 active
 mind
 intent
 on
 learning
 all
 that
 the
 words
 can
 possibly
 convey
 and
 having
 heard
 the
 diligent
 man
 goes
 straightway
 to
 do
 the
 things
 commended
 to
 him
 while
 the
 careless
 one
 neglects
 and
 forgets
 The
 one
 is
 wise
 the
 other
 foolish
 the
 one
 has
 heard
 to
 his
 eternal
 profit
 the
 other
 to
 his
 everlasting
 condemnation
 Another
 example
 of
 the
 merciful
 adaptation
 of
 the
 word
 of
 truth
 to
 the
 varied
 capacities
 of
 the
 people
 who
 heard
 the
 parables
 is
 found
 in
 the
 psychological
 fact
 that
 the
 incidents
 of
 an
 impressive
 though
 simple
 story
 will
 live
 even
 in
 minds
 which
 for
 the
 time
 being
 are
 incapable
 of
 comprehending
 any
 meaning
 beyond
 that
 of
 the
 commonplace
 story
 itself
 Many
 a
 peasant
 who
 had
 heard
 the
 little
 incident
 of
 the
 sower
 and
 the
 four
 kinds
 of
 soil
 of
 the
 tares
 sown
 by
 an
 enemy
 at
 night
 of
 the
 seed
 that
 grew
 though
 the
 planter
 had
 temporarily
 forgotten
 it
 would
 be
 reminded
 by
 the
 recurring
 circumstances
 of
 his
 daily
 work
 the
 gardener
 would
 recollect
 the
 story
 of
 the
 mustard
 seed
 whenever
 he
 planted
 afresh
 or
 when
 he
 looked
 upon
 the
 umbrageous
 plant
 with
 birds
 nesting
 in
 its
 branches
 the
 housewife
 would
 be
 impressed
 anew
 by
 the
 story
 of
 the
 leaven
 as
 she
 mixed
 and
 kneaded
 and
 baked
 the
 fisherman
 at
 his
 nets
 would
 think
 again
 of
 the
 good
 fish
 and
 the
 bad
 and
 compare
 the
 sorting
 of
 his
 catch
 with
 the
 judgment
 to
 come
 And
 then
 when
 time
 and
 experience
 including
 suffering
 perhaps
 had
 prepared
 them
 for
 deeper
 thought
 they
 would
 find
 the
 living
 kernel
 of
 gospel
 truth
 within
 the
 husk
 of
 the
 simple
 tale
 PARABLES
 IN
 GENERAL
 The
 essential
 feature
 of
 a
 parable
 is
 that
 of
 comparison
 or
 similitude
 by
 which
 some
 ordinary
 wellunderstood
 incident
 is
 used
 to
 illustrate
 a
 fact
 or
 principle
 not
 directly
 expressed
 in
 the
 story
 The
 popular
 thought
 that
 a
 parable
 necessarily
 rests
 on
 a
 fictitious
 incident
 is
 incorrect
 for
 inasmuch
 as
 the
 story
 or
 circumstance
 of
 the
 parable
 must
 be
 simple
 and
 indeed
 commonplace
 it
 may
 be
 real
 There
 is
 no
 fiction
 in
 the
 parables
 we
 have
 thus
 far
 studied
 the
 fundamental
 stories
 are
 true
 to
 life
 and
 the
 given
 circumstances
 are
 facts
 of
 experience
 The
 narrative
 or
 incident
 upon
 which
 a
 parable
 is
 constructed
 may
 be
 an
 actual
 occurrence
 or
 fiction
 but
 if
 fictitious
 the
 story
 must
 be
 consistent
 and
 probable
 with
 no
 admixture
 of
 the
 unusual
 or
 miraculous
 In
 this
 respect
 the
 parable
 differs
 from
 the
 fable
 the
 latter
 being
 imaginative
 exaggerated
 and
 improbable
 as
 to
 fact
 moreover
 the
 intent
 is
 unlike
 in
 the
 two
 since
 the
 parable
 is
 designed
 to
 convey
 some
 great
 spiritual
 truth
 while
 the
 socalled
 moral
 of
 the
 fable
 is
 at
 best
 suggestive
 only
 of
 worldly
 achievement
 and
 personal
 advantage
 Stories
 of
 trees
 animals
 and
 inanimate
 things
 talking
 together
 or
 with
 men
 are
 wholly
 fanciful
 they
 are
 fables
 or
 apologues
 whether
 the
 outcome
 be
 depicted
 as
 good
 or
 bad
 to
 the
 parable
 these
 show
 contrast
 not
 similarity
 The
 avowed
 purpose
 of
 the
 fable
 is
 rather
 to
 amuse
 than
 to
 teach
 The
 parable
 may
 embody
 a
 narrative
 as
 in
 the
 instances
 of
 the
 sower
 and
 the
 tares
 or
 merely
 an
 isolated
 incident
 as
 in
 those
 of
 the
 mustard
 seed
 and
 the
 leaven
 Allegories
 are
 distinguished
 from
 parables
 by
 greater
 length
 and
 detail
 of
 the
 story
 and
 by
 the
 intimate
 admixture
 of
 the
 narrative
 with
 the
 lesson
 it
 is
 designed
 to
 teach
 these
 are
 kept
 distinctly
 separate
 in
 the
 parable
 Myths
 are
 fictitious
 stories
 sometimes
 with
 historic
 basis
 of
 fact
 but
 without
 symbolism
 of
 spiritual
 worth
 A
 proverb
 is
 a
 short
 sententious
 saying
 in
 the
 nature
 of
 a
 maxim
 connoting
 a
 definite
 truth
 or
 suggestion
 by
 comparison
 Proverbs
 and
 parables
 are
 closely
 related
 and
 in
 the
 Bible
 the
 terms
 are
 sometimes
 used
 interchangeably
 The
 Old
 Testament
 contains
 two
 parables
 a
 few
 fables
 and
 allegories
 and
 numerous
 proverbs
 of
 the
 lastnamed
 we
 possess
 an
 entire
 book
 Nathan
 the
 prophet
 reproved
 King
 David
 by
 the
 parable
 of
 the
 poor
 mans
 ewe
 lamb
 and
 so
 effective
 was
 the
 story
 that
 the
 king
 decreed
 punishment
 for
 the
 wealthy
 offender
 and
 was
 overcome
 by
 sorrow
 and
 contrition
 when
 the
 prophet
 made
 application
 of
 his
 parable
 by
 the
 fateful
 words
 Thou
 art
 the
 man
 The
 story
 of
 the
 vineyard
 which
 though
 fenced
 and
 welltended
 yet
 brought
 forth
 only
 wild
 useless
 fruit
 was
 used
 by
 Isaiah
 to
 portray
 the
 sinful
 state
 of
 Israel
 in
 his
 attempt
 to
 awaken
 the
 people
 to
 lives
 of
 righteousness
 The
 parables
 of
 the
 New
 Testament
 spoken
 by
 the
 Teacher
 of
 teachers
 are
 of
 such
 beauty
 simplicity
 and
 effectiveness
 as
 to
 stand
 unparalleled
 in
 literature
 NOTES
 TO
 CHAPTER
 
 
 The
 First
 Group
 of
 ParablesMany
 Bible
 scholars
 hold
 that
 the
 seven
 parables
 recorded
 in
 the
 thirteenth
 chapter
 of
 Matthew
 were
 spoken
 at
 different
 times
 and
 to
 different
 people
 and
 that
 the
 writer
 of
 the
 first
 Gospel
 grouped
 them
 for
 convenience
 in
 recording
 and
 with
 prime
 consideration
 of
 their
 subjective
 interest
 Some
 color
 is
 found
 for
 this
 claim
 in
 Lukes
 mention
 of
 some
 of
 these
 parables
 in
 different
 relations
 of
 both
 time
 and
 place
 thus
 the
 parables
 of
 the
 Mustard
 Seed
 and
 the
 Leaven
 are
 given
 Luke
 
 
 as
 directly
 following
 the
 healing
 of
 the
 infirm
 woman
 in
 the
 synagog
 and
 the
 rebuke
 to
 the
 hypocritical
 ruler
 While
 we
 must
 admit
 that
 Matthew
 may
 have
 grouped
 with
 the
 parables
 spoken
 on
 that
 particular
 day
 some
 of
 other
 dates
 it
 is
 probable
 that
 Jesus
 repeated
 some
 of
 His
 parables
 as
 He
 certainly
 did
 other
 teachings
 and
 thus
 presented
 the
 same
 lesson
 on
 more
 occasions
 than
 one
 As
 a
 matter
 of
 fact
 each
 parable
 is
 a
 lesson
 in
 itself
 and
 holds
 its
 high
 intrinsic
 value
 whether
 considered
 as
 an
 isolated
 story
 or
 in
 connection
 with
 related
 teachings
 Let
 us
 give
 heed
 to
 the
 lesson

 may
 promulgate

 Setting

 Parable
 of
 the
 SowerDr

 C
 Trench
 in
 his

 work
 Notes
 on
 the
 Parables
 of
 our
 Lord
 p
 
 note
 quotes
 Dean
 Stanleys
 description
 of
 existing
 conditions
 in
 the
 place
 where
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Sower
 was
 given
 by
 Jesus
 and
 as
 there
 is
 reason
 to
 believe
 that
 the
 environment
 has
 changed
 but
 little
 since
 the
 days
 of
 Christ
 the
 account
 is
 here
 reproduced
 A
 slight
 recess
 in
 the
 hillside
 close
 upon
 the
 plain
 disclosed
 at
 once
 in
 detail
 and
 with
 a
 conjunction
 which
 I
 remember
 nowhere
 else
 in
 Palestine
 every
 feature
 of
 the
 great
 parable
 There
 was
 the
 undulating
 cornfield
 descending
 to
 the
 waters
 edge
 There
 was
 the
 trodden
 pathway
 running
 through
 the
 midst
 of
 it
 with
 no
 fence
 or
 hedge
 to
 prevent
 the
 seed
 falling
 here
 or
 there
 on
 either
 side
 of
 it
 or
 upon
 ititself
 hard
 with
 the
 constant
 tramp
 of
 horse
 and
 mule
 and
 human
 feet
 There
 was
 the
 good
 rich
 soil
 which
 distinguishes
 the
 whole
 of
 that
 plain
 and
 its
 neighborhood
 from
 the
 bare
 hills
 elsewhere
 descending
 into
 the
 lake
 and
 which
 where
 there
 is
 no
 interruption
 produces
 one
 vast
 mass
 of
 corn
 There
 was
 the
 rocky
 ground
 of
 the
 hillside
 protruding
 here
 and
 there
 through
 the
 cornfields
 as
 elsewhere
 through
 the
 grassy
 slopes
 There
 were
 the
 large
 bushes
 of
 thorn
 the
 nabk
 
 springing
 up
 like
 the
 fruittrees
 of
 the
 more
 inland
 parts
 in
 the
 very
 midst
 of
 the
 waving
 wheat
 
 TaresThis
 term
 occurs
 nowhere
 within
 the
 Bible
 except
 in
 this
 instance
 of
 the
 parable
 Plainly
 any
 kind
 of
 weed
 particularly
 a
 poisonous
 sort
 such
 as
 would
 seriously
 depreciate
 the
 garnered
 crop
 would
 serve
 the
 Masters
 purpose
 in
 the
 illustration
 The
 traditional
 belief
 commonly
 held
 is
 that
 the
 plant
 referred
 to
 in
 the
 parable
 is
 the
 darnel
 weed
 known
 to
 botanists
 as
 Lolium
 temulenium
 a
 species
 of
 bearded
 ryegrass
 This
 plant
 closely
 resembles
 wheat
 in
 the
 early
 period
 of
 growth
 and
 exists
 as
 a
 pest
 to
 the
 farmers
 in
 Palestine
 today
 it
 is
 called
 by
 the
 Arabians
 Zowan
 or
 Zawan
 which
 name
 says
 Arnot
 citing
 Thompson
 bears
 some
 resemblance
 to
 the
 original
 word
 in
 the
 Greek
 text
 The
 writer
 of
 the
 article
 Tares
 in
 Smiths
 Dictionary
 says
 Critics
 and
 expositors
 are
 agreed
 that
 the
 Greek
 plural
 zizania
 AV
 tares
 of
 the
 parable
 Matt
 
 denotes
 the
 weed
 called
 bearded
 darnel
 Lolium
 temulentum
 a
 widelydistributed
 grass
 and
 the
 only
 species
 of
 the
 order
 that
 has
 deleterious
 properties
 The
 bearded
 darnel
 before
 it
 comes
 into
 ear
 is
 very
 similar
 in
 appearance
 to
 wheat
 and
 the
 roots
 of
 the
 two
 are
 often
 intertwined
 hence
 the
 command
 that
 the
 tares
 should
 be
 left
 till
 the
 harvest
 lest
 while
 men
 plucked
 up
 the
 tares
 they
 should
 root
 up
 also
 the
 wheat
 with
 them
 This
 darnel
 is
 easily
 distinguishable
 from
 the
 wheat
 and
 barley
 when
 headed
 out
 but
 when
 both
 are
 less
 developed
 the
 closest
 scrutiny
 will
 often
 fail
 to
 detect
 it
 Even
 the
 farmers
 who
 in
 this
 country
 generally
 weed
 their
 fields
 do
 not
 attempt
 to
 separate
 the
 one
 from
 the
 other
 
 The
 taste
 is
 bitter
 and
 when
 eaten
 separately
 or
 even
 when
 diffused
 in
 ordinary
 bread
 it
 causes
 dizziness
 and
 often
 acts
 as
 a
 violent
 emetic
 The
 secondary
 quotation
 is
 from
 Thompsons
 The
 Land
 and
 the
 Book
 ii
 
 
 It
 has
 been
 asserted
 that
 the
 darnel
 is
 a
 degenerated
 kind
 of
 wheat
 and
 attempts
 have
 been
 made
 to
 give
 additional
 significance
 to
 our
 Lords
 instructive
 parable
 by
 injecting
 this
 thought
 there
 is
 no
 scientific
 warrant
 for
 the
 strained
 conception
 however
 and
 earnest
 students
 will
 not
 be
 misled
 thereby
 
 The
 Wickedness
 of
 the
 Sower
 of
 TaresAttempts
 have
 been
 made
 to
 disparage
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Tares
 on
 the
 ground
 that
 it
 rests
 on
 an
 unusual
 if
 not
 unknown
 practise
 Trench
 thus
 meets
 the
 criticism
 Notes
 on
 the
 Parables
 pp
 
 
 Our
 Lord
 did
 not
 imagine
 here
 a
 form
 of
 malice
 without
 example
 but
 adduced
 one
 which
 may
 have
 been
 familiar
 enough
 to
 His
 hearers
 one
 so
 easy
 of
 execution
 involving
 so
 little
 risk
 and
 yet
 effecting
 so
 great
 and
 lasting
 a
 mischief
 that
 it
 is
 not
 strange
 where
 cowardice
 and
 malice
 meet
 that
 this
 should
 have
 been
 often
 the
 shape
 in
 which
 they
 displayed
 themselves
 We
 meet
 traces
 of
 it
 in
 many
 quarters
 In
 Roman
 law
 the
 possibility
 of
 this
 form
 of
 injury
 is
 contemplated
 and
 a
 modern
 writer
 illustrating
 Scripture
 from
 the
 manners
 and
 habits
 of
 the
 East
 with
 which
 he
 had
 become
 familiar
 through
 a
 sojourn
 there
 affirms
 the
 same
 to
 be
 now
 practised
 in
 India
 In
 a
 subjoined
 note
 the
 author
 adds
 We
 are
 not
 without
 this
 form
 of
 malice
 nearer
 home
 Thus
 in
 Ireland
 I
 have
 known
 an
 outgoing
 tenant
 in
 spite
 at
 his
 eviction
 to
 sow
 wild
 oats
 in
 the
 fields
 which
 he
 was
 leaving
 These
 like
 the
 tares
 in
 the
 parable
 ripening
 and
 seeding
 themselves
 before
 the
 crops
 in
 which
 they
 were
 mingled
 it
 became
 next
 to
 impossible
 to
 extirpate
 
 The
 Parable
 of
 the
 Seed
 Growing
 SecretlyThis
 parable
 has
 given
 rise
 to
 much
 discussion
 among
 expositors
 the
 question
 being
 as
 to
 who
 is
 meant
 by
 the
 man
 who
 cast
 seed
 into
 the
 ground
 If
 as
 in
 the
 parables
 of
 the
 Sower
 and
 the
 Tares
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 be
 the
 planter
 then
 some
 ask
 how
 can
 it
 be
 said
 that
 the
 seed
 should
 spring
 and
 grow
 up
 he
 knoweth
 not
 how
 when
 all
 things
 are
 known
 unto
 Him
 If
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 the
 planter
 represents
 the
 authorized
 teacher
 or
 preacher
 of
 the
 gospel
 how
 can
 it
 be
 said
 that
 at
 the
 harvest
 time
 he
 putteth
 in
 the
 sickle
 since
 the
 final
 harvesting
 of
 souls
 is
 the
 prerogative
 of
 God
 The
 perplexities
 of
 the
 critics
 arise
 from
 their
 attempt
 to
 find
 in
 the
 parable
 a
 literalism
 never
 intended
 by
 the
 Author
 Whether
 the
 seed
 be
 planted
 by
 the
 Lord
 Himself
 as
 when
 He
 taught
 in
 Person
 or
 by
 any
 one
 of
 His
 authorized
 servants
 the
 seed
 is
 alive
 and
 will
 grow
 Time
 is
 required
 the
 blade
 appears
 first
 and
 is
 followed
 by
 the
 ear
 and
 the
 ear
 ripens
 in
 season
 without
 the
 constant
 attention
 which
 a
 shaping
 of
 the
 several
 parts
 by
 hand
 would
 require
 The
 man
 who
 figures
 in
 the
 parable
 is
 presented
 as
 an
 ordinary
 farmer
 who
 plants
 and
 waits
 and
 in
 due
 time
 reaps
 The
 lesson
 imparted
 is
 the
 vitality
 of
 the
 seed
 as
 a
 living
 thing
 endowed
 by
 its
 Creator
 with
 the
 capacity
 to
 both
 grow
 and
 develop
 
 The
 Mustard
 PlantThe
 wild
 mustard
 which
 in
 the
 temperate
 zone
 seldom
 attains
 a
 height
 of
 more
 than
 three
 or
 four
 feet
 reaches
 in
 semitropical
 lands
 the
 height
 of
 a
 horse
 and
 its
 rider
 Thompson
 The
 Land
 and
 the
 Book
 ii
 
 Those
 who
 heard
 the
 parable
 evidently
 understood
 the
 contrast
 between
 size
 of
 seed
 and
 that
 of
 the
 fully
 developed
 plant
 Arnot
 The
 Parables
 p
 
 aptly
 says
 This
 plant
 obviously
 was
 chosen
 by
 the
 Lord
 not
 on
 account
 of
 its
 absolute
 magnitude
 but
 because
 it
 was
 and
 was
 recognized
 to
 be
 a
 striking
 instance
 of
 increase
 from
 very
 small
 to
 very
 great
 It
 seems
 to
 have
 been
 in
 Palestine
 at
 that
 time
 the
 smallest
 seed
 from
 which
 so
 large
 a
 plant
 was
 known
 to
 grow
 There
 were
 perhaps
 smaller
 seeds
 but
 the
 plants
 which
 sprung
 from
 them
 were
 not
 so
 great
 and
 there
 were
 greater
 plants
 but
 the
 seeds
 from
 which
 they
 sprung
 were
 not
 so
 small
 Edersheim
 i
 p
 
 states
 that
 the
 diminutive
 size
 of
 the
 mustard
 seed
 was
 commonly
 used
 in
 comparison
 by
 the
 rabbis
 to
 indicate
 the
 smallest
 amount
 such
 as
 the
 least
 drop
 of
 blood
 the
 least
 defilement
 etc
 The
 same
 author
 continues
 in
 speaking
 of
 the
 grown
 plant
 Indeed
 it
 looks
 no
 longer
 like
 a
 large
 gardenherb
 or
 shrub
 but
 becomes
 or
 rather
 appears
 like
 a
 treeas
 St
 Luke
 puts
 it
 a
 great
 tree
 of
 course
 not
 in
 comparison
 with
 other
 trees
 but
 with
 gardenshrubs
 Such
 growth
 of
 mustard
 seed
 was
 also
 a
 fact
 well
 known
 at
 the
 time
 and
 indeed
 still
 observed
 in
 the
 East
 And
 the
 general
 meaning
 would
 the
 more
 easily
 be
 apprehended
 that
 a
 tree
 whose
 widespreading
 branches
 afforded
 lodgment
 to
 the
 birds
 of
 heaven
 was
 a
 familiar
 Old
 Testament
 figure
 for
 a
 mighty
 kingdom
 that
 gave
 shelter
 to
 the
 nations
 Ezek
 
 
 Dan
 
 
 
 
 Indeed
 it
 is
 specifically
 used
 as
 an
 illustration
 of
 the
 Messianic
 Kingdom
 Ezek
 
 
 The
 Symbolism
 of
 LeavenIn
 the
 parable
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 likened
 unto
 leaven
 In
 other
 scriptures
 leaven
 is
 figuratively
 mentioned
 as
 representing
 evil
 thus
 the
 leaven
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 and
 of
 the
 Sadducees
 Matt
 
 see
 also
 Luke
 
 the
 leaven
 of
 Herod
 Mark
 
 These
 instances
 and
 others
 
 Cor
 
 
 are
 illustrative
 of
 the
 contagion
 of
 evil
 In
 the
 incident
 of
 the
 woman
 using
 leaven
 in
 the
 ordinary
 process
 of
 breadmaking
 the
 spreading
 penetrating
 vital
 effect
 of
 truth
 is
 symbolized
 by
 the
 leaven
 The
 same
 thing
 in
 different
 aspects
 may
 very
 properly
 be
 used
 to
 represent
 good
 in
 one
 instance
 and
 evil
 in
 another
 
 Treasure
 Belonging
 to
 the
 FinderAs
 to
 the
 justification
 of
 the
 man
 who
 found
 a
 treasure
 hidden
 in
 anothers
 field
 and
 then
 concealing
 the
 fact
 of
 his
 discovery
 bought
 the
 field
 that
 he
 might
 possess
 the
 treasure
 Edersheim
 i
 p
 
 says
 Some
 difficulty
 has
 been
 expressed
 in
 regard
 to
 the
 morality
 of
 such
 a
 transaction
 In
 reply
 it
 may
 be
 observed
 that
 it
 was
 at
 least
 in
 entire
 accordance
 with
 Jewish
 law
 If
 a
 man
 had
 found
 a
 treasure
 in
 loose
 coins
 among
 the
 corn
 it
 would
 certainly
 be
 his
 if
 he
 bought
 the
 corn
 If
 he
 had
 found
 it
 on
 the
 ground
 or
 in
 the
 soil
 it
 would
 equally
 certainly
 belong
 to
 him
 if
 he
 could
 claim
 ownership
 of
 the
 soil
 and
 even
 if
 the
 field
 were
 not
 his
 own
 unless
 others
 could
 prove
 their
 right
 to
 it
 The
 law
 went
 so
 far
 as
 to
 adjudge
 to
 the
 purchaser
 of
 fruits
 anything
 found
 among
 these
 fruits
 This
 will
 suffice
 to
 vindicate
 a
 question
 of
 detail
 which
 in
 any
 case
 should
 not
 be
 too
 closely
 pressed
 in
 a
 parabolic
 history
 
 Superiority
 of
 our
 Lords
 ParablesPerhaps
 no
 other
 mode
 of
 teaching
 was
 so
 common
 among
 the
 Jews
 as
 that
 by
 parables
 Only
 in
 their
 case
 they
 were
 almost
 entirely
 illustrations
 of
 what
 had
 been
 said
 or
 taught
 while
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Christ
 they
 served
 as
 the
 foundation
 for
 His
 teaching
 In
 the
 one
 case
 it
 was
 intended
 to
 make
 spiritual
 teaching
 appear
 Jewish
 and
 national
 in
 the
 other
 to
 convey
 spiritual
 teaching
 in
 a
 form
 adapted
 to
 the
 standpoint
 of
 the
 hearers
 This
 distinction
 will
 be
 found
 to
 hold
 true
 even
 in
 instances
 where
 there
 seems
 the
 closest
 parallelism
 between
 a
 Rabbinic
 and
 an
 Evangelic
 parable
 It
 need
 scarcely
 be
 said
 that
 comparison
 between
 such
 parables
 as
 regards
 their
 spirit
 is
 scarcely
 possible
 except
 by
 way
 of
 contrast
 Edersheim
 i
 pp
 
 Geikie
 tersely
 says
 Others
 have
 uttered
 parables
 but
 Jesus
 so
 far
 transcends
 them
 that
 He
 may
 justly
 be
 called
 the
 creator
 of
 this
 mode
 of
 instruction
 ii
 p
 
 
 Parables
 and
 Other
 Forms
 of
 AnalogyThe
 parable
 is
 also
 clearly
 distinguishable
 from
 the
 proverb
 though
 it
 is
 true
 that
 in
 a
 certain
 degree
 the
 words
 are
 used
 interchangeably
 in
 the
 New
 Testament
 and
 as
 equivalent
 the
 one
 to
 the
 other
 Thus
 Physician
 heal
 thyself
 Luke
 
 is
 termed
 a
 parable
 being
 more
 strictly
 a
 proverb
 so
 again
 when
 the
 Lord
 had
 used
 that
 proverb
 probably
 already
 familiar
 to
 His
 hearers
 If
 the
 blind
 lead
 the
 blind
 both
 shall
 fall
 into
 the
 ditch
 Peter
 said
 Declare
 unto
 us
 this
 parable
 Matt
 
 
 and
 Luke
 
 is
 a
 proverb
 or
 proverbial
 expression
 rather
 than
 a
 parable
 which
 name
 it
 bears
 So
 upon
 the
 other
 hand
 those
 are
 called
 proverbs
 in
 St
 John
 which
 if
 not
 strictly
 parables
 yet
 claim
 much
 closer
 affinity
 to
 the
 parable
 than
 to
 the
 proverb
 being
 in
 fact
 allegories
 thus
 Christs
 setting
 forth
 of
 His
 relations
 to
 His
 people
 under
 those
 of
 a
 shepherd
 to
 his
 sheep
 is
 termed
 a
 proverb
 though
 our
 translators
 holding
 fast
 to
 the
 sense
 rather
 than
 to
 the
 letter
 have
 rendered
 it
 a
 parable
 John
 
 compare
 
 
 It
 is
 easy
 to
 account
 for
 this
 interchange
 of
 words
 Partly
 it
 arose
 from
 one
 word
 in
 Hebrew
 signifying
 both
 parable
 and
 proverbTrench

 CHAPTER
 
 PEACE
 BE
 STILL
 INCIDENTS
 PRELIMINARY
 TO
 THE
 VOYAGE
 Near
 the
 close
 of
 the
 day
 on
 which
 Jesus
 had
 taught
 the
 multitudes
 for
 the
 first
 time
 by
 parables
 He
 said
 to
 the
 disciples
 Let
 us
 pass
 over
 unto
 the
 other
 side
 The
 destination
 so
 indicated
 is
 the
 east
 side
 of
 the
 sea
 of
 Galilee
 While
 the
 boat
 was
 being
 made
 ready
 a
 certain
 scribe
 came
 to
 Jesus
 and
 said
 Master
 I
 will
 follow
 thee
 whithersoever
 thou
 goest
 Prior
 to
 that
 time
 few
 men
 belonging
 to
 the
 titled
 or
 ruling
 class
 had
 offered
 to
 openly
 ally
 themselves
 with
 Jesus
 Had
 the
 Master
 been
 mindful
 of
 policy
 and
 desirous
 of
 securing
 official
 recognition
 this
 opportunity
 to
 attach
 to
 Himself
 as
 influential
 a
 person
 as
 a
 scribe
 would
 have
 received
 careful
 consideration
 if
 not
 immediate
 acceptance
 but
 He
 who
 could
 read
 the
 minds
 and
 know
 the
 hearts
 of
 men
 chose
 rather
 than
 accepted
 He
 had
 called
 men
 who
 were
 to
 be
 thenceforth
 His
 own
 from
 their
 fishing
 boats
 and
 nets
 and
 had
 numbered
 one
 of
 the
 ostracized
 publicans
 among
 the
 Twelve
 but
 He
 knew
 them
 every
 one
 and
 chose
 accordingly
 The
 gospel
 was
 offered
 freely
 to
 all
 but
 authority
 to
 officiate
 as
 a
 minister
 thereof
 was
 not
 to
 be
 had
 for
 the
 asking
 for
 that
 sacred
 labor
 one
 must
 be
 called
 of
 God
 In
 this
 instance
 Christ
 knew
 the
 character
 of
 the
 man
 and
 without
 wounding
 his
 feelings
 by
 curt
 rejection
 pointed
 out
 the
 sacrifice
 required
 of
 one
 who
 would
 follow
 whithersoever
 the
 Lord
 went
 saying
 The
 foxes
 have
 holes
 and
 the
 birds
 of
 the
 air
 have
 nests
 but
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 hath
 not
 where
 to
 lay
 his
 head
 As
 Jesus
 had
 no
 fixed
 place
 of
 abode
 but
 went
 wherever
 His
 duty
 called
 Him
 so
 was
 it
 necessary
 that
 they
 who
 represented
 Him
 men
 ordained
 or
 set
 apart
 to
 His
 service
 be
 ready
 to
 deny
 themselves
 the
 enjoyment
 of
 their
 homes
 and
 the
 comfort
 of
 family
 associations
 if
 the
 duties
 of
 their
 calling
 so
 demanded
 We
 do
 not
 read
 that
 the
 aspiring
 scribe
 pressed
 his
 offer
 Another
 man
 indicated
 his
 willingness
 to
 follow
 the
 Lord
 but
 asked
 first
 for
 time
 to
 go
 and
 bury
 his
 father
 to
 him
 Jesus
 said
 Follow
 me
 and
 let
 the
 dead
 bury
 their
 dead
 Some
 readers
 have
 felt
 that
 this
 injunction
 was
 harsh
 though
 such
 an
 inference
 is
 scarcely
 justified
 While
 it
 would
 be
 manifestly
 unfilial
 for
 a
 son
 to
 absent
 himself
 from
 his
 fathers
 funeral
 under
 ordinary
 conditions
 nevertheless
 if
 that
 son
 had
 been
 set
 apart
 to
 service
 of
 importance
 transcending
 all
 personal
 or
 family
 obligations
 his
 ministerial
 duty
 would
 of
 right
 take
 precedence
 Moreover
 the
 requirement
 expressed
 by
 Jesus
 was
 no
 greater
 than
 that
 made
 of
 every
 priest
 during
 his
 term
 of
 active
 service
 nor
 was
 it
 more
 afflicting
 than
 the
 obligation
 of
 the
 Nazarite
 vow
 under
 which
 many
 voluntarily
 placed
 themselves
 The
 duties
 of
 ministry
 in
 the
 kingdom
 pertained
 to
 spiritual
 life
 one
 dedicated
 thereto
 might
 well
 allow
 those
 who
 were
 negligent
 of
 spiritual
 things
 and
 figuratively
 speaking
 spiritually
 dead
 to
 bury
 their
 dead
 A
 third
 instance
 is
 presented
 a
 man
 who
 wanted
 to
 be
 a
 disciple
 of
 the
 Lord
 asked
 that
 before
 entering
 upon
 his
 duties
 he
 be
 permitted
 to
 go
 home
 and
 bid
 farewell
 to
 his
 family
 and
 friends
 The
 reply
 of
 Jesus
 has
 become
 an
 aphorism
 in
 life
 and
 literature
 No
 man
 having
 put
 his
 hand
 to
 the
 plough
 and
 looking
 back
 is
 fit
 for
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 From
 Matthews
 record
 we
 draw
 the
 inference
 that
 the
 first
 two
 of
 these
 candidates
 for
 discipleship
 offered
 themselves
 to
 our
 Lord
 as
 He
 stood
 on
 the
 shore
 or
 in
 the
 boat
 ready
 to
 begin
 the
 evening
 voyage
 across
 the
 lake
 Luke
 places
 the
 instances
 in
 a
 different
 connection
 and
 adds
 to
 the
 offers
 of
 the
 scribe
 and
 the
 man
 who
 would
 first
 bury
 his
 father
 that
 of
 the
 one
 who
 wished
 to
 go
 home
 and
 then
 return
 to
 Christ
 The
 three
 incidents
 may
 be
 profitably
 considered
 together
 whether
 all
 occurred
 in
 the
 evening
 of
 that
 same
 eventful
 day
 or
 at
 different
 times
 STILLING
 THE
 STORM
 The
 instruction
 to
 launch
 forth
 and
 cross
 to
 the
 opposite
 side
 of
 the
 lake
 was
 given
 by
 Jesus
 who
 probably
 desired
 a
 respite
 after
 the
 arduous
 labors
 of
 the
 day
 No
 time
 had
 been
 lost
 in
 unnecessary
 preparation
 they
 took
 him
 even
 as
 he
 was
 into
 the
 ship
 and
 set
 out
 without
 delay
 Even
 on
 the
 water
 some
 of
 the
 eager
 people
 tried
 to
 follow
 for
 a
 number
 of
 small
 boats
 little
 ships
 as
 Mark
 styles
 them
 accompanied
 the
 vessel
 on
 which
 Jesus
 was
 embarked
 but
 these
 lesser
 craft
 may
 have
 turned
 back
 possibly
 on
 account
 of
 the
 approaching
 storm
 anyway
 we
 do
 not
 hear
 of
 them
 further
 Jesus
 found
 a
 resting
 place
 near
 the
 stern
 of
 the
 ship
 and
 soon
 fell
 asleep
 A
 great
 storm
 arose
 and
 still
 He
 slept
 The
 circumstance
 is
 instructive
 as
 it
 evidences
 at
 once
 the
 reality
 of
 the
 physical
 attributes
 of
 Christ
 and
 the
 healthy
 normal
 condition
 of
 His
 body
 He
 was
 subject
 to
 fatigue
 and
 bodily
 exhaustion
 from
 other
 causes
 as
 are
 all
 men
 without
 food
 He
 grew
 hungry
 without
 drink
 He
 thirsted
 by
 labor
 He
 became
 weary
 The
 fact
 that
 after
 a
 day
 of
 strenuous
 effort
 He
 could
 calmly
 sleep
 even
 amidst
 the
 turmoil
 of
 a
 tempest
 indicates
 an
 unimpaired
 nervous
 system
 and
 a
 good
 state
 of
 health
 Nowhere
 do
 we
 find
 record
 of
 Jesus
 having
 been
 ill
 He
 lived
 according
 to
 the
 laws
 of
 health
 yet
 never
 allowed
 the
 body
 to
 rule
 the
 spirit
 and
 His
 daily
 activities
 which
 were
 of
 a
 kind
 to
 make
 heavy
 demands
 on
 both
 physical
 and
 mental
 energy
 were
 met
 with
 no
 symptoms
 of
 nervous
 collapse
 nor
 of
 functional
 disturbance
 Sleep
 after
 toil
 is
 natural
 and
 necessary
 The
 days
 work
 done
 Jesus
 slept
 Meanwhile
 the
 storm
 increased
 in
 fury
 the
 wind
 rendered
 the
 boat
 unmanageable
 waves
 beat
 over
 the
 side
 so
 much
 water
 was
 shipped
 that
 the
 vessel
 seemed
 about
 to
 founder
 The
 disciples
 were
 terrorstricken
 yet
 through
 it
 all
 Jesus
 rested
 peacefully
 In
 their
 extremity
 of
 fear
 the
 disciples
 awakened
 Him
 crying
 out
 according
 to
 the
 several
 independent
 accounts
 Master
 Master
 we
 perish
 Lord
 save
 us
 we
 perish
 and
 Master
 carest
 thou
 not
 that
 we
 perish
 They
 were
 abjectly
 frightened
 and
 at
 least
 partly
 forgetful
 that
 there
 was
 with
 them
 One
 whose
 voice
 even
 death
 had
 to
 obey
 Their
 terrified
 appeal
 was
 not
 wholly
 devoid
 of
 hope
 nor
 barren
 of
 faith
 Lord
 save
 us
 they
 cried
 Calmly
 He
 replied
 to
 their
 piteous
 call
 Why
 are
 ye
 fearful
 O
 ye
 of
 little
 faith
 Then
 He
 arose
 and
 out
 through
 the
 darkness
 of
 that
 fearsome
 night
 into
 the
 roaring
 wind
 over
 the
 stormlashed
 sea
 went
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 Lord
 as
 He
 rebuked
 the
 wind
 and
 said
 unto
 the
 sea
 Peace
 be
 still
 And
 the
 wind
 ceased
 and
 there
 was
 a
 great
 calm
 Turning
 to
 the
 disciples
 He
 asked
 in
 tones
 of
 gentle
 yet
 unmistakable
 reproof
 Where
 is
 your
 faith
 and
 How
 is
 it
 that
 ye
 have
 no
 faith
 Gratitude
 for
 rescue
 from
 what
 but
 a
 moment
 before
 had
 seemed
 impending
 death
 was
 superseded
 by
 amazement
 and
 fear
 What
 manner
 of
 man
 is
 this
 they
 asked
 one
 of
 another
 that
 even
 the
 wind
 and
 the
 sea
 obey
 him
 Among
 the
 recorded
 miracles
 of
 Christ
 none
 has
 elicited
 greater
 diversity
 in
 comment
 and
 in
 attempt
 at
 elucidation
 than
 has
 this
 marvelous
 instance
 of
 control
 over
 the
 forces
 of
 nature
 Science
 ventures
 no
 explanation
 The
 Lord
 of
 earth
 air
 and
 sea
 spoke
 and
 was
 obeyed
 He
 it
 was
 who
 amidst
 the
 black
 chaos
 of
 creations
 earliest
 stages
 had
 commanded
 with
 immediate
 effectLet
 there
 be
 light
 Let
 there
 be
 a
 firmament
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 waters
 Let
 the
 dry
 land
 appearand
 as
 He
 had
 decreed
 so
 it
 was
 The
 dominion
 of
 the
 Creator
 over
 the
 created
 is
 real
 and
 absolute
 A
 small
 part
 of
 that
 dominion
 has
 been
 committed
 to
 man
 as
 the
 offspring
 of
 God
 tabernacled
 in
 the
 very
 image
 of
 his
 divine
 Father
 But
 man
 exercizes
 that
 delegated
 control
 through
 secondary
 agencies
 and
 by
 means
 of
 complicated
 mechanism
 Mans
 power
 over
 the
 objects
 of
 his
 own
 devizing
 is
 limited
 It
 is
 according
 to
 the
 curse
 evoked
 by
 Adams
 fall
 which
 came
 through
 transgression
 that
 by
 the
 strain
 of
 his
 muscles
 by
 the
 sweat
 of
 his
 brow
 and
 by
 stress
 of
 his
 mind
 shall
 he
 achieve
 His
 word
 of
 command
 is
 but
 a
 soundwave
 in
 air
 except
 as
 it
 is
 followed
 by
 labor
 Through
 the
 Spirit
 that
 emanates
 from
 the
 very
 Person
 of
 Deity
 and
 which
 pervades
 all
 space
 the
 command
 of
 God
 is
 immediately
 operative
 Not
 man
 alone
 but
 also
 the
 earth
 and
 all
 the
 elemental
 forces
 pertaining
 thereto
 came
 under
 the
 Adamic
 curse
 and
 as
 the
 soil
 no
 longer
 brought
 forth
 only
 good
 and
 useful
 fruits
 but
 gave
 of
 its
 substance
 to
 nurture
 thorns
 and
 thistles
 so
 the
 several
 forces
 of
 nature
 ceased
 to
 be
 obedient
 to
 man
 as
 agents
 subject
 to
 his
 direct
 control
 What
 we
 call
 natural
 forcesheat
 light
 electricity
 chemical
 affinityare
 but
 a
 few
 of
 the
 manifestations
 of
 eternal
 energy
 through
 which
 the
 Creators
 purposes
 are
 subserved
 and
 these
 few
 man
 is
 able
 to
 direct
 and
 utilize
 only
 through
 mechanical
 contrivance
 and
 physical
 adjustment
 But
 the
 earth
 shall
 yet
 be
 renewed
 and
 receive
 its
 paradisaical
 glory
 then
 soil
 water
 air
 and
 the
 forces
 acting
 upon
 them
 shall
 directly
 respond
 to
 the
 command
 of
 glorified
 man
 as
 now
 they
 obey
 the
 word
 of
 the
 Creator
 QUIETING
 THE
 DEMONS
 Jesus
 and
 the
 disciples
 with
 Him
 landed
 on
 the
 eastern
 or
 Perean
 side
 of
 the
 lake
 in
 a
 region
 known
 as
 the
 country
 of
 the
 Gadarenes
 or
 Gergesenes
 The
 precise
 spot
 has
 not
 been
 identified
 but
 it
 was
 evidently
 a
 country
 district
 apart
 from
 the
 towns
 As
 the
 party
 left
 the
 boat
 two
 maniacs
 who
 were
 sorely
 tormented
 by
 evil
 spirits
 approached
 Matthew
 states
 there
 were
 two
 the
 other
 writers
 speak
 of
 but
 one
 it
 is
 possible
 that
 one
 of
 the
 afflicted
 pair
 was
 in
 a
 condition
 so
 much
 worse
 than
 that
 of
 his
 companion
 that
 to
 him
 is
 accorded
 greater
 prominence
 in
 the
 narrative
 or
 one
 may
 have
 run
 away
 while
 the
 other
 remained
 The
 demoniac
 was
 in
 a
 pitiful
 plight
 His
 frenzy
 had
 become
 so
 violent
 and
 the
 physical
 strength
 incident
 to
 his
 mania
 so
 great
 that
 all
 attempts
 to
 hold
 him
 in
 captivity
 had
 failed
 He
 had
 been
 bound
 in
 chains
 and
 fetters
 but
 these
 he
 had
 broken
 asunder
 by
 the
 aid
 of
 demon
 power
 and
 he
 had
 fled
 to
 the
 mountains
 to
 the
 caverns
 that
 served
 as
 tombs
 and
 there
 he
 had
 lived
 more
 like
 a
 wild
 beast
 than
 a
 man
 Night
 and
 day
 his
 weird
 terrifying
 shrieks
 had
 been
 heard
 and
 through
 dread
 of
 meeting
 him
 people
 traveled
 by
 other
 ways
 rather
 than
 pass
 near
 his
 haunts
 He
 wandered
 about
 naked
 and
 in
 his
 madness
 often
 gashed
 his
 flesh
 with
 sharp
 stones
 Seeing
 Jesus
 the
 poor
 creature
 ran
 toward
 Him
 and
 impelled
 by
 the
 power
 of
 his
 demon
 control
 prostrated
 himself
 before
 Christ
 the
 while
 crying
 out
 with
 a
 loud
 voice
 What
 have
 I
 to
 do
 with
 thee
 Jesus
 thou
 Son
 of
 the
 most
 high
 God
 As
 Jesus
 commanded
 the
 evil
 spirits
 to
 leave
 one
 or
 more
 of
 them
 through
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 man
 pleaded
 to
 be
 left
 alone
 and
 with
 blasphemous
 presumption
 exclaimed
 I
 adjure
 thee
 by
 God
 that
 thou
 torment
 me
 not
 Matthew
 records
 the
 further
 question
 addressed
 to
 Jesus
 Art
 thou
 come
 hither
 to
 torment
 us
 before
 the
 time
 The
 demons
 by
 whom
 the
 man
 was
 possessed
 and
 controlled
 recognized
 the
 Master
 whom
 they
 knew
 they
 had
 to
 obey
 but
 they
 pleaded
 to
 be
 left
 alone
 until
 the
 decreed
 time
 of
 their
 final
 punishment
 would
 come
 Jesus
 asked
 What
 is
 thy
 name
 and
 the
 demons
 within
 the
 man
 answered
 My
 name
 is
 Legion
 for
 we
 are
 many
 The
 fact
 of
 the
 mans
 dual
 consciousness
 or
 multipersonality
 is
 here
 apparent
 So
 complete
 was
 his
 possession
 by
 wicked
 spirits
 that
 he
 could
 no
 longer
 distinguish
 between
 his
 individual
 personality
 and
 theirs
 The
 devils
 implored
 that
 Jesus
 would
 not
 banish
 them
 from
 that
 country
 or
 as
 Luke
 records
 in
 words
 of
 awful
 import
 that
 he
 would
 not
 command
 them
 to
 go
 out
 into
 the
 deep
 In
 their
 wretched
 plight
 and
 out
 of
 diabolical
 eagerness
 to
 find
 abode
 in
 bodies
 of
 flesh
 even
 though
 of
 beasts
 they
 begged
 that
 being
 compelled
 to
 leave
 the
 man
 they
 be
 allowed
 to
 enter
 a
 herd
 of
 hogs
 feeding
 nearby
 Jesus
 gave
 permission
 the
 unclean
 demons
 entered
 the
 swine
 and
 the
 whole
 herd
 numbering
 about
 two
 thousand
 went
 wild
 stampeded
 in
 terror
 ran
 violently
 down
 a
 steep
 place
 into
 the
 sea
 and
 were
 drowned
 The
 swineherds
 were
 frightened
 and
 hastening
 to
 the
 town
 told
 what
 had
 happened
 to
 the
 hogs
 People
 came
 out
 in
 crowds
 to
 see
 for
 themselves
 and
 all
 were
 astounded
 to
 behold
 the
 once
 wild
 man
 of
 whom
 they
 had
 all
 been
 afraid
 now
 clothed
 and
 restored
 to
 a
 normal
 state
 of
 mind
 sitting
 quietly
 and
 reverently
 at
 the
 feet
 of
 Jesus
 They
 were
 afraid
 of
 One
 who
 could
 work
 such
 wonders
 and
 conscious
 of
 their
 sinful
 unworthiness
 begged
 Him
 to
 leave
 their
 country
 The
 man
 who
 had
 been
 rid
 of
 the
 demons
 feared
 not
 in
 his
 heart
 love
 and
 gratitude
 superseded
 all
 other
 feelings
 and
 as
 Jesus
 returned
 to
 the
 boat
 he
 prayed
 that
 he
 might
 go
 also
 But
 Jesus
 forbade
 saying
 Go
 home
 to
 thy
 friends
 and
 tell
 them
 how
 great
 things
 the
 Lord
 hath
 done
 for
 thee
 and
 hath
 had
 compassion
 on
 thee
 The
 man
 became
 a
 missionary
 not
 alone
 in
 his
 home
 town
 but
 throughout
 Decapolis
 the
 region
 of
 the
 ten
 cities
 wherever
 he
 went
 he
 told
 of
 the
 marvelous
 change
 Jesus
 had
 wrought
 on
 him
 The
 testimony
 of
 wicked
 and
 unclean
 spirits
 to
 the
 divinity
 of
 Christ
 as
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 is
 not
 confined
 to
 this
 instance
 We
 have
 already
 considered
 the
 case
 of
 the
 demoniac
 in
 the
 synagog
 at
 Capernaum
 and
 another
 instance
 appeared
 when
 Jesus
 withdrawing
 from
 the
 towns
 in
 Galilee
 betook
 Himself
 to
 the
 sea
 shore
 and
 was
 followed
 by
 a
 great
 multitude
 comprizing
 Galileans
 and
 Judeans
 and
 people
 from
 Jerusalem
 and
 Idumea
 and
 from
 beyond
 Jordan
 ie
 from
 Perea
 and
 inhabitants
 of
 Tyre
 and
 Sidon
 amongst
 whom
 He
 had
 healed
 many
 of
 divers
 diseases
 and
 those
 who
 were
 in
 bondage
 to
 unclean
 spirits
 had
 fallen
 down
 and
 worshiped
 Him
 while
 the
 demons
 cried
 out
 Thou
 art
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 In
 the
 course
 of
 the
 short
 journey
 considered
 in
 this
 chapter
 the
 power
 of
 Jesus
 as
 Master
 of
 earth
 men
 and
 devils
 was
 manifest
 in
 miraculous
 works
 of
 the
 most
 impressive
 kind
 We
 cannot
 classify
 the
 Lords
 miracles
 as
 small
 and
 great
 nor
 as
 easy
 and
 difficult
 of
 accomplishment
 what
 one
 may
 consider
 the
 least
 is
 to
 another
 of
 profound
 import
 The
 Lords
 word
 was
 sufficient
 in
 every
 instance
 To
 the
 wind
 and
 the
 waves
 and
 to
 the
 demonridden
 mind
 of
 the
 man
 possessed
 He
 had
 but
 to
 speak
 and
 be
 obeyed
 Peace
 be
 still
 THE
 RAISING
 OF
 THE
 DAUGHTER
 OF
 JAIRUS
 Jesus
 and
 His
 attendants
 recrossed
 the
 lake
 from
 the
 land
 of
 Gadara
 to
 the
 vicinity
 of
 Capernaum
 where
 He
 was
 received
 with
 acclamation
 by
 a
 multitude
 of
 people
 for
 they
 were
 all
 waiting
 for
 him
 Immediately
 after
 landing
 Jesus
 was
 approached
 by
 Jairus
 one
 of
 the
 rulers
 of
 the
 local
 synagog
 who
 besought
 him
 greatly
 saying
 My
 little
 daughter
 lieth
 at
 the
 point
 of
 death
 I
 pray
 thee
 come
 and
 lay
 thy
 hands
 on
 her
 that
 she
 may
 be
 healed
 and
 she
 shall
 live
 The
 fact
 of
 this
 mans
 coming
 to
 Jesus
 with
 the
 spirit
 of
 faith
 and
 supplication
 is
 an
 evidence
 of
 the
 deep
 impression
 the
 ministry
 of
 Christ
 had
 made
 even
 in
 priestly
 and
 ecclesiastical
 circles
 Many
 of
 the
 Jews
 rulers
 and
 officials
 as
 well
 as
 the
 people
 in
 common
 believed
 in
 Jesus
 though
 few
 belonging
 to
 the
 upper
 classes
 were
 willing
 to
 sacrifice
 prestige
 and
 popularity
 by
 acknowledging
 their
 discipleship
 That
 Jairus
 one
 of
 the
 rulers
 of
 the
 synagog
 came
 only
 when
 impelled
 by
 grief
 over
 the
 impending
 death
 of
 his
 only
 daughter
 a
 girl
 of
 twelve
 years
 is
 no
 evidence
 that
 he
 had
 not
 before
 become
 a
 believer
 certainly
 at
 this
 time
 his
 faith
 was
 genuine
 and
 his
 trust
 sincere
 as
 the
 circumstances
 of
 the
 narrative
 prove
 He
 approached
 Jesus
 with
 the
 reverence
 due
 One
 whom
 he
 considered
 able
 to
 grant
 what
 he
 asked
 and
 fell
 at
 the
 Lords
 feet
 or
 as
 Matthew
 says
 worshiped
 Him
 When
 the
 man
 had
 started
 from
 his
 home
 to
 seek
 aid
 of
 Jesus
 the
 maiden
 was
 at
 the
 point
 of
 death
 he
 feared
 lest
 she
 had
 died
 in
 the
 interval
 In
 the
 very
 brief
 account
 given
 in
 the
 first
 Gospel
 he
 is
 reported
 as
 saying
 to
 Jesus
 My
 daughter
 is
 even
 now
 dead
 but
 come
 and
 lay
 thy
 hand
 upon
 her
 and
 she
 shall
 live
 Jesus
 went
 with
 the
 imploring
 father
 and
 many
 followed
 On
 the
 way
 to
 the
 house
 an
 incident
 occurred
 to
 hinder
 progress
 A
 sorely
 afflicted
 woman
 was
 healed
 under
 circumstances
 of
 peculiar
 interest
 this
 occurrence
 we
 shall
 consider
 presently
 No
 intimation
 is
 given
 that
 Jairus
 showed
 impatience
 or
 displeasure
 over
 the
 delay
 he
 had
 placed
 trust
 in
 the
 Master
 and
 awaited
 His
 time
 and
 pleasure
 and
 while
 Christ
 was
 engaged
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 the
 suffering
 woman
 messengers
 came
 from
 the
 rulers
 house
 with
 the
 saddening
 word
 that
 the
 girl
 was
 dead
 We
 may
 infer
 that
 even
 these
 dread
 tidings
 of
 certainty
 failed
 to
 destroy
 the
 mans
 faith
 he
 seems
 to
 have
 still
 looked
 to
 the
 Lord
 for
 help
 and
 those
 who
 had
 brought
 the
 message
 asked
 Why
 troublest
 thou
 the
 Master
 any
 further
 Jesus
 heard
 what
 was
 said
 and
 sustained
 the
 mans
 sorelytaxed
 faith
 by
 the
 encouraging
 behest
 Be
 not
 afraid
 only
 believe
 Jesus
 permitted
 none
 of
 His
 followers
 save
 three
 of
 the
 apostles
 to
 enter
 the
 house
 with
 Himself
 and
 the
 bereaved
 but
 trusting
 father
 Peter
 and
 the
 two
 brothers
 James
 and
 John
 were
 admitted
 The
 house
 was
 no
 place
 of
 such
 respectful
 silence
 or
 subdued
 quiet
 as
 we
 now
 consider
 appropriate
 to
 the
 time
 and
 place
 of
 death
 on
 the
 contrary
 it
 was
 a
 scene
 of
 tumult
 but
 that
 condition
 was
 customary
 in
 the
 orthodox
 observances
 of
 mourning
 at
 the
 time
 Professional
 mourners
 including
 singers
 of
 weird
 dirges
 and
 minstrels
 who
 made
 great
 noise
 with
 flutes
 and
 other
 instruments
 had
 already
 been
 summoned
 to
 the
 house
 To
 all
 such
 Jesus
 said
 on
 entering
 Why
 make
 ye
 this
 ado
 and
 weep
 the
 damsel
 is
 not
 dead
 but
 sleepeth
 It
 was
 in
 effect
 a
 repetition
 of
 His
 command
 uttered
 on
 a
 then
 recent
 occasionPeace
 be
 still
 His
 words
 drew
 scorn
 and
 ridicule
 from
 those
 who
 were
 paid
 for
 the
 noise
 they
 made
 and
 who
 if
 what
 He
 said
 proved
 true
 would
 lose
 this
 opportunity
 of
 professional
 service
 Moreover
 they
 knew
 the
 maid
 was
 dead
 preparations
 for
 the
 funeral
 which
 custom
 required
 should
 follow
 death
 as
 speedily
 as
 possible
 were
 already
 in
 progress
 Jesus
 ordered
 these
 people
 out
 and
 restored
 peace
 to
 the
 house
 He
 then
 entered
 the
 death
 chamber
 accompanied
 only
 by
 the
 three
 apostles
 and
 the
 parents
 of
 the
 girl
 Taking
 the
 dead
 maiden
 by
 the
 hand
 He
 said
 unto
 her
 Talitha
 cumi
 which
 is
 being
 interpreted
 Damsel
 I
 say
 unto
 thee
 arise
 To
 the
 astonishment
 of
 all
 but
 the
 Lord
 the
 girl
 arose
 left
 her
 bed
 and
 walked
 Jesus
 directed
 that
 food
 be
 given
 her
 as
 bodily
 needs
 suspended
 by
 death
 had
 returned
 with
 the
 girls
 renewal
 of
 life
 The
 Lord
 imposed
 an
 obligation
 of
 secrecy
 charging
 all
 present
 to
 refrain
 from
 telling
 what
 they
 had
 seen
 The
 reasons
 for
 this
 injunction
 are
 not
 stated
 In
 some
 other
 instances
 a
 similar
 instruction
 was
 given
 to
 those
 who
 had
 been
 blessed
 by
 Christs
 ministrations
 while
 on
 many
 occasions
 of
 healing
 no
 such
 instructions
 are
 recorded
 and
 in
 one
 case
 at
 least
 the
 man
 who
 had
 been
 relieved
 of
 demons
 was
 told
 to
 go
 and
 tell
 how
 great
 a
 thing
 had
 been
 done
 for
 him
 In
 His
 own
 wisdom
 Christ
 knew
 when
 to
 prudently
 forbid
 and
 when
 to
 permit
 publication
 of
 His
 doings
 Though
 the
 grateful
 parents
 the
 girl
 herself
 and
 the
 three
 apostles
 who
 had
 been
 witnesses
 of
 the
 restoration
 may
 all
 have
 been
 loyal
 to
 the
 Lords
 injunction
 of
 silence
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 maiden
 had
 been
 raised
 to
 life
 could
 not
 be
 kept
 secret
 and
 the
 means
 by
 which
 so
 great
 a
 wonder
 had
 been
 wrought
 would
 certainly
 be
 inquired
 into
 The
 minstrels
 and
 the
 wailers
 who
 had
 been
 expelled
 from
 the
 place
 while
 it
 was
 yet
 a
 house
 of
 mourning
 and
 who
 had
 scornfully
 laughed
 at
 the
 Masters
 assertion
 that
 the
 maiden
 was
 asleep
 and
 not
 dead
 as
 they
 thought
 would
 undoubtedly
 spread
 reports
 It
 is
 not
 surprizing
 therefore
 to
 read
 in
 Matthews
 short
 version
 of
 the
 history
 that
 the
 fame
 of
 the
 miracle
 went
 abroad
 into
 all
 that
 land
 RESTORATION
 TO
 LIFE
 AND
 RESURRECTION
 The
 vital
 distinction
 between
 a
 restoration
 of
 the
 dead
 to
 a
 resumption
 of
 mortal
 life
 and
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 body
 from
 death
 to
 a
 state
 of
 immortality
 must
 be
 thoughtfully
 heeded
 In
 each
 of
 the
 instances
 thus
 far
 consideredthat
 of
 the
 raising
 of
 the
 dead
 man
 of
 Nain
 and
 that
 of
 the
 daughter
 of
 Jairus
 as
 also
 the
 raising
 of
 Lazarus
 to
 be
 studied
 laterthe
 miracle
 consisted
 in
 reuniting
 the
 spirit
 and
 the
 body
 in
 a
 continuation
 of
 the
 interrupted
 course
 of
 mortal
 existence
 That
 the
 subject
 of
 each
 of
 these
 miracles
 had
 to
 subsequently
 die
 is
 certain
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 the
 first
 of
 all
 men
 who
 have
 lived
 on
 earth
 to
 come
 forth
 from
 the
 tomb
 an
 immortalized
 Being
 He
 is
 therefore
 properly
 designated
 as
 the
 first
 fruits
 of
 them
 that
 slept
 Though
 both
 Elijah
 and
 Elisha
 many
 centuries
 prior
 to
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 were
 instrumental
 in
 restoring
 life
 to
 the
 dead
 the
 former
 to
 the
 widows
 son
 in
 Zareptha
 the
 latter
 to
 the
 child
 of
 the
 Shunammite
 woman
 in
 these
 earlier
 miracles
 the
 restoration
 was
 to
 mortal
 existence
 not
 to
 immortality
 It
 is
 instructive
 to
 observe
 the
 difference
 in
 the
 procedure
 of
 each
 of
 the
 Old
 Testament
 prophets
 mentioned
 as
 compared
 with
 that
 of
 Christ
 in
 analogous
 miracles
 By
 both
 Elijah
 and
 Elisha
 the
 wonderful
 change
 was
 brought
 about
 only
 after
 long
 and
 labored
 ministrations
 and
 earnest
 invocation
 of
 the
 power
 and
 intervention
 of
 Jehovah
 but
 Jehovah
 embodied
 in
 flesh
 as
 Jesus
 Christ
 did
 nothing
 outwardly
 but
 command
 and
 the
 bonds
 of
 death
 were
 immediately
 broken
 He
 spoke
 in
 His
 own
 name
 and
 by
 inherent
 authority
 for
 by
 the
 power
 with
 which
 He
 was
 invested
 He
 held
 control
 of
 both
 life
 and
 death
 A
 REMARKABLE
 HEALING
 BY
 THE
 WAY
 While
 Jesus
 was
 walking
 to
 the
 house
 of
 Jairus
 with
 a
 great
 crowd
 of
 people
 thronging
 about
 Him
 the
 progress
 of
 the
 company
 was
 arrested
 by
 another
 case
 of
 suffering
 In
 the
 throng
 was
 a
 woman
 who
 for
 twelve
 years
 had
 been
 afflicted
 with
 a
 serious
 ailment
 involving
 frequent
 hemorrhage
 She
 had
 spent
 in
 medical
 treatment
 all
 she
 had
 owned
 and
 had
 suffered
 many
 things
 of
 many
 physicians
 but
 had
 steadily
 grown
 worse
 She
 worked
 her
 way
 through
 the
 crowd
 and
 approaching
 Jesus
 from
 behind
 touched
 His
 robe
 For
 she
 said
 If
 I
 may
 touch
 but
 his
 clothes
 I
 shall
 be
 whole
 The
 effect
 was
 more
 than
 magical
 immediately
 she
 felt
 the
 thrill
 of
 health
 throughout
 her
 body
 and
 knew
 that
 she
 had
 been
 healed
 of
 her
 affliction
 Her
 object
 attained
 the
 blessing
 she
 sought
 being
 now
 secured
 she
 tried
 to
 escape
 notice
 by
 hastily
 dropping
 back
 into
 the
 crowd
 But
 her
 touch
 was
 not
 unheeded
 by
 the
 Lord
 He
 turned
 to
 look
 over
 the
 throng
 and
 asked
 Who
 touched
 my
 clothes
 or
 as
 Luke
 puts
 it
 Who
 touched
 me
 As
 the
 people
 denied
 the
 impetuous
 Peter
 speaking
 for
 himself
 and
 the
 others
 said
 Master
 the
 multitude
 throng
 thee
 and
 press
 thee
 and
 sayest
 thou
 Who
 touched
 me
 But
 Jesus
 answered
 Somebody
 hath
 touched
 me
 for
 I
 perceive
 that
 virtue
 is
 gone
 out
 of
 me
 The
 woman
 finding
 that
 she
 could
 not
 escape
 identification
 came
 tremblingly
 forward
 and
 kneeling
 before
 the
 Lord
 confessed
 what
 she
 had
 done
 her
 reason
 for
 so
 doing
 and
 the
 beneficent
 result
 If
 she
 had
 expected
 censure
 her
 fears
 were
 promptly
 set
 at
 rest
 for
 Jesus
 addressing
 her
 by
 a
 term
 of
 respect
 and
 kindness
 said
 Daughter
 be
 of
 good
 comfort
 thy
 faith
 hath
 made
 thee
 whole
 go
 in
 peace
 and
 as
 Mark
 adds
 be
 whole
 of
 thy
 plague
 This
 womans
 faith
 was
 sincere
 and
 free
 from
 guile
 nevertheless
 it
 was
 in
 a
 sense
 defective
 She
 believed
 that
 the
 influence
 of
 Christs
 person
 and
 even
 that
 attaching
 to
 His
 raiment
 was
 a
 remedial
 agency
 ample
 to
 cure
 her
 malady
 but
 she
 did
 not
 realize
 that
 the
 power
 to
 heal
 was
 an
 inherent
 attribute
 to
 be
 exercized
 at
 His
 will
 and
 as
 the
 influence
 of
 faith
 might
 call
 it
 forth
 True
 her
 faith
 had
 already
 been
 in
 part
 rewarded
 but
 of
 greater
 worth
 to
 her
 than
 the
 physical
 cure
 of
 her
 illness
 would
 be
 the
 assurance
 that
 the
 divine
 Healer
 had
 granted
 the
 desire
 of
 her
 heart
 and
 that
 the
 faith
 she
 had
 manifested
 was
 accepted
 by
 Him
 To
 correct
 her
 misapprehension
 and
 to
 confirm
 her
 faith
 Jesus
 gently
 subjected
 her
 to
 the
 necessary
 ordeal
 of
 confession
 which
 must
 have
 been
 made
 easier
 through
 her
 consciousness
 of
 the
 great
 relief
 already
 experienced
 He
 confirmed
 the
 healing
 and
 let
 her
 depart
 with
 the
 comforting
 assurance
 that
 her
 recovery
 was
 permanent
 In
 contrast
 with
 the
 many
 cases
 of
 healing
 in
 connection
 with
 which
 the
 Lord
 charged
 the
 beneficiaries
 that
 they
 should
 tell
 none
 how
 or
 by
 whom
 they
 had
 been
 relieved
 we
 see
 here
 that
 publicity
 was
 made
 sure
 by
 His
 own
 action
 and
 that
 too
 when
 secrecy
 was
 desired
 by
 the
 recipient
 of
 the
 blessing
 The
 purposes
 and
 motives
 of
 Jesus
 may
 be
 but
 poorly
 understood
 by
 man
 but
 in
 this
 womans
 case
 we
 see
 the
 possibility
 of
 stories
 strange
 and
 untrue
 getting
 afloat
 and
 it
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 the
 wiser
 course
 to
 make
 plain
 the
 truth
 then
 and
 there
 Moreover
 the
 spiritual
 worth
 of
 the
 miracle
 was
 greatly
 enhanced
 by
 the
 womans
 confession
 and
 by
 the
 Lords
 gracious
 assurance
 Observe
 the
 significant
 assertion
 Thy
 faith
 hath
 made
 thee
 whole
 Faith
 is
 of
 itself
 a
 principle
 of
 power
 and
 by
 its
 presence
 or
 absence
 by
 its
 fulness
 or
 paucity
 even
 the
 Lord
 was
 and
 is
 influenced
 and
 in
 great
 measure
 controlled
 in
 the
 bestowal
 or
 withholding
 of
 blessings
 for
 He
 ministers
 according
 to
 law
 and
 not
 with
 caprice
 or
 uncertainty
 We
 read
 that
 at
 a
 certain
 time
 and
 place
 Jesus
 could
 there
 do
 no
 mighty
 work
 because
 of
 the
 peoples
 unbelief
 Modern
 revelation
 specifies
 that
 faith
 to
 be
 healed
 is
 one
 of
 the
 gifts
 of
 the
 Spirit
 analogous
 to
 the
 manifestations
 of
 faith
 in
 the
 work
 of
 healing
 others
 through
 the
 exercize
 of
 the
 power
 of
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 Our
 Lords
 inquiry
 as
 to
 who
 had
 touched
 Him
 in
 the
 throng
 affords
 us
 another
 example
 of
 His
 asking
 questions
 in
 pursuance
 of
 a
 purpose
 when
 He
 could
 readily
 have
 determined
 the
 facts
 directly
 and
 without
 aid
 from
 others
 There
 was
 a
 special
 purpose
 in
 the
 question
 as
 every
 teacher
 finds
 a
 means
 of
 instruction
 in
 questioning
 his
 pupils
 But
 there
 is
 in
 Christs
 question
 Who
 touched
 me
 a
 deeper
 significance
 than
 could
 inhere
 in
 a
 simple
 inquiry
 as
 to
 the
 identity
 of
 an
 individual
 and
 this
 is
 implied
 in
 the
 Lords
 further
 words
 Somebody
 hath
 touched
 me
 for
 I
 perceive
 that
 virtue
 is
 gone
 out
 of
 me
 The
 usual
 external
 act
 by
 which
 His
 miracles
 were
 wrought
 was
 a
 word
 or
 a
 command
 sometimes
 accompanied
 by
 the
 laying
 on
 of
 hands
 or
 by
 some
 other
 physical
 ministration
 as
 in
 anointing
 the
 eyes
 of
 a
 blind
 man
 That
 there
 was
 an
 actual
 giving
 of
 His
 own
 strength
 to
 the
 afflicted
 whom
 He
 healed
 is
 evident
 from
 the
 present
 instance
 Passive
 belief
 on
 the
 part
 of
 a
 wouldbe
 recipient
 of
 blessing
 is
 insufficient
 only
 when
 it
 is
 vitalized
 into
 active
 faith
 is
 it
 a
 power
 so
 also
 of
 one
 who
 ministers
 in
 the
 authority
 given
 of
 God
 mental
 and
 spiritual
 energy
 must
 be
 operative
 if
 the
 service
 is
 to
 be
 effective
 THE
 BLIND
 SEE
 AND
 THE
 DUMB
 SPEAK
 Two
 other
 instances
 of
 miraculous
 healing
 are
 chronicled
 by
 Matthew
 as
 closely
 following
 the
 raising
 of
 the
 daughter
 of
 Jairus
 As
 Jesus
 passed
 down
 the
 streets
 of
 Capernaum
 presumably
 on
 His
 departure
 from
 the
 house
 of
 the
 ruler
 of
 the
 synagog
 two
 blind
 men
 followed
 Him
 crying
 out
 Thou
 son
 of
 David
 have
 mercy
 on
 us
 This
 title
 of
 address
 was
 voiced
 by
 others
 at
 sundry
 times
 and
 in
 no
 case
 do
 we
 find
 record
 of
 our
 Lord
 disclaiming
 it
 or
 objecting
 to
 its
 use
 Jesus
 paused
 not
 to
 heed
 this
 call
 of
 the
 blind
 and
 the
 two
 sightless
 men
 followed
 Him
 even
 entering
 the
 house
 after
 Him
 Then
 He
 spoke
 to
 them
 asking
 Believe
 ye
 that
 I
 am
 able
 to
 do
 this
 And
 they
 replied
 Yea
 Lord
 Their
 persistency
 in
 following
 the
 Lord
 was
 evidence
 of
 their
 belief
 that
 in
 some
 way
 though
 to
 them
 unknown
 and
 mysterious
 He
 could
 help
 them
 and
 they
 promptly
 and
 openly
 confessed
 that
 belief
 Our
 Lord
 touched
 their
 eyes
 saying
 According
 to
 your
 faith
 be
 it
 unto
 you
 The
 effect
 was
 immediate
 their
 eyes
 were
 opened
 They
 were
 explicitly
 instructed
 to
 say
 nothing
 of
 the
 matter
 to
 others
 but
 rejoicing
 in
 the
 inestimable
 blessing
 of
 sight
 they
 spread
 abroad
 his
 fame
 in
 all
 that
 country
 So
 far
 as
 we
 can
 unravel
 the
 uncertain
 threads
 of
 sequence
 in
 the
 works
 of
 Christ
 this
 is
 the
 earliest
 instance
 recorded
 with
 attendant
 details
 of
 His
 giving
 sight
 to
 the
 blind
 Many
 remarkable
 cases
 follow
 It
 is
 worthy
 of
 note
 that
 in
 blessing
 the
 sightless
 by
 the
 exercize
 of
 His
 healing
 power
 Jesus
 usually
 ministered
 by
 some
 physical
 contact
 in
 addition
 to
 uttering
 the
 authoritative
 words
 of
 command
 or
 assurance
 In
 this
 instance
 as
 also
 in
 that
 of
 two
 blind
 men
 who
 sat
 by
 the
 wayside
 He
 touched
 the
 sightless
 eyes
 in
 the
 giving
 of
 sight
 to
 the
 blind
 indigent
 in
 Jerusalem
 He
 anointed
 the
 mans
 eyes
 with
 clay
 to
 the
 eyes
 of
 another
 He
 applied
 saliva
 An
 analogous
 circumstance
 is
 found
 in
 the
 healing
 of
 one
 who
 was
 deaf
 and
 defective
 of
 speech
 in
 which
 instance
 the
 Lord
 put
 His
 fingers
 into
 the
 mans
 ears
 and
 touched
 his
 tongue
 In
 no
 case
 can
 such
 treatment
 be
 regarded
 as
 medicinal
 or
 therapeutic
 Christ
 was
 not
 a
 physician
 who
 relied
 upon
 curative
 substances
 nor
 a
 surgeon
 to
 perform
 physical
 operations
 His
 healings
 were
 the
 natural
 results
 of
 the
 application
 of
 a
 power
 of
 His
 own
 It
 is
 conceivable
 that
 confidence
 which
 is
 a
 steppingstone
 to
 belief
 as
 that
 in
 turn
 is
 to
 faith
 may
 have
 been
 encouraged
 by
 these
 physical
 ministrations
 strengthened
 and
 advanced
 to
 a
 higher
 and
 more
 abiding
 trust
 in
 Christ
 on
 the
 part
 of
 the
 afflicted
 who
 had
 not
 sight
 to
 look
 upon
 the
 Masters
 face
 and
 derive
 inspiration
 therefrom
 nor
 hearing
 to
 hear
 His
 uplifting
 words
 There
 is
 apparent
 not
 alone
 an
 entire
 absence
 of
 formula
 and
 formalism
 in
 His
 ministration
 but
 a
 lack
 of
 uniformity
 of
 procedure
 quite
 as
 impressive
 As
 the
 two
 men
 once
 sightless
 but
 now
 seeing
 departed
 others
 came
 bringing
 a
 dumb
 friend
 whose
 affliction
 seems
 to
 have
 been
 primarily
 due
 to
 the
 malignant
 influence
 of
 an
 evil
 spirit
 rather
 than
 to
 any
 organic
 defect
 Jesus
 rebuked
 the
 wicked
 spiritcast
 out
 the
 demon
 that
 had
 obsessed
 the
 afflicted
 one
 and
 held
 him
 in
 the
 tyranny
 of
 speechlessness
 The
 mans
 tongue
 was
 loosened
 he
 was
 freed
 from
 the
 evil
 incubus
 and
 was
 no
 longer
 dumb

 Storms
 on
 the
 Lake
 of
 GalileeIt
 is
 a
 matter
 of
 record
 that
 sudden
 and
 violent
 storms
 are
 common
 on
 the
 lake
 or
 sea
 of
 Galilee
 and
 the
 tempest
 that
 was
 quieted
 by
 the
 Lords
 word
 of
 command
 was
 of
 itself
 no
 unusual
 phenomenon
 except
 perhaps
 in
 its
 intensity
 Another
 incident
 connected
 with
 a
 storm
 on
 this
 small
 body
 of
 water
 is
 of
 scriptural
 record
 and
 will
 be
 considered
 later
 in
 the
 text
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 John
 
 Dr
 Thompson
 The
 Land
 and
 the
 Book
 ii
 gives
 a
 description
 founded
 on
 his
 personal
 experience
 on
 the
 shores
 of
 the
 lake
 I
 spent
 a
 night
 in
 that
 Wady
 Shukaiyif
 some
 three
 miles
 up
 it
 to
 the
 left
 of
 us
 The
 sun
 had
 scarcely
 set
 when
 the
 wind
 began
 to
 rush
 down
 toward
 the
 lake
 and
 it
 continued
 all
 night
 long
 with
 constantly
 increasing
 violence
 so
 that
 when
 we
 reached
 the
 shore
 next
 morning
 the
 face
 of
 the
 lake
 was
 a
 huge
 boiling
 caldron
 The
 wind
 howled
 down
 every
 wady
 from
 the
 northeast
 and
 east
 with
 such
 fury
 that
 no
 efforts
 of
 rowers
 could
 have
 brought
 a
 boat
 to
 shore
 at
 any
 point
 along
 that
 coast
 To
 understand
 the
 causes
 of
 these
 sudden
 and
 violent
 tempests
 we
 must
 remember
 that
 the
 lake
 lies
 lowsix
 hundred
 feet
 lower
 than
 the
 ocean
 that
 the
 vast
 and
 naked
 plateaus
 of
 the
 Jaulan
 rise
 to
 a
 great
 height
 spreading
 backward
 to
 the
 wilds
 of
 the
 Hauran
 and
 upward
 to
 snowy
 Hermon
 and
 the
 watercourses
 have
 cut
 out
 profound
 ravines
 and
 wild
 gorges
 converging
 to
 the
 head
 of
 this
 lake
 and
 that
 these
 act
 like
 gigantic
 funnels
 to
 draw
 down
 the
 cold
 winds
 from
 the
 mountains
 
 The
 Earth
 Before
 and
 After
 Its
 RegenerationThat
 the
 earth
 itself
 fell
 under
 the
 curse
 incident
 to
 the
 fall
 of
 the
 first
 parents
 of
 the
 race
 and
 that
 even
 as
 man
 shall
 be
 redeemed
 so
 shall
 the
 earth
 be
 regenerated
 is
 implied
 in
 Pauls
 words
 Because
 the
 creature
 itself
 also
 shall
 be
 delivered
 from
 the
 bondage
 of
 corruption
 into
 the
 glorious
 liberty
 of
 the
 children
 of
 God
 For
 we
 know
 that
 the
 whole
 Creation
 groaneth
 and
 travaileth
 in
 pain
 together
 until
 now
 And
 not
 only
 they
 but
 ourselves
 also
 which
 have
 the
 firstfruits
 of
 the
 Spirit
 even
 we
 ourselves
 groan
 within
 ourselves
 waiting
 for
 the
 adoption
 to
 wit
 the
 redemption
 of
 our
 body
 Rom
 
 The
 present
 author
 has
 written
 elsewhere
 According
 to
 the
 scriptures
 the
 earth
 has
 to
 undergo
 a
 change
 analogous
 to
 death
 and
 to
 be
 regenerated
 in
 a
 manner
 comparable
 to
 a
 resurrection
 References
 to
 the
 elements
 melting
 with
 heat
 and
 to
 the
 earth
 being
 consumed
 and
 passing
 away
 such
 as
 occur
 in
 many
 scriptures
 already
 cited
 are
 suggestive
 of
 death
 and
 the
 new
 earth
 really
 the
 renewed
 or
 regenerated
 planet
 which
 is
 to
 result
 may
 be
 compared
 with
 a
 resurrected
 organism
 The
 change
 has
 been
 likened
 unto
 a
 transfiguration
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 
 Every
 created
 thing
 has
 been
 made
 for
 a
 purpose
 and
 everything
 that
 fills
 the
 measure
 of
 its
 creation
 is
 to
 be
 advanced
 in
 the
 scale
 of
 progression
 be
 it
 an
 atom
 or
 a
 world
 an
 animalcule
 or
 manthe
 direct
 and
 literal
 offspring
 of
 Deity
 In
 speaking
 of
 the
 degrees
 of
 glory
 provided
 for
 His
 creations
 and
 of
 the
 laws
 of
 regeneration
 and
 sanctification
 the
 Lord
 in
 a
 revelation
 dated
 
 speaks
 plainly
 of
 the
 approaching
 death
 and
 subsequent
 quickening
 of
 the
 earth
 These
 are
 his
 wordsAnd
 again
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 the
 earth
 abideth
 the
 law
 of
 a
 celestial
 kingdom
 for
 it
 filleth
 the
 measure
 of
 its
 creation
 and
 transgresseth
 not
 the
 law
 Wherefore
 it
 shall
 be
 sanctified
 yea
 notwithstanding
 it
 shall
 die
 it
 shall
 be
 quickened
 again
 and
 shall
 abide
 the
 power
 by
 which
 it
 is
 quickened
 and
 the
 righteous
 shall
 inherit
 it

 The
 vital
 Spirit
 that
 emanates
 from
 God
 and
 is
 coextensive
 with
 space
 may
 operate
 directly
 and
 with
 as
 positive
 effect
 upon
 inanimate
 things
 and
 upon
 energy
 in
 its
 diverse
 manifestations
 known
 to
 us
 as
 the
 forces
 of
 nature
 as
 upon
 organized
 intelligences
 whether
 yet
 unembodied
 in
 the
 flesh
 or
 disembodied
 Thus
 the
 Lord
 may
 speak
 directly
 to
 the
 earth
 the
 air
 the
 sea
 and
 be
 heard
 and
 obeyed
 for
 the
 divine
 affluence
 which
 is
 the
 sum
 of
 all
 energy
 and
 power
 may
 and
 does
 operate
 throughout
 the
 universe
 In
 the
 course
 of
 a
 revelation
 from
 God
 to
 Enoch
 the
 earth
 is
 personified
 and
 her
 groans
 and
 lamentations
 over
 the
 wickedness
 of
 men
 were
 heard
 by
 the
 prophet
 And
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 that
 Enoch
 looked
 upon
 the
 earth
 and
 he
 heard
 a
 voice
 from
 the
 bowels
 thereof
 saying
 Wo
 wo
 is
 me
 the
 mother
 of
 men
 I
 am
 pained
 I
 am
 weary
 because
 of
 the
 wickedness
 of
 my
 children
 When
 shall
 I
 rest
 and
 be
 cleansed
 from
 the
 filthiness
 which
 is
 gone
 forth
 out
 of
 me
 When
 will
 my
 Creator
 sanctify
 me
 that
 I
 may
 rest
 and
 righteousness
 for
 a
 season
 abide
 upon
 my
 face
 Enoch
 pleaded
 O
 Lord
 wilt
 thou
 not
 have
 compassion
 upon
 the
 earth
 Following
 further
 revelation
 as
 to
 the
 then
 future
 course
 of
 mankind
 in
 sin
 and
 in
 the
 rejection
 of
 the
 Messiah
 who
 was
 to
 be
 sent
 the
 prophet
 wept
 with
 anguish
 and
 asked
 of
 God
 When
 shall
 the
 earth
 rest
 It
 was
 then
 shown
 unto
 him
 that
 the
 crucified
 Christ
 shall
 return
 to
 earth
 and
 establish
 a
 millennial
 reign
 of
 peace
 And
 the
 Lord
 said
 unto
 Enoch
 As
 I
 live
 even
 so
 will
 I
 come
 in
 the
 last
 days
 in
 the
 days
 of
 wickedness
 and
 vengeance
 to
 fulfil
 the
 oath
 which
 I
 have
 made
 unto
 you
 concerning
 the
 children
 of
 Noah
 and
 the
 day
 shall
 come
 that
 the
 earth
 shall
 rest
 but
 before
 that
 day
 the
 heavens
 shall
 be
 darkened
 and
 a
 veil
 of
 darkness
 shall
 cover
 the
 earth
 and
 the
 heavens
 shall
 shake
 and
 also
 the
 earth
 and
 great
 tribulations
 shall
 be
 among
 the
 children
 of
 men
 And
 the
 glorious
 assurance
 followed
 that
 for
 the
 space
 of
 a
 thousand
 years
 the
 earth
 shall
 rest

 A
 partial
 description
 of
 the
 earth
 in
 its
 regenerated
 state
 has
 been
 given
 through
 the
 prophet
 Joseph
 Smith
 in
 the
 present
 dispensation
 This
 earth
 in
 its
 sanctified
 and
 immortal
 state
 will
 be
 made
 like
 unto
 crystal
 and
 will
 be
 a
 Urim
 and
 Thummim
 to
 the
 inhabitants
 who
 dwell
 thereon
 whereby
 all
 things
 pertaining
 to
 an
 inferior
 kingdom
 or
 all
 kingdoms
 of
 a
 lower
 order
 will
 be
 manifest
 to
 those
 who
 dwell
 on
 it
 and
 this
 earth
 will
 be
 Christs
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 That
 Jesus
 Christ
 in
 the
 exercize
 of
 His
 powers
 of
 Godship
 should
 speak
 directly
 to
 the
 wind
 or
 the
 sea
 and
 be
 obeyed
 is
 no
 less
 truly
 in
 accord
 with
 the
 natural
 law
 of
 heaven
 than
 that
 He
 should
 effectively
 command
 a
 man
 or
 an
 unembodied
 spirit
 That
 through
 faith
 even
 mortal
 man
 may
 set
 in
 operation
 the
 forces
 that
 act
 upon
 matter
 and
 with
 assurance
 of
 stupendous
 results
 has
 been
 explicitly
 declared
 by
 Jesus
 Christ
 For
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 If
 ye
 have
 faith
 as
 a
 grain
 of
 mustard
 seed
 ye
 shall
 say
 unto
 this
 mountain
 Remove
 hence
 to
 yonder
 place
 and
 it
 shill
 remove
 and
 nothing
 shall
 be
 impossible
 unto
 you

 The
 Land
 of
 the
 GergesenesAttempts
 have
 been
 made
 to
 discredit
 the
 account
 of
 Christs
 healing
 the
 demoniac
 in
 the
 country
 of
 the
 Gadarenes
 Mark
 
 Luke
 
 on
 the
 claim
 that
 the
 ancient
 town
 of
 Gadara
 the
 capital
 of
 the
 district
 see
 Josephus
 Wars
 iii
 
 was
 too
 far
 inland
 to
 make
 possible
 the
 precipitous
 dash
 of
 the
 swine
 into
 the
 sea
 from
 that
 place
 Others
 lay
 stress
 on
 the
 fact
 that
 Matthew
 differs
 from
 the
 two
 other
 Gospelhistorians
 in
 specifying
 the
 country
 of
 the
 Gergesenes
 
 As
 stated
 in
 the
 text
 a
 whole
 region
 or
 section
 is
 referred
 to
 not
 a
 town
 The
 keepers
 of
 the
 swine
 ran
 off
 to
 the
 towns
 to
 report
 the
 disaster
 that
 had
 befallen
 their
 herd
 In
 that
 district
 of
 Perea
 there
 were
 at
 the
 time
 towns
 named
 respectively
 Gadara
 Gerasa
 and
 Gergesa
 the
 region
 in
 general
 therefore
 could
 properly
 be
 called
 the
 land
 of
 the
 Gadarenes
 or
 of
 the
 Gergesenes
 Farrar
 Life
 of
 Christ
 p
 
 note
 says
 After
 the
 researches
 of
 Dr
 Thompson
 The
 Land
 and
 the
 Book
 ii
 there
 can
 be
 no
 doubt
 that
 Gergesa
 
 was
 the
 name
 of
 a
 little
 town
 nearly
 opposite
 Capernaum
 the
 ruined
 site
 of
 which
 is
 still
 called
 Kerza
 or
 Gersa
 by
 the
 Bedawin
 The
 existence
 of
 this
 little
 town
 was
 apparently
 known
 both
 to
 Origen
 who
 first
 introduced
 the
 reading
 and
 to
 Eusebius
 and
 Jerome
 and
 in
 their
 day
 a
 steep
 declivity
 near
 it
 where
 the
 hills
 approach
 to
 within
 a
 little
 distance
 from
 the
 lake
 was
 pointed
 out
 as
 the
 scene
 of
 the
 miracle
 
 Jesus
 Entreated
 to
 Leave
 the
 CountryThe
 people
 were
 frightened
 over
 the
 power
 possessed
 by
 Jesus
 as
 demonstrated
 in
 the
 cure
 of
 the
 demoniac
 and
 in
 the
 destruction
 of
 the
 swine
 which
 latter
 occurrence
 however
 was
 not
 in
 pursuance
 of
 His
 command
 It
 was
 the
 fear
 that
 sinful
 men
 feel
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 Righteous
 They
 were
 not
 prepared
 for
 other
 manifestations
 of
 divine
 power
 and
 they
 dreaded
 to
 think
 who
 among
 them
 might
 be
 directly
 affected
 thereby
 should
 it
 be
 exerted
 We
 must
 judge
 the
 people
 mercifully
 however
 if
 at
 all
 They
 were
 in
 part
 heathen
 and
 had
 but
 superstitious
 conceptions
 of
 Deity
 Their
 prayer
 that
 Jesus
 leave
 them
 brings
 to
 mind
 the
 ejaculation
 of
 Simon
 Peter
 in
 his
 witnessing
 one
 of
 Christs
 miracles
 Depart
 from
 me
 for
 I
 am
 a
 sinful
 man
 O
 Lord
 Luke
 
 
 Dead
 or
 At
 the
 Point
 of
 DeathAccording
 to
 Luke
 
 the
 daughter
 of
 Jairus
 lay
 a
 dying
 when
 the
 griefstricken
 father
 sought
 help
 of
 the
 Lord
 Mark
 
 reports
 the
 man
 as
 stating
 that
 the
 girl
 lay
 at
 the
 point
 of
 death
 These
 two
 accounts
 agree
 but
 Matthew
 
 represents
 the
 father
 as
 saying
 My
 daughter
 is
 even
 now
 dead
 Unbelieving
 critics
 have
 dwelt
 at
 length
 on
 what
 they
 designate
 an
 inconsistency
 if
 not
 a
 contradiction
 in
 these
 versions
 and
 yet
 both
 accounts
 embodied
 in
 the
 three
 records
 are
 plainly
 true
 The
 maid
 was
 seemingly
 breathing
 her
 last
 she
 was
 in
 the
 very
 throes
 of
 death
 when
 the
 father
 hurried
 away
 Before
 he
 met
 Jesus
 he
 felt
 that
 the
 end
 had
 probably
 come
 nevertheless
 his
 faith
 endured
 His
 words
 attest
 his
 trust
 that
 even
 had
 his
 daughter
 actually
 died
 since
 he
 left
 her
 side
 the
 Master
 could
 recall
 her
 to
 life
 He
 was
 in
 a
 state
 of
 frenzied
 grief
 and
 still
 his
 faith
 held
 true
 
 Mourning
 Customs
 Among
 OrientalsObservances
 that
 to
 us
 seem
 strange
 weird
 and
 out
 of
 place
 prevailed
 from
 very
 early
 times
 among
 oriental
 peoples
 some
 of
 which
 customs
 were
 common
 to
 the
 Jews
 in
 the
 days
 of
 Christ
 Noise
 and
 tumult
 including
 screeching
 lamentations
 by
 members
 of
 the
 bereaved
 family
 and
 by
 professional
 mourners
 as
 also
 the
 din
 of
 instruments
 were
 usual
 accompaniments
 of
 mourning
 Geikie
 citing
 Buxtorfs
 quotation
 from
 the
 Talmud
 gives
 place
 to
 the
 following
 Even
 a
 poor
 Israelite
 was
 required
 to
 have
 not
 fewer
 than
 two
 flute
 players
 and
 one
 mourning
 woman
 at
 the
 death
 of
 his
 wife
 but
 if
 he
 be
 rich
 all
 things
 are
 to
 be
 done
 according
 to
 his
 quality
 In
 Smiths
 Dictionary
 of
 the
 Bible
 we
 read
 The
 number
 of
 words
 about
 eleven
 Hebrew
 and
 as
 many
 Greek
 employed
 in
 scripture
 to
 express
 the
 various
 actions
 characteristic
 of
 mourning
 shows
 in
 a
 great
 degree
 the
 nature
 of
 Jewish
 customs
 in
 this
 respect
 They
 appear
 to
 have
 consisted
 chiefly
 in
 the
 following
 particulars
 
 Beating
 upon
 the
 breast
 or
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 body
 
 Weeping
 and
 screaming
 in
 an
 excessive
 degree
 
 Wearing
 sadcolored
 garments
 
 Songs
 of
 lamentation
 
 Funeral
 feasts
 
 Employment
 of
 persons
 especially
 women
 to
 lament
 One
 marked
 feature
 of
 oriental
 mourning
 is
 what
 may
 be
 called
 its
 studied
 publicity
 and
 the
 careful
 observance
 of
 prescribed
 ceremonies
 Gen
 
 Job
 
 
 Isa
 
 etc
 
 Not
 Dead
 but
 SleepethThat
 the
 daughter
 of
 Jairus
 was
 dead
 is
 placed
 beyond
 reasonable
 doubt
 by
 the
 scriptural
 record
 Our
 Lords
 statement
 to
 the
 noisy
 mourners
 that
 the
 damsel
 is
 not
 dead
 but
 sleepeth
 told
 that
 her
 sleep
 was
 to
 be
 of
 short
 duration
 It
 was
 a
 rabbinical
 and
 common
 custom
 of
 the
 time
 to
 speak
 of
 death
 as
 a
 sleep
 and
 those
 who
 laughed
 Jesus
 to
 scorn
 for
 His
 statement
 chose
 to
 construe
 His
 words
 in
 a
 sense
 of
 such
 literalism
 as
 the
 context
 scarcely
 warrants
 It
 is
 noticeable
 that
 the
 Lord
 used
 a
 strictly
 equivalent
 expression
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 death
 of
 Lazarus
 Our
 friend
 Lazarus
 sleepeth
 said
 He
 but
 I
 go
 that
 I
 may
 awake
 him
 out
 of
 sleep
 The
 literal
 construction
 placed
 upon
 these
 words
 by
 the
 apostles
 evoked
 the
 plain
 declaration
 Lazarus
 is
 dead
 John
 
 
 In
 the
 Talmud
 death
 is
 repeatedly
 designated
 as
 sleephundreds
 of
 times
 says
 Lightfoot
 a
 recognized
 authority
 on
 Hebrew
 literature
 
 Why
 Did
 Jesus
 Make
 InquiriesWe
 have
 already
 considered
 many
 instances
 of
 Christs
 possession
 of
 what
 man
 would
 call
 superhuman
 knowledge
 extending
 even
 to
 the
 reading
 of
 unuttered
 thoughts
 Some
 people
 find
 difficulty
 in
 reconciling
 this
 superior
 quality
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 Jesus
 often
 asked
 questions
 even
 on
 matters
 of
 minor
 circumstance
 We
 should
 realize
 that
 even
 complete
 knowledge
 may
 not
 preclude
 the
 propriety
 of
 making
 inquiries
 and
 moreover
 that
 even
 omniscience
 does
 not
 imply
 everpresent
 consciousness
 of
 all
 that
 is
 Undoubtedly
 through
 his
 paternal
 heritage
 of
 divine
 attributes
 Jesus
 had
 the
 power
 of
 ascertaining
 for
 Himself
 by
 means
 not
 possessed
 by
 others
 any
 facts
 He
 might
 have
 desired
 to
 know
 nevertheless
 we
 find
 Him
 repeatedly
 asking
 questions
 on
 circumstantial
 detail
 Mark
 
 
 Matt
 
 Luke
 
 and
 this
 He
 did
 even
 after
 His
 resurrection
 Luke

 That
 catechization
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 effective
 means

 mind
 development

 thus
 instructively
 points
 the
 lesson
 as
 illustrated
 by
 our
 Lords
 question
 concerning
 the
 woman
 who
 was
 healed
 of
 her
 issue
 of
 blood
 With
 little
 force
 can
 it
 be
 urged
 that
 it
 would
 have
 been
 inconsistent
 with
 absolute
 truth
 for
 the
 Lord
 to
 profess
 ignorance
 and
 to
 ask
 the
 question
 which
 He
 did
 ask
 if
 all
 the
 while
 He
 perfectly
 knew
 what
 He
 thus
 seemed
 implicitly
 to
 say
 that
 He
 did
 not
 know
 A
 father
 among
 his
 children
 and
 demanding
 Who
 committed
 this
 fault
 himself
 conscious
 even
 while
 he
 asks
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 willing
 to
 bring
 the
 culprit
 to
 a
 full
 confession
 and
 so
 to
 put
 him
 in
 a
 pardonable
 state
 can
 he
 be
 said
 in
 any
 way
 to
 violate
 the
 law
 of
 the
 highest
 truth
 The
 same
 offense
 might
 be
 found
 in
 Elishas
 Whence
 comest
 thou
 Gehazi
 
 Kings
 
 when
 his
 heart
 went
 with
 his
 servant
 all
 the
 way
 that
 he
 had
 gone
 and
 even
 in
 the
 question
 of
 God
 Himself
 to
 Adam
 Where
 art
 thou
 Gen
 
 and
 to
 Cain
 Where
 is
 Abel
 thy
 brother
 Gen
 
 In
 every
 case
 there
 is
 a
 moral
 purpose
 in
 the
 question
 an
 opportunity
 given
 even
 at
 the
 latest
 moment
 for
 making
 good
 at
 least
 a
 part
 of
 the
 error
 by
 its
 unreserved
 confession

 Notes

 the
 Miracles

 Lord

 says
 We
 have
 here
 the
 first
 of
 those
 many
 healings
 of
 the
 blind
 recorded
 Matt
 
 
 
 John
 
 or
 alluded
 to
 Matt
 
 in
 the
 Gospels
 each
 of
 them
 a
 literal
 fulfilment
 of
 that
 prophetic
 word
 of
 Isaiah
 concerning
 the
 days
 of
 Messiah
 Then
 the
 eyes
 of
 the
 blind
 shall
 be
 opened
 
 Frequent
 as
 these
 miracles
 are
 they
 yet
 will
 none
 of
 them
 be
 found
 without
 distinguishing
 features
 of
 their
 own
 That
 they
 should
 be
 so
 numerous
 is
 nothing
 wonderful
 whether
 we
 regard
 the
 fact
 from
 a
 natural
 or
 spiritual
 point
 of
 view
 Regarded
 naturally
 they
 need
 not
 surprize
 us
 if
 we
 keep
 in
 mind
 how
 far
 commoner
 a
 calamity
 is
 blindness
 in
 the
 East
 than
 with
 us
 Regarded
 from
 a
 spiritual
 point
 of
 view
 we
 have
 only
 to
 remember
 how
 commonly
 sin
 is
 contemplated
 in
 Scripture
 as
 a
 moral
 blindness
 Deut
 
 Isa
 
 Job
 
 Zeph
 
 and
 deliverance
 from
 sin
 as
 a
 removal
 of
 this
 blindness
 Isa
 
 
 
 Eph
 
 Matt
 
 and
 we
 shall
 at
 once
 perceive
 how
 fit
 it
 was
 that
 He
 who
 was
 the
 light
 of
 the
 world
 should
 often
 accomplish
 works
 which
 symbolized
 so
 well
 that
 higher
 work
 which
 He
 came
 into
 the
 world
 to
 accomplish
 
 Imputation
 of
 Satanic
 AgencyObserve
 that
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 healing
 the
 dumb
 demoniac
 referred
 to
 in
 the
 text
 Christ
 was
 charged
 with
 being
 in
 league
 with
 the
 devil
 Although
 the
 people
 impressed
 by
 the
 manifestation
 of
 divine
 power
 in
 the
 healing
 exclaimed
 in
 reverence
 It
 was
 never
 so
 seen
 in
 Israel
 the
 Pharisees
 intent
 on
 counteracting
 the
 good
 effect
 of
 the
 Lords
 miraculous
 ministration
 said
 He
 casteth
 out
 devils
 through
 the
 prince
 of
 the
 devils
 Matt

 of
 this
 inconsistent
 and

 charge

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 APOSTOLIC
 MISSION
 AND
 EVENTS
 RELATED
 THERETO
 JESUS
 AGAIN
 IN
 NAZARETH
 It
 will
 be
 remembered
 that
 in
 the
 early
 days
 of
 His
 public
 ministry
 Jesus
 had
 been
 rejected
 by
 the
 people
 of
 Nazareth
 who
 thrust
 Him
 out
 from
 their
 synagog
 and
 tried
 to
 kill
 Him
 It
 appears
 that
 subsequent
 to
 the
 events
 noted
 in
 our
 last
 chapter
 He
 returned
 to
 the
 town
 of
 His
 youth
 and
 again
 raised
 His
 voice
 in
 the
 synagog
 thus
 mercifully
 affording
 the
 people
 another
 opportunity
 to
 learn
 and
 accept
 the
 truth
 The
 Nazarenes
 as
 they
 had
 done
 before
 now
 again
 openly
 expressed
 their
 astonishment
 at
 the
 words
 He
 spoke
 and
 at
 the
 many
 miraculous
 works
 He
 had
 wrought
 nevertheless
 they
 rejected
 Him
 anew
 for
 He
 came
 not
 as
 they
 expected
 the
 Messiah
 to
 come
 and
 they
 refused
 to
 know
 Him
 save
 as
 the
 carpenter
 the
 son
 of
 Mary
 the
 brother
 of
 James
 and
 Joses
 and
 of
 Juda
 and
 Simon
 all
 of
 whom
 were
 common
 folk
 as
 were
 also
 His
 sisters
 And
 they
 were
 offended
 at
 him
 Jesus
 reminded
 them
 of
 the
 proverb
 then
 current
 among
 the
 people
 A
 prophet
 is
 not
 without
 honour
 but
 in
 his
 own
 country
 and
 among
 his
 own
 kin
 and
 in
 his
 own
 house
 Their
 unbelief
 was
 so
 dense
 as
 to
 cause
 Him
 to
 marvel
 and
 because
 of
 their
 lack
 of
 faith
 He
 was
 unable
 to
 accomplish
 any
 great
 work
 except
 to
 heal
 a
 few
 exceptional
 believers
 upon
 whom
 He
 laid
 His
 hands
 Leaving
 Nazareth
 He
 entered
 upon
 His
 third
 tour
 of
 the
 Galilean
 towns
 and
 villages
 preaching
 and
 teaching
 as
 He
 went
 THE
 TWELVE
 CHARGED
 AND
 SENT
 About
 this
 time
 also
 Jesus
 inaugurated
 a
 notable
 expansion
 of
 the
 ministry
 of
 the
 kingdom
 by
 sending
 forth
 the
 Twelve
 on
 assigned
 missions
 Since
 their
 ordination
 the
 apostles
 had
 been
 with
 their
 Lord
 learning
 from
 Him
 by
 public
 discourse
 and
 private
 exposition
 and
 acquiring
 invaluable
 experience
 and
 training
 through
 that
 privileged
 and
 blessed
 companionship
 The
 purpose
 of
 their
 ordination
 was
 specifiedthat
 they
 should
 be
 with
 him
 and
 that
 he
 might
 send
 them
 forth
 to
 preach
 They
 had
 been
 pupils
 under
 the
 Masters
 watchful
 guidance
 for
 many
 months
 and
 now
 they
 were
 called
 to
 enter
 upon
 the
 duties
 of
 their
 calling
 as
 preachers
 of
 the
 gospel
 and
 individual
 witnesses
 of
 the
 Christ
 By
 way
 of
 final
 preparation
 they
 were
 specifically
 and
 solemnly
 charged
 Some
 of
 the
 instructions
 given
 them
 on
 this
 occasion
 had
 particular
 reference
 to
 their
 first
 mission
 from
 which
 they
 would
 in
 due
 time
 return
 and
 report
 other
 directions
 and
 admonitions
 were
 to
 be
 of
 effect
 throughout
 their
 ministry
 even
 after
 the
 Lords
 ascension
 They
 were
 directed
 to
 confine
 their
 ministrations
 for
 the
 time
 being
 to
 the
 lost
 sheep
 of
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 and
 not
 to
 open
 a
 propaganda
 among
 the
 Gentiles
 nor
 even
 in
 Samaritan
 cities
 This
 was
 a
 temporary
 restriction
 imposed
 in
 wisdom
 and
 prudence
 later
 as
 we
 shall
 see
 they
 were
 directed
 to
 preach
 among
 all
 nations
 with
 the
 world
 for
 their
 field
 The
 subject
 of
 their
 discourses
 was
 to
 be
 that
 upon
 which
 they
 had
 heard
 the
 Master
 preachthe
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 at
 hand
 They
 were
 to
 exercize
 the
 authority
 of
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 as
 conferred
 upon
 them
 by
 ordination
 it
 was
 a
 specified
 part
 of
 their
 mission
 to
 heal
 the
 sick
 cleanse
 the
 lepers
 raise
 the
 dead
 cast
 out
 devils
 as
 occasion
 presented
 itself
 and
 they
 were
 commanded
 to
 give
 freely
 even
 as
 they
 had
 freely
 received
 Personal
 comfort
 and
 bodily
 needs
 they
 were
 not
 to
 provide
 for
 the
 people
 were
 to
 be
 proved
 as
 to
 their
 willingness
 to
 receive
 and
 assist
 those
 who
 came
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Lord
 and
 the
 apostles
 themselves
 were
 to
 learn
 to
 rely
 upon
 a
 Provider
 more
 to
 be
 trusted
 than
 man
 therefore
 money
 extra
 clothing
 and
 things
 of
 mere
 convenience
 were
 to
 be
 left
 behind
 In
 the
 several
 towns
 they
 entered
 they
 were
 to
 seek
 entertainment
 and
 leave
 their
 blessing
 upon
 every
 worthy
 family
 into
 which
 they
 were
 received
 If
 they
 found
 themselves
 rejected
 by
 a
 household
 or
 by
 a
 town
 as
 a
 whole
 they
 were
 to
 shake
 the
 dust
 from
 their
 feet
 on
 leaving
 as
 a
 testimony
 against
 the
 people
 and
 it
 was
 decreed
 that
 in
 the
 day
 of
 judgment
 the
 place
 so
 denounced
 would
 fare
 worse
 than
 wicked
 Sodom
 and
 Gomorrha
 upon
 which
 fire
 from
 heaven
 had
 descended
 The
 apostles
 were
 told
 to
 be
 prudent
 to
 give
 no
 needless
 offense
 but
 to
 be
 wise
 as
 serpents
 and
 harmless
 as
 doves
 for
 they
 were
 sent
 forth
 as
 sheep
 into
 the
 midst
 of
 wolves
 They
 were
 not
 to
 recklessly
 entrust
 themselves
 to
 the
 power
 of
 men
 for
 wicked
 men
 would
 persecute
 them
 seek
 to
 arraign
 them
 before
 councils
 and
 courts
 and
 to
 afflict
 them
 in
 the
 synagogs
 Moreover
 they
 might
 expect
 to
 be
 brought
 before
 governors
 and
 kings
 under
 which
 extreme
 conditions
 they
 were
 to
 rely
 upon
 divine
 inspiration
 as
 to
 what
 they
 should
 say
 and
 not
 depend
 upon
 their
 own
 wisdom
 in
 preparation
 and
 premeditation
 For
 said
 the
 Master
 it
 is
 not
 ye
 that
 speak
 but
 the
 Spirit
 of
 your
 Father
 which
 speaketh
 in
 you
 They
 were
 not
 to
 trust
 even
 the
 claims
 of
 kinship
 for
 protection
 for
 families
 would
 be
 divided
 over
 the
 truth
 brother
 against
 brother
 children
 against
 parents
 and
 the
 resulting
 strife
 would
 be
 deadly
 These
 servants
 of
 Christ
 were
 told
 that
 they
 would
 be
 hated
 of
 all
 men
 but
 were
 assured
 that
 their
 sufferings
 were
 to
 be
 for
 His
 names
 sake
 They
 were
 to
 withdraw
 from
 the
 cities
 that
 persecuted
 them
 and
 go
 to
 others
 and
 the
 Lord
 would
 follow
 them
 even
 before
 they
 would
 be
 able
 to
 complete
 the
 circuit
 of
 the
 cities
 of
 Israel
 They
 were
 admonished
 to
 humility
 and
 were
 always
 to
 remember
 that
 they
 were
 servants
 who
 ought
 not
 to
 expect
 to
 escape
 when
 even
 their
 Master
 was
 assailed
 Nevertheless
 they
 were
 to
 be
 fearless
 hesitating
 not
 to
 preach
 the
 gospel
 in
 plainness
 for
 the
 most
 their
 persecutors
 could
 do
 was
 to
 kill
 the
 body
 which
 fate
 was
 as
 nothing
 compared
 to
 that
 of
 suffering
 destruction
 of
 the
 soul
 in
 hell
 Assurance
 of
 the
 Fathers
 watchful
 care
 was
 impressed
 upon
 them
 by
 the
 simple
 reminder
 that
 though
 sparrows
 were
 sold
 two
 for
 a
 farthing
 and
 yet
 not
 a
 sparrow
 could
 be
 sacrificed
 without
 the
 Fathers
 concern
 they
 who
 were
 of
 more
 value
 than
 many
 sparrows
 would
 not
 be
 forgotten
 They
 were
 solemnly
 warned
 that
 whosoever
 would
 freely
 confess
 the
 Christ
 before
 men
 would
 be
 acknowledged
 by
 Him
 in
 the
 Fathers
 presence
 while
 they
 who
 denied
 Him
 before
 men
 would
 be
 denied
 in
 heaven
 And
 again
 they
 were
 told
 that
 the
 gospel
 would
 bring
 strife
 whereby
 households
 would
 be
 disrupted
 for
 the
 doctrine
 the
 Lord
 had
 taught
 would
 be
 as
 a
 sword
 to
 cut
 and
 divide
 The
 duties
 of
 their
 special
 ministry
 were
 to
 supersede
 the
 love
 for
 kindred
 they
 must
 be
 willing
 to
 leave
 father
 mother
 son
 or
 daughter
 whatever
 the
 sacrifice
 for
 said
 Jesus
 He
 that
 taketh
 not
 his
 cross
 and
 followeth
 after
 me
 is
 not
 worthy
 of
 me
 The
 significance
 of
 this
 figure
 must
 have
 been
 solemnly
 impressive
 and
 actually
 terrifying
 for
 the
 cross
 was
 a
 symbol
 of
 ignominy
 extreme
 suffering
 and
 death
 However
 should
 they
 lose
 their
 lives
 for
 His
 sake
 they
 would
 find
 life
 eternal
 while
 he
 who
 was
 not
 willing
 to
 die
 in
 the
 Lords
 service
 should
 lose
 his
 life
 in
 a
 sense
 at
 once
 literal
 and
 awful
 They
 were
 never
 to
 forget
 in
 whose
 name
 they
 were
 sent
 and
 were
 comforted
 with
 the
 assurance
 that
 whoever
 received
 them
 would
 be
 rewarded
 as
 one
 who
 had
 received
 the
 Christ
 and
 His
 Father
 and
 that
 though
 the
 gift
 were
 only
 that
 of
 a
 cup
 of
 cold
 water
 the
 giver
 should
 in
 no
 wise
 lose
 his
 reward
 Thus
 charged
 and
 instructed
 the
 twelve
 special
 witnesses
 of
 the
 Christ
 set
 out
 upon
 their
 mission
 traveling
 in
 pairs
 while
 Jesus
 continued
 His
 personal
 ministry
 THE
 TWELVE
 RETURN
 We
 are
 without
 definite
 information
 as
 to
 the
 duration
 of
 the
 apostles
 first
 mission
 and
 as
 to
 the
 extent
 of
 the
 field
 they
 traversed
 The
 period
 of
 their
 absence
 was
 marked
 by
 many
 important
 developments
 in
 the
 individual
 labors
 of
 Jesus
 It
 is
 probable
 that
 during
 this
 time
 our
 Lord
 visited
 Jerusalem
 on
 the
 occasion
 mentioned
 by
 John
 as
 coincident
 with
 the
 unnamed
 feast
 of
 the
 Jews
 While
 the
 apostles
 were
 absent
 Jesus
 was
 visited
 by
 the
 Baptists
 disciples
 as
 we
 have
 already
 seen
 and
 the
 return
 of
 the
 Twelve
 occurred
 near
 the
 time
 of
 the
 infamous
 execution
 of
 John
 the
 Baptist
 in
 prison
 The
 missionary
 labors
 of
 the
 apostles
 greatly
 augmented
 the
 spread
 of
 the
 new
 doctrine
 of
 the
 kingdom
 and
 the
 name
 and
 works
 of
 Jesus
 were
 proclaimed
 throughout
 the
 land
 The
 people
 of
 Galilee
 were
 at
 that
 time
 in
 a
 state
 of
 discontent
 threatening
 open
 insurrection
 against
 the
 government
 their
 unrest
 had
 been
 aggravated
 by
 the
 murder
 of
 the
 Baptist
 Herod
 Antipas
 who
 had
 given
 the
 fatal
 order
 trembled
 in
 his
 palace
 He
 heard
 with
 fear
 due
 to
 inward
 conviction
 of
 guilt
 of
 the
 marvelous
 works
 wrought
 by
 Jesus
 and
 in
 terror
 averred
 that
 Christ
 could
 be
 none
 other
 than
 John
 Baptist
 returned
 from
 the
 tomb
 His
 fawning
 courtiers
 essayed
 to
 allay
 his
 fears
 by
 saying
 that
 Jesus
 was
 Elijah
 or
 some
 other
 of
 the
 prophets
 whose
 advent
 had
 been
 predicted
 but
 the
 consciencestricken
 Herod
 said
 It
 is
 John
 whom
 I
 beheaded
 he
 is
 risen
 from
 the
 dead
 Herod
 desired
 to
 see
 Jesus
 perhaps
 through
 the
 fascination
 of
 fear
 or
 with
 the
 faint
 hope
 that
 sight
 of
 the
 renowned
 Prophet
 of
 Nazareth
 might
 dispel
 his
 superstitious
 dread
 that
 the
 murdered
 John
 had
 returned
 to
 life
 Upon
 the
 completion
 of
 their
 missionary
 tour
 the
 apostles
 rejoined
 the
 Master
 and
 reported
 to
 Him
 both
 what
 they
 had
 taught
 and
 what
 they
 had
 done
 by
 way
 of
 authoritative
 ministration
 They
 had
 preached
 the
 gospel
 of
 repentance
 in
 all
 the
 cities
 towns
 and
 villages
 to
 which
 they
 had
 gone
 they
 had
 anointed
 with
 oil
 many
 afflicted
 ones
 and
 the
 power
 of
 their
 priesthood
 had
 been
 attested
 by
 consequent
 healings
 even
 unclean
 spirits
 and
 devils
 had
 been
 subject
 unto
 them
 They
 found
 Jesus
 attended
 by
 great
 multitudes
 and
 they
 had
 little
 opportunity
 of
 private
 conference
 with
 Him
 for
 there
 were
 many
 coming
 and
 going
 and
 they
 had
 no
 leisure
 so
 much
 as
 to
 eat
 The
 apostles
 must
 have
 heard
 in
 gladness
 the
 Lords
 invitation
 Come
 ye
 yourselves
 apart
 into
 a
 desert
 place
 and
 rest
 awhile
 In
 quest
 of
 seclusion
 Jesus
 and
 the
 Twelve
 withdrew
 from
 the
 throng
 and
 privately
 entered
 a
 boat
 in
 which
 they
 crossed
 to
 a
 rural
 spot
 adjacent
 to
 the
 city
 of
 Bethsaida
 Their
 departure
 had
 not
 been
 unobserved
 however
 and
 eager
 crowds
 hastened
 along
 the
 shore
 and
 partly
 around
 the
 northerly
 end
 of
 the
 lake
 to
 join
 the
 party
 at
 the
 landing
 place
 From
 Johns
 account
 we
 are
 led
 to
 infer
 that
 before
 the
 arrival
 of
 great
 numbers
 Jesus
 and
 His
 companions
 had
 ascended
 the
 hillside
 near
 the
 shore
 where
 for
 a
 short
 time
 they
 had
 rested
 As
 the
 multitude
 gathered
 on
 the
 lower
 slopes
 our
 Lord
 looked
 upon
 them
 as
 upon
 sheep
 without
 a
 shepherd
 and
 yielding
 to
 their
 desire
 and
 to
 His
 own
 emotions
 of
 divine
 pity
 He
 taught
 them
 many
 things
 healed
 their
 afflicted
 ones
 and
 comforted
 their
 hearts
 with
 compassionate
 tenderness
 FIVE
 THOUSAND
 FED
 IN
 THE
 DESERT
 So
 intent
 were
 the
 people
 on
 hearing
 the
 Lords
 words
 and
 so
 concerned
 in
 the
 miraculous
 relief
 resulting
 from
 His
 healing
 ministrations
 that
 they
 remained
 in
 the
 wilderness
 oblivious
 to
 the
 passing
 of
 the
 hours
 until
 the
 evening
 approached
 It
 was
 the
 springtime
 near
 the
 recurrence
 of
 the
 annual
 Passover
 festival
 the
 season
 of
 grass
 and
 flowers
 Jesus
 realizing
 that
 the
 people
 were
 hungry
 asked
 Philip
 one
 of
 the
 Twelve
 Whence
 shall
 we
 buy
 bread
 that
 these
 may
 eat
 The
 purpose
 of
 the
 question
 was
 to
 test
 the
 apostles
 faith
 for
 the
 Lord
 had
 already
 determined
 as
 to
 what
 was
 to
 be
 done
 Philips
 reply
 showed
 surprize
 at
 the
 question
 and
 conveyed
 his
 thought
 that
 the
 suggested
 undertaking
 was
 impossible
 Two
 hundred
 pennyworth
 of
 bread
 is
 not
 sufficient
 for
 them
 that
 every
 one
 of
 them
 may
 take
 a
 little
 said
 he
 Andrew
 added
 that
 there
 was
 a
 lad
 present
 who
 had
 five
 barley
 loaves
 and
 two
 small
 fishes
 But
 said
 he
 what
 are
 they
 among
 so
 many
 Such
 is
 Johns
 account
 the
 other
 writers
 state
 that
 the
 apostles
 reminded
 Jesus
 of
 the
 lateness
 of
 the
 hour
 and
 urged
 that
 He
 send
 the
 people
 away
 to
 seek
 for
 themselves
 food
 and
 lodging
 in
 the
 nearest
 towns
 It
 appears
 most
 probable
 that
 the
 conversation
 between
 Jesus
 and
 Philip
 occurred
 earlier
 in
 the
 afternoon
 and
 that
 as
 the
 hours
 sped
 the
 Twelve
 became
 concerned
 and
 advized
 that
 the
 multitude
 be
 dismissed
 The
 Masters
 reply
 to
 the
 apostles
 was
 They
 need
 not
 depart
 give
 ye
 them
 to
 eat
 In
 amazed
 wonder
 they
 replied
 We
 have
 here
 but
 five
 loaves
 and
 two
 fishes
 and
 Andrews
 despairing
 comment
 is
 implied
 againWhat
 are
 they
 among
 so
 many
 Jesus
 gave
 command
 and
 the
 people
 seated
 themselves
 on
 the
 grass
 in
 orderly
 array
 they
 were
 grouped
 in
 fifties
 and
 hundreds
 and
 it
 was
 found
 that
 the
 multitude
 numbered
 about
 five
 thousand
 men
 beside
 women
 and
 children
 Taking
 the
 loaves
 and
 the
 fishes
 Jesus
 looked
 toward
 heaven
 and
 pronounced
 a
 blessing
 upon
 the
 food
 then
 dividing
 the
 provisions
 He
 gave
 to
 the
 apostles
 severally
 and
 they
 in
 turn
 distributed
 to
 the
 multitude
 The
 substance
 of
 both
 fish
 and
 bread
 increased
 under
 the
 Masters
 touch
 and
 the
 multitude
 feasted
 there
 in
 the
 desert
 until
 all
 were
 satisfied
 To
 the
 disciples
 Jesus
 said
 Gather
 up
 the
 fragments
 that
 remain
 that
 nothing
 be
 lost
 and
 twelve
 baskets
 were
 filled
 with
 the
 surplus
 As
 to
 the
 miracle
 itself
 human
 knowledge
 is
 powerless
 to
 explain
 Though
 wrought
 on
 so
 great
 a
 scale
 it
 is
 no
 more
 nor
 less
 inexplicable
 than
 any
 other
 of
 the
 Lords
 miraculous
 works
 It
 was
 a
 manifestation
 of
 creative
 power
 by
 which
 material
 elements
 were
 organized
 and
 compounded
 to
 serve
 a
 present
 and
 pressing
 need
 The
 broken
 but
 unused
 portion
 exceeded
 in
 bulk
 and
 weight
 the
 whole
 of
 the
 original
 little
 store
 Our
 Lords
 direction
 to
 gather
 up
 the
 fragments
 was
 an
 impressive
 objectlesson
 against
 waste
 and
 it
 may
 have
 been
 to
 afford
 such
 lesson
 that
 an
 excess
 was
 supplied
 The
 fare
 was
 simple
 yet
 nourishing
 wholesome
 and
 satisfying
 Barley
 bread
 and
 fish
 constituted
 the
 usual
 food
 of
 the
 poorer
 classes
 of
 the
 region
 The
 conversion
 of
 water
 into
 wine
 at
 Cana
 was
 a
 qualitative
 transmutation
 the
 feeding
 of
 the
 multitude
 involved
 a
 quantitative
 increase
 who
 can
 say
 that
 one
 or
 which
 of
 these
 miracles
 of
 provision
 was
 the
 more
 wonderful
 The
 multitude
 now
 fed
 and
 filled
 gave
 some
 consideration
 to
 the
 miracle
 In
 Jesus
 by
 whom
 so
 great
 a
 work
 had
 been
 wrought
 they
 recognized
 One
 having
 superhuman
 powers
 This
 is
 of
 a
 truth
 the
 prophet
 that
 should
 come
 into
 the
 world
 said
 theythe
 Prophet
 whose
 coming
 had
 been
 foretold
 by
 Moses
 and
 who
 should
 be
 like
 unto
 himself
 Even
 as
 Israel
 had
 been
 miraculously
 fed
 during
 the
 time
 of
 Moses
 so
 now
 was
 bread
 provided
 in
 the
 desert
 by
 this
 new
 Prophet
 In
 their
 enthusiasm
 the
 people
 proposed
 to
 proclaim
 Him
 king
 and
 forcibly
 compel
 Him
 to
 become
 their
 leader
 Such
 was
 their
 gross
 conception
 of
 Messianic
 supremacy
 Jesus
 directed
 His
 disciples
 to
 depart
 by
 boat
 while
 He
 remained
 to
 dismiss
 the
 now
 excited
 multitude
 The
 disciples
 hesitated
 to
 leave
 their
 Master
 but
 He
 constrained
 them
 and
 they
 obeyed
 His
 insistence
 that
 the
 Twelve
 depart
 from
 both
 Himself
 and
 the
 multitude
 may
 have
 been
 due
 to
 a
 desire
 to
 protect
 the
 chosen
 disciples
 against
 possible
 infection
 by
 the
 materialistic
 and
 unrighteous
 designs
 of
 the
 throng
 to
 make
 Him
 king
 By
 means
 that
 are
 not
 detailed
 He
 caused
 the
 people
 to
 disperse
 and
 as
 night
 came
 on
 He
 found
 that
 for
 which
 He
 had
 come
 in
 quest
 solitude
 and
 quiet
 Ascending
 the
 hill
 He
 chose
 a
 secluded
 place
 and
 there
 remained
 in
 prayer
 during
 the
 greater
 part
 of
 the
 night
 IT
 IS
 I
 BE
 NOT
 AFRAID
 The
 return
 by
 boat
 proved
 to
 be
 a
 memorable
 journey
 for
 the
 disciples
 They
 encountered
 a
 boisterous
 headwind
 which
 of
 course
 rendered
 impossible
 the
 use
 of
 sails
 and
 though
 they
 toiled
 heavily
 at
 the
 oars
 the
 vessel
 became
 practically
 unmanageable
 and
 wallowed
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 sea
 Though
 they
 had
 labored
 through
 the
 night
 they
 had
 progressed
 less
 than
 four
 miles
 on
 their
 course
 to
 turn
 and
 run
 before
 the
 wind
 would
 have
 been
 to
 invite
 disastrous
 wreck
 their
 sole
 hope
 lay
 in
 their
 holding
 the
 vessel
 to
 the
 wind
 by
 sheer
 power
 of
 muscle
 Jesus
 in
 His
 place
 of
 solitary
 retirement
 was
 aware
 of
 their
 sad
 plight
 and
 along
 in
 the
 fourth
 watch
 that
 is
 between
 three
 and
 six
 oclock
 in
 the
 morning
 He
 came
 to
 their
 assistance
 walking
 upon
 the
 stormtossed
 water
 as
 though
 treading
 solid
 ground
 When
 the
 voyagers
 caught
 sight
 of
 Him
 as
 He
 approached
 the
 ship
 in
 the
 faint
 light
 of
 the
 nearspent
 night
 they
 were
 overcome
 by
 superstitious
 fears
 and
 cried
 out
 in
 terror
 thinking
 that
 they
 saw
 a
 ghostly
 apparition
 But
 straightway
 Jesus
 spake
 unto
 them
 saying
 Be
 of
 good
 cheer
 it
 is
 I
 be
 not
 afraid
 Relieved
 by
 these
 assuring
 words
 Peter
 impetuous
 and
 impulsive
 as
 usual
 cried
 out
 Lord
 if
 it
 be
 thou
 bid
 me
 come
 unto
 thee
 on
 the
 water
 Jesus
 assenting
 Peter
 descended
 from
 the
 ship
 and
 walked
 toward
 his
 Master
 but
 as
 the
 wind
 smote
 him
 and
 the
 waves
 rose
 about
 him
 his
 confidence
 wavered
 and
 he
 began
 to
 sink
 Strong
 swimmer
 though
 he
 was
 he
 gave
 way
 to
 fright
 and
 cried
 Lord
 save
 me
 Jesus
 caught
 him
 by
 the
 hand
 saying
 O
 thou
 of
 little
 faith
 wherefore
 didst
 thou
 doubt
 From
 Peters
 remarkable
 experience
 we
 learn
 that
 the
 power
 by
 which
 Christ
 was
 able
 to
 walk
 the
 waves
 could
 be
 made
 operative
 in
 others
 provided
 only
 their
 faith
 was
 enduring
 It
 was
 on
 Peters
 own
 request
 that
 he
 was
 permitted
 to
 attempt
 the
 feat
 Had
 Jesus
 forbidden
 him
 the
 mans
 faith
 might
 have
 suffered
 a
 check
 his
 attempt
 though
 attended
 by
 partial
 failure
 was
 a
 demonstration
 of
 the
 efficacy
 of
 faith
 in
 the
 Lord
 such
 as
 no
 verbal
 teaching
 could
 ever
 have
 conveyed
 Jesus
 and
 Peter
 entered
 the
 vessel
 immediately
 the
 wind
 ceased
 and
 the
 boat
 soon
 reached
 the
 shore
 The
 amazement
 of
 the
 apostles
 at
 this
 latest
 manifestation
 of
 the
 Lords
 control
 over
 the
 forces
 of
 nature
 would
 have
 been
 more
 akin
 to
 worship
 and
 less
 like
 terrified
 consternation
 had
 they
 remembered
 the
 earlier
 wonders
 they
 had
 witnessed
 but
 they
 had
 forgotten
 even
 the
 miracle
 of
 the
 loaves
 and
 their
 hearts
 had
 hardened
 Marveling
 at
 the
 power
 of
 One
 to
 whom
 the
 windlashed
 sea
 was
 a
 sustaining
 floor
 the
 apostles
 bowed
 before
 the
 Lord
 in
 reverent
 worship
 saying
 Of
 a
 truth
 thou
 art
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 Aside
 from
 the
 marvelous
 circumstances
 of
 its
 literal
 occurrence
 the
 miracle
 is
 rich
 in
 symbolism
 and
 suggestion
 By
 what
 law
 or
 principle
 the
 effect
 of
 gravitation
 was
 superseded
 so
 that
 a
 human
 body
 could
 be
 supported
 upon
 the
 watery
 surface
 man
 is
 unable
 to
 affirm
 The
 phenomenon
 is
 a
 concrete
 demonstration
 of
 the
 great
 truth
 that
 faith
 is
 a
 principle
 of
 power
 whereby
 natural
 forces
 may
 be
 conditioned
 and
 controlled
 Into
 every
 adult
 human
 life
 come
 experiences
 like
 unto
 the
 battling
 of
 the
 stormtossed
 voyagers
 with
 contrary
 winds
 and
 threatening
 seas
 ofttimes
 the
 night
 of
 struggle
 and
 danger
 is
 far
 advanced
 before
 succor
 appears
 and
 then
 too
 frequently
 the
 saving
 aid
 is
 mistaken
 for
 a
 greater
 terror
 As
 came
 unto
 Peter
 and
 his
 terrified
 companions
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 turbulent
 waters
 so
 comes
 to
 all
 who
 toil
 in
 faith
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 DelivererIt
 is
 I
 be
 not
 afraid
 IN
 THE
 LAND
 OF
 GENNESARET
 The
 night
 voyage
 in
 the
 course
 of
 which
 Jesus
 had
 reached
 the
 boat
 with
 its
 frightened
 occupants
 while
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 sea
 ended
 at
 some
 point
 within
 the
 district
 known
 as
 the
 land
 of
 Gennesaret
 which
 as
 generally
 believed
 embraced
 the
 rich
 and
 fertile
 region
 in
 the
 vicinity
 of
 Tiberias
 and
 Magdala
 Of
 the
 natural
 beauties
 for
 which
 the
 region
 was
 famed
 much
 has
 been
 written
 Word
 of
 our
 Lords
 presence
 there
 spread
 rapidly
 and
 from
 all
 that
 country
 round
 about
 the
 people
 flocked
 to
 Him
 bringing
 their
 afflicted
 to
 receive
 of
 His
 beneficence
 by
 word
 or
 touch
 In
 the
 towns
 through
 which
 He
 walked
 the
 sick
 were
 laid
 in
 the
 streets
 that
 the
 blessing
 of
 His
 passing
 might
 fall
 upon
 them
 and
 many
 besought
 him
 that
 they
 might
 touch
 if
 it
 were
 but
 the
 border
 of
 his
 garment
 and
 as
 many
 as
 touched
 him
 were
 made
 whole
 Bounteously
 did
 He
 impart
 of
 His
 healing
 virtue
 to
 all
 who
 came
 asking
 with
 faith
 and
 confidence
 Thus
 accompanied
 by
 the
 Twelve
 He
 wended
 His
 way
 northward
 to
 Capernaum
 making
 the
 pathway
 bright
 by
 the
 plentitude
 of
 His
 mercies
 IN
 SEARCH
 OF
 LOAVES
 AND
 FISHES
 The
 multitude
 who
 on
 the
 yesterday
 had
 partaken
 of
 His
 bounty
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 the
 lake
 and
 who
 dispersed
 for
 the
 night
 after
 their
 ineffectual
 attempt
 to
 force
 upon
 Him
 the
 dignity
 of
 earthly
 kingship
 were
 greatly
 surprized
 in
 the
 morning
 to
 discover
 that
 He
 had
 departed
 They
 had
 seen
 the
 disciples
 leave
 in
 the
 only
 boat
 there
 present
 while
 Jesus
 had
 remained
 on
 shore
 and
 they
 knew
 that
 the
 night
 tempest
 had
 precluded
 the
 possibility
 of
 other
 boats
 reaching
 the
 place
 Nevertheless
 their
 morning
 search
 for
 Him
 was
 futile
 and
 they
 concluded
 that
 He
 must
 have
 returned
 by
 land
 round
 the
 end
 of
 the
 lake
 As
 the
 day
 advanced
 some
 boats
 were
 sighted
 bound
 for
 the
 western
 coast
 these
 they
 hailed
 and
 securing
 passage
 crossed
 to
 Capernaum
 Their
 difficulty
 in
 locating
 Jesus
 was
 at
 an
 end
 for
 His
 presence
 was
 known
 throughout
 the
 town
 Coming
 to
 Him
 probably
 as
 He
 sat
 in
 the
 synagog
 for
 on
 this
 day
 He
 taught
 there
 some
 of
 the
 most
 intrusive
 of
 the
 crowd
 asked
 brusquely
 and
 almost
 rudely
 Rabbi
 when
 camest
 thou
 hither
 To
 this
 impertinent
 inquiry
 Jesus
 deigned
 no
 direct
 reply
 in
 the
 miracle
 of
 the
 preceding
 night
 the
 people
 had
 no
 part
 and
 no
 account
 of
 our
 Lords
 movements
 was
 given
 them
 In
 tone
 of
 impressive
 rebuke
 Jesus
 said
 unto
 them
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Ye
 seek
 me
 not
 because
 ye
 saw
 the
 miracles
 but
 because
 ye
 did
 eat
 of
 the
 loaves
 and
 were
 filled
 Their
 concern
 was
 for
 the
 bread
 and
 fishes
 One
 who
 could
 supply
 them
 with
 victuals
 as
 He
 had
 done
 must
 not
 be
 lost
 sight
 of
 The
 Masters
 rebuke
 was
 followed
 by
 admonition
 and
 instruction
 Labour
 not
 for
 the
 meat
 which
 perisheth
 but
 for
 that
 meat
 which
 endureth
 unto
 everlasting
 life
 which
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 shall
 give
 unto
 you
 for
 him
 hath
 God
 the
 Father
 sealed
 This
 contrast
 between
 material
 and
 spiritual
 food
 they
 could
 not
 entirely
 fail
 to
 understand
 and
 some
 of
 them
 asked
 what
 they
 should
 do
 to
 serve
 God
 as
 Jesus
 required
 The
 answer
 was
 This
 is
 the
 work
 of
 God
 that
 ye
 believe
 on
 him
 whom
 he
 hath
 sent
 That
 Jesus
 was
 referring
 to
 Himself
 none
 could
 doubt
 and
 straightway
 they
 demanded
 of
 Him
 further
 evidence
 of
 His
 divine
 commission
 they
 would
 see
 greater
 signs
 The
 miracle
 of
 the
 loaves
 and
 fishes
 was
 nearly
 a
 day
 old
 and
 its
 impressiveness
 as
 evidence
 of
 Messianic
 attributes
 was
 waning
 Moses
 had
 fed
 their
 fathers
 with
 manna
 in
 the
 desert
 they
 said
 and
 plainly
 they
 regarded
 a
 continued
 daily
 supply
 as
 a
 greater
 gift
 than
 a
 single
 meal
 of
 bread
 and
 fish
 however
 much
 the
 latter
 may
 have
 been
 appreciated
 in
 the
 exigency
 of
 hunger
 Moreover
 the
 manna
 was
 heavenly
 food
 whereas
 the
 bread
 He
 had
 given
 them
 was
 of
 earth
 and
 only
 common
 barley
 bread
 at
 that
 He
 must
 show
 them
 greater
 signs
 and
 give
 them
 richer
 provender
 before
 they
 would
 accept
 Him
 as
 the
 One
 whom
 they
 at
 first
 had
 taken
 Him
 to
 be
 and
 whom
 He
 now
 declared
 Himself
 to
 be
 CHRIST
 THE
 BREAD
 OF
 LIFE
 Then
 Jesus
 said
 unto
 them
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Moses
 gave
 you
 not
 that
 bread
 from
 heaven
 but
 my
 Father
 giveth
 you
 the
 true
 bread
 from
 heaven
 For
 the
 bread
 of
 God
 is
 he
 which
 cometh
 down
 from
 heaven
 and
 giveth
 life
 unto
 the
 world
 They
 were
 mistaken
 in
 assuming
 that
 Moses
 had
 given
 them
 manna
 and
 after
 all
 the
 manna
 had
 been
 but
 ordinary
 food
 in
 that
 those
 who
 ate
 of
 it
 hungered
 again
 but
 now
 the
 Father
 offered
 them
 bread
 from
 heaven
 such
 as
 would
 insure
 them
 life
 As
 the
 Samaritan
 woman
 at
 the
 well
 on
 hearing
 the
 Lord
 speak
 of
 water
 that
 would
 satisfy
 once
 for
 all
 had
 begged
 impulsively
 and
 with
 thought
 only
 of
 physical
 convenience
 Sir
 give
 me
 this
 water
 that
 I
 thirst
 not
 neither
 come
 hither
 to
 draw
 so
 these
 people
 eager
 to
 secure
 so
 satisfying
 a
 food
 as
 that
 of
 which
 Jesus
 spake
 implored
 Lord
 evermore
 give
 us
 this
 bread
 Perhaps
 this
 request
 was
 not
 wholly
 gross
 there
 may
 have
 been
 in
 the
 hearts
 of
 some
 of
 them
 at
 least
 a
 genuine
 desire
 for
 spiritual
 nourishment
 Jesus
 met
 their
 appeal
 with
 an
 explanation
 I
 am
 the
 bread
 of
 life
 he
 that
 cometh
 to
 me
 shall
 never
 hunger
 and
 he
 that
 believeth
 on
 me
 shall
 never
 thirst
 He
 reminded
 them
 that
 though
 they
 had
 seen
 Him
 they
 believed
 not
 His
 words
 and
 assured
 them
 that
 those
 who
 really
 accepted
 Him
 would
 do
 as
 the
 Father
 directed
 Then
 without
 metaphor
 or
 symbolism
 He
 affirmed
 I
 came
 down
 from
 heaven
 not
 to
 do
 mine
 own
 will
 but
 the
 will
 of
 him
 that
 sent
 me
 And
 the
 Fathers
 will
 was
 that
 all
 who
 would
 accept
 the
 Son
 should
 have
 everlasting
 life
 There
 were
 present
 in
 the
 synagog
 some
 of
 the
 rulersPharisees
 scribes
 rabbisand
 these
 designated
 collectively
 as
 the
 Jews
 criticized
 Jesus
 and
 murmured
 against
 Him
 because
 He
 had
 said
 I
 am
 the
 bread
 which
 came
 down
 from
 heaven
 They
 averred
 that
 He
 could
 do
 nothing
 more
 than
 any
 man
 could
 do
 He
 was
 known
 to
 them
 as
 the
 son
 of
 Joseph
 and
 as
 far
 as
 they
 knew
 was
 of
 ordinary
 earthly
 parentage
 and
 yet
 He
 had
 the
 temerity
 to
 declare
 that
 He
 had
 come
 down
 from
 heaven
 Chiefly
 to
 this
 class
 rather
 than
 to
 the
 promiscuous
 crowd
 who
 had
 hastened
 after
 Him
 Jesus
 appears
 to
 have
 addressed
 the
 remainder
 of
 His
 discourse
 He
 advized
 them
 to
 cease
 their
 murmurings
 for
 it
 was
 a
 certainty
 that
 they
 could
 not
 apprehend
 His
 meaning
 and
 therefore
 would
 not
 believe
 Him
 unless
 they
 had
 been
 taught
 of
 God
 as
 the
 prophets
 had
 written
 and
 none
 could
 come
 to
 Him
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 accepting
 His
 saving
 gospel
 unless
 the
 Father
 drew
 them
 to
 the
 Son
 and
 none
 save
 those
 who
 were
 receptive
 willing
 and
 prepared
 could
 be
 so
 drawn
 Yet
 belief
 in
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 is
 an
 indispensable
 condition
 to
 salvation
 as
 Jesus
 indicated
 in
 His
 affirmation
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 he
 that
 believeth
 on
 me
 hath
 everlasting
 life
 Then
 reverting
 to
 the
 symbolism
 of
 the
 bread
 He
 reiterated
 I
 am
 the
 bread
 of
 life
 In
 further
 elucidation
 He
 explained
 that
 while
 their
 fathers
 did
 truly
 eat
 manna
 in
 the
 wilderness
 yet
 they
 were
 dead
 whereas
 the
 bread
 of
 life
 of
 which
 He
 spake
 would
 insure
 eternal
 life
 unto
 all
 who
 partook
 thereof
 That
 bread
 He
 averred
 was
 His
 flesh
 Against
 this
 solemn
 avowal
 the
 Jews
 complained
 anew
 and
 disputed
 among
 themselves
 some
 asking
 derisively
 How
 can
 this
 man
 give
 us
 his
 flesh
 to
 eat
 Emphasizing
 the
 doctrine
 Jesus
 continued
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Except
 ye
 eat
 the
 flesh
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 and
 drink
 his
 blood
 ye
 have
 no
 life
 in
 you
 Whoso
 eateth
 my
 flesh
 and
 drinketh
 my
 blood
 hath
 eternal
 life
 and
 I
 will
 raise
 him
 up
 at
 the
 last
 day
 For
 my
 flesh
 is
 meat
 indeed
 and
 my
 blood
 is
 drink
 indeed
 He
 that
 eateth
 my
 flesh
 and
 drinketh
 my
 blood
 dwelleth
 in
 me
 and
 I
 in
 him
 As
 the
 living
 Father
 hath
 sent
 me
 and
 I
 live
 by
 the
 Father
 so
 he
 that
 eateth
 me
 even
 he
 shall
 live
 by
 me
 This
 is
 that
 bread
 which
 came
 down
 from
 heaven
 not
 as
 your
 fathers
 did
 eat
 manna
 and
 are
 dead
 he
 that
 eateth
 of
 this
 bread
 shall
 live
 forever
 There
 was
 little
 excuse
 for
 the
 Jews
 pretending
 to
 understand
 that
 our
 Lord
 meant
 an
 actual
 eating
 and
 drinking
 of
 His
 material
 flesh
 and
 blood
 The
 utterances
 to
 which
 they
 objected
 were
 far
 more
 readily
 understood
 by
 them
 than
 they
 are
 by
 us
 on
 first
 reading
 for
 the
 representation
 of
 the
 law
 and
 of
 truth
 in
 general
 as
 bread
 and
 the
 acceptance
 thereof
 as
 a
 process
 of
 eating
 and
 drinking
 were
 figures
 in
 everyday
 use
 by
 the
 rabbis
 of
 that
 time
 Their
 failure
 to
 comprehend
 the
 symbolism
 of
 Christs
 doctrine
 was
 an
 act
 of
 will
 not
 the
 natural
 consequence
 of
 innocent
 ignorance
 To
 eat
 the
 flesh
 and
 drink
 the
 blood
 of
 Christ
 was
 and
 is
 to
 believe
 in
 and
 accept
 Him
 as
 the
 literal
 Son
 of
 God
 and
 Savior
 of
 the
 world
 and
 to
 obey
 His
 commandments
 By
 these
 means
 only
 may
 the
 Spirit
 of
 God
 become
 an
 abiding
 part
 of
 mans
 individual
 being
 even
 as
 the
 substance
 of
 the
 food
 he
 eats
 is
 assimilated
 with
 the
 tissues
 of
 his
 body
 It
 is
 not
 sufficing
 to
 accept
 the
 precepts
 of
 Christ
 as
 we
 may
 adopt
 the
 doctrines
 of
 scientists
 philosophers
 and
 savants
 however
 great
 the
 wisdom
 of
 these
 sages
 may
 be
 for
 such
 acceptance
 is
 by
 mental
 assent
 or
 deliberate
 exercize
 of
 will
 and
 has
 relation
 to
 the
 doctrine
 only
 as
 independent
 of
 the
 author
 The
 teachings
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 endure
 because
 of
 their
 intrinsic
 worth
 and
 many
 men
 respect
 His
 aphorisms
 proverbs
 parables
 and
 His
 profoundly
 philosophical
 precepts
 who
 yet
 reject
 Him
 as
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 in
 the
 flesh
 the
 GodMan
 in
 whom
 were
 united
 the
 attributes
 of
 Deity
 with
 those
 of
 humanity
 the
 chosen
 and
 foreordained
 Redeemer
 of
 mankind
 through
 whom
 alone
 may
 salvation
 be
 attained
 But
 the
 figure
 used
 by
 Jesusthat
 of
 eating
 His
 flesh
 and
 drinking
 His
 blood
 as
 typical
 of
 unqualified
 and
 absolute
 acceptance
 of
 Himself
 as
 the
 Savior
 of
 men
 is
 of
 superlative
 import
 for
 thereby
 are
 affirmed
 the
 divinity
 of
 His
 Person
 and
 the
 fact
 of
 His
 preexistent
 and
 eternal
 Godship
 The
 sacrament
 of
 the
 Lords
 supper
 established
 by
 the
 Savior
 on
 the
 night
 of
 His
 betrayal
 perpetuates
 the
 symbolism
 of
 eating
 His
 flesh
 and
 drinking
 His
 blood
 by
 the
 partaking
 of
 bread
 and
 wine
 in
 remembrance
 of
 Him
 Acceptance
 of
 Jesus
 as
 the
 Christ
 implies
 obedience
 to
 the
 laws
 and
 ordinances
 of
 His
 gospel
 for
 to
 profess
 the
 One
 and
 refuse
 the
 other
 is
 but
 to
 convict
 ourselves
 of
 inconsistency
 insincerity
 and
 hypocrisy
 A
 CRUCIAL
 TESTMANY
 TURN
 AWAY
 The
 truth
 respecting
 Himself
 as
 taught
 by
 the
 Lord
 in
 this
 His
 last
 discourse
 in
 the
 synagog
 at
 Capernaum
 proved
 to
 be
 a
 test
 of
 faith
 through
 which
 many
 fell
 away
 Not
 alone
 critical
 Jews
 of
 the
 official
 class
 whose
 hostility
 was
 openly
 avowed
 but
 those
 who
 had
 professed
 some
 measure
 of
 belief
 in
 Him
 were
 affected
 Many
 therefore
 of
 his
 disciples
 when
 they
 had
 heard
 this
 said
 This
 is
 an
 hard
 saying
 who
 can
 hear
 it
 Jesus
 cognizant
 of
 their
 disaffection
 asked
 Doth
 this
 offend
 you
 and
 added
 What
 and
 if
 ye
 shall
 see
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 ascend
 up
 where
 he
 was
 before
 His
 ascension
 which
 was
 to
 follow
 His
 death
 and
 resurrection
 is
 here
 definitely
 implied
 The
 spiritual
 significance
 of
 His
 teachings
 was
 put
 beyond
 question
 by
 the
 explanation
 that
 only
 through
 the
 Spirit
 could
 they
 comprehend
 Therefore
 He
 added
 said
 I
 unto
 you
 that
 no
 man
 can
 come
 unto
 me
 except
 it
 were
 given
 unto
 him
 of
 my
 Father
 Many
 deserted
 Him
 and
 from
 that
 time
 sought
 Him
 no
 more
 The
 occasion
 was
 crucial
 the
 effect
 was
 that
 of
 sifting
 and
 separation
 The
 portentous
 prediction
 of
 the
 Baptistprophet
 had
 entered
 upon
 the
 stage
 of
 fulfilment
 One
 mightier
 than
 I
 cometh
 
 Whose
 fan
 is
 in
 his
 hand
 and
 he
 will
 thoroughly
 purge
 his
 floor
 and
 gather
 his
 wheat
 into
 the
 garner
 but
 he
 will
 burn
 up
 the
 chaff
 with
 unquenchable
 fire
 The
 fan
 was
 in
 operation
 and
 much
 chaff
 was
 blown
 aside
 It
 appears
 that
 even
 the
 Twelve
 were
 unable
 to
 comprehend
 the
 deeper
 meaning
 of
 these
 latest
 teachings
 they
 were
 puzzled
 though
 none
 actually
 deserted
 Nevertheless
 the
 state
 of
 mind
 of
 some
 was
 such
 as
 to
 evoke
 from
 Jesus
 the
 question
 Will
 ye
 also
 go
 away
 Peter
 speaking
 for
 himself
 and
 his
 brethren
 answered
 with
 pathos
 and
 conviction
 Lord
 to
 whom
 shall
 we
 go
 thou
 hast
 the
 words
 of
 eternal
 life
 The
 spirit
 of
 the
 Holy
 Apostleship
 was
 manifest
 in
 this
 confession
 Though
 they
 were
 unable
 to
 comprehend
 in
 fulness
 the
 doctrine
 they
 knew
 Jesus
 to
 be
 the
 Christ
 and
 were
 faithful
 to
 Him
 while
 others
 turned
 away
 into
 the
 dark
 depths
 of
 apostasy
 While
 Peter
 spoke
 for
 the
 apostolic
 body
 as
 a
 whole
 there
 was
 among
 them
 one
 who
 silently
 revolted
 the
 treacherous
 Iscariot
 who
 was
 in
 worse
 plight
 than
 an
 openly
 avowed
 apostate
 was
 there
 The
 Lord
 knew
 this
 mans
 heart
 and
 said
 Have
 not
 I
 chosen
 you
 twelve
 and
 one
 of
 you
 is
 a
 devil
 The
 historian
 adds
 He
 spake
 of
 Judas
 Iscariot
 the
 son
 of
 Simon
 for
 he
 it
 was
 that
 should
 betray
 him
 being
 one
 of
 the
 twelve
 NOTES
 TO
 CHAPTER
 
 
 Jesus
 at
 NazarethAs
 no
 one
 of
 the
 Gospelwriters
 records
 two
 occasions
 of
 our
 Lords
 ministry
 in
 Nazareth
 and
 as
 the
 separate
 accounts
 appearing
 in
 the
 synoptic
 Gospels
 closely
 resemble
 one
 another
 in
 a
 few
 particulars
 some
 commentators
 hold
 that
 our
 Lord
 preached
 to
 His
 townsmen
 in
 Nazareth
 and
 was
 rejected
 by
 them
 but
 once
 Lukes
 account
 
 refers
 to
 an
 occasion
 immediately
 following
 the
 first
 return
 of
 Jesus
 to
 Galilee
 after
 His
 baptism
 and
 temptations
 and
 directly
 preceding
 the
 preliminary
 call
 of
 the
 fishermendisciples
 who
 afterward
 were
 numbered
 among
 the
 apostles
 Matthew
 
 and
 Mark
 
 chronicle
 a
 visit
 of
 Jesus
 to
 Nazareth
 later
 than
 the
 occasion
 of
 the
 first
 teaching
 in
 parables
 and
 the
 events
 immediately
 following
 the
 same
 We
 have
 good
 reason
 for
 accepting
 Lukes
 record
 as
 that
 of
 an
 early
 incident
 and
 the
 accounts
 given
 by
 Matthew
 and
 Mark
 as
 those
 of
 a
 later
 visit
 
 GentilesIn
 a
 general
 way
 the
 Jews
 designated
 all
 other
 peoples
 as
 Gentiles
 though
 the
 same
 Hebrew
 word
 is
 rendered
 in
 the
 Old
 Testament
 variously
 as
 Gentiles
 Gen
 
 Judg
 
 
 
 Isa
 
 etc
 nations
 Gen
 
 
 
 
 
 
 etc
 and
 heathen
 Neh
 
 Psa
 
 
 etc
 the
 essential
 element
 of
 designation
 being
 that
 of
 foreigners
 In
 Smiths
 Dict
 of
 the
 Bible
 we
 read
 It
 the
 name
 Gentiles
 acquired
 an
 ethnographic
 and
 also
 an
 invidious
 meaning
 as
 other
 nations
 were
 idolatrous
 rude
 hostile
 etc
 yet
 the
 Jews
 were
 able
 to
 use
 it
 in
 a
 purely
 technical
 geographical
 sense
 when
 it
 was
 usually
 translated
 nations
 Dr
 Edward
 E
 Nourse
 writing
 for
 the
 Standard
 Bible
 Dictionary
 says
 In
 New
 Testament
 times
 the
 Jew
 divided
 mankind
 into
 three
 classes
 
 Jews
 
 Greeks
 Hellenes
 made
 to
 include
 Romans
 thus
 meaning
 the
 civilized
 peoples
 of
 the
 Roman
 Empire
 often
 rendered
 Gentiles
 in
 Authorized
 Version
 and
 
 barbarians
 the
 uncivilized
 Acts
 
 Rom
 
 
 Cor
 
 The
 injunction
 laid
 by
 Jesus
 upon
 the
 TwelveGo
 not
 into
 the
 way
 of
 the
 Gentileswas
 to
 restrain
 them
 for
 the
 time
 being
 from
 attempting
 to
 make
 converts
 among
 the
 Romans
 and
 Greeks
 and
 to
 confine
 their
 ministry
 to
 the
 people
 of
 Israel
 
 Shaking
 the
 Dust
 from
 the
 FeetTo
 ceremonially
 shake
 the
 dust
 from
 ones
 feet
 as
 a
 testimony
 against
 another
 was
 understood
 by
 the
 Jews
 to
 symbolize
 a
 cessation
 of
 fellowship
 and
 a
 renunciation
 of
 all
 responsibility
 for
 consequences
 that
 might
 follow
 It
 became
 an
 ordinance
 of
 accusation
 and
 testimony
 by
 the
 Lords
 instructions
 to
 His
 apostles
 as
 cited
 in
 the
 text
 In
 the
 current
 dispensation
 the
 Lord
 has
 similarly
 directed
 His
 authorized
 servants
 to
 so
 testify
 against
 those
 who
 wilfully
 and
 maliciously
 oppose
 the
 truth
 when
 authoritatively
 presented
 see
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 
 
 
 
 The
 responsibility
 of
 testifying
 before
 the
 Lord
 by
 this
 accusing
 symbol
 is
 so
 great
 that
 the
 means
 may
 be
 employed
 only
 under
 unusual
 and
 extreme
 conditions
 as
 the
 Spirit
 of
 the
 Lord
 may
 direct
 
 The
 Two
 BethsaidasIt
 is
 held
 by
 many
 Bible
 students
 that
 Bethsaida
 in
 the
 desert
 region
 adjoining
 which
 Jesus
 and
 the
 Twelve
 sought
 rest
 and
 seclusion
 was
 the
 town
 of
 that
 name
 in
 Perea
 on
 the
 eastern
 side
 of
 the
 Jordan
 and
 known
 more
 specifically
 as
 Bethsaida
 Julias
 to
 distinguish
 it
 from
 Bethsaida
 in
 Galilee
 which
 latter
 was
 close
 to
 Capernaum
 The
 Perean
 village
 of
 Bethsaida
 had
 been
 enlarged
 and
 raised
 to
 the
 rank
 of
 a
 town
 by
 the
 tetrarch
 Philip
 and
 by
 him
 had
 been
 named
 Julias
 in
 honor
 of
 Julia
 daughter
 of
 the
 reigning
 emperor
 The
 Gospel
 narratives
 of
 the
 voyage
 by
 which
 Jesus
 and
 His
 companions
 reached
 the
 place
 and
 of
 the
 return
 therefrom
 are
 conformable
 to
 the
 assumption
 that
 Bethsaida
 Julias
 in
 Perea
 and
 not
 Bethsaida
 in
 Galilee
 was
 the
 town
 to
 which
 the
 desert
 place
 referred
 to
 was
 an
 outlying
 district
 
 The
 Earlier
 and
 the
 Later
 EveningMatthew
 specifies
 two
 evenings
 of
 the
 day
 on
 which
 the
 five
 thousand
 were
 fed
 thus
 when
 it
 was
 evening
 the
 disciples
 asked
 Jesus
 to
 send
 away
 the
 multitude
 and
 later
 after
 the
 miraculous
 feeding
 and
 after
 the
 disciples
 had
 left
 by
 boat
 and
 after
 the
 crowds
 had
 departed
 when
 the
 evening
 was
 come
 Jesus
 was
 alone
 on
 the
 mountain
 Matt
 
 
 compare
 Mark
 
 
 Trench

 the
 Miracles

 St
 Matthew
 and
 St
 Mark

 had
 already
 commenced
 before
 the
 preparations
 for
 the
 feeding

 the
 multitude

 begun

 the
 other
 now
 when
 the
 disciples
 had
 entered
 into
 the
 ship
 and
 set
 forth
 on
 their
 voyage

 And
 this
 was
 an
 ordinary
 way
 of
 speaking
 among
 the
 Jews
 the
 first
 evening
 being
 very
 much
 our
 afternoon
 
 the
 second
 evening
 being
 the
 twilight
 or
 from
 six
 oclock
 to
 twilight

 is
 a
 natural
 division
 between
 the
 late
 afternoon
 when
 the
 sun
 is
 low
 and
 the
 evening
 when
 his
 light
 has
 not
 wholly
 disappeared
 the
 two
 evenings
 into
 which
 the
 natural
 evening
 would
 be
 cut
 by
 the
 commencement
 of
 the
 civil
 day
 if
 it
 began
 at
 sunset
 
 Watches
 of
 the
 NightDuring
 the
 greater
 part
 of
 Old
 Testament
 time
 the
 people
 of
 Israel
 divided
 the
 night
 into
 three
 watches
 each
 of
 four
 hours
 such
 a
 period
 being
 that
 of
 individual
 sentinel
 duty
 Before
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 Christian
 era
 however
 the
 Jews
 had
 adopted
 the
 Roman
 order
 of
 four
 nightwatches
 each
 lasting
 three
 hours
 These
 were
 designated
 numerically
 eg
 the
 fourth
 watch
 mentioned
 in
 the
 text
 see
 Matt
 
 or
 as
 even
 midnight
 cockcrowing
 and
 morning
 see
 Mark
 
 The
 fourth
 watch
 was
 the
 last
 of
 the
 threehour
 periods
 between
 sunset
 and
 sunrise
 or
 between
 
 pm
 and
 
 am
 and
 therefore
 extended
 from
 
 to
 
 oclock
 in
 the
 morning
 
 The
 Hem
 of
 the
 GarmentThe
 faith
 of
 those
 who
 believed
 that
 if
 they
 could
 but
 touch
 the
 border
 of
 the
 Lords
 garment
 they
 would
 be
 healed
 is
 in
 line
 with
 that
 of
 the
 woman
 who
 was
 healed
 of
 her
 longstanding
 malady
 by
 so
 touching
 His
 robe
 see
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 
 Luke
 
 The
 Jews
 regarded
 the
 border
 or
 hem
 of
 their
 outer
 robes
 as
 of
 particular
 importance
 because
 of
 the
 requirement
 made
 of
 Israel
 in
 earlier
 days
 Numb
 
 
 that
 the
 border
 be
 fringed
 and
 supplied
 with
 a
 band
 of
 blue
 as
 a
 reminder
 to
 them
 of
 their
 obligations
 as
 the
 covenant
 people
 The
 desire
 to
 touch
 the
 hem
 of
 Christs
 robe
 may
 have
 been
 associated
 with
 this
 thought
 of
 sanctity
 attaching
 to
 the
 hem
 or
 border
 
 Traditions
 Concerning
 MannaThe
 supplying
 of
 manna
 to
 the
 Israelites
 incident
 to
 the
 exodus
 and
 the
 long
 travel
 in
 the
 wilderness
 was
 rightly
 regarded
 as
 a
 work
 of
 surpassing
 wonder
 Exo
 
 Numb
 
 Deut
 
 
 Josh
 
 Psa
 
 
 Many
 traditions
 some
 of
 them
 perniciously
 erroneous
 gathered
 about
 the
 incident
 and
 were
 transmitted
 with
 invented
 additions
 from
 generation
 to
 generation
 In
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 the
 rabbinical
 teaching
 was
 that
 the
 manna
 on
 which
 the
 fathers
 had
 fed
 was
 literally
 the
 food
 of
 the
 angels
 sent
 down
 from
 heaven
 and
 that
 it
 was
 of
 diverse
 taste
 and
 flavor
 to
 suit
 all
 ages
 conditions
 or
 desires
 to
 one
 it
 tasted
 like
 honey
 to
 another
 as
 bread
 etc
 but
 in
 all
 Gentile
 mouths
 it
 was
 bitter
 Moreover
 it
 was
 said
 that
 the
 Messiah
 would
 give
 an
 unfailing
 supply
 of
 manna
 to
 Israel
 when
 He
 came
 amongst
 them
 These
 erroneous
 conceptions
 in
 part
 explain
 the
 demand
 of
 those
 who
 had
 been
 fed
 on
 barley
 loaves
 and
 fishes
 for
 a
 sign
 that
 would
 surpass
 the
 giving
 of
 manna
 in
 the
 olden
 days
 as
 evidence
 of
 the
 Messiahship
 of
 Jesus
 
 Faith
 a
 Gift
 of
 GodThough
 within
 the
 reach
 of
 all
 who
 diligently
 strive
 to
 gain
 it
 faith
 is
 nevertheless
 a
 divine
 gift
 and
 can
 be
 obtained
 only
 from
 God

 who

 by
 their
 sincerity
 that
 they
 are
 worthy
 of
 it
 and
 who
 give
 promise
 of
 abiding
 by
 its
 dictates
 Although
 faith
 is
 called
 the
 first
 principle
 of
 the
 Gospel
 of
 Christ
 though
 it
 be
 in
 fact
 the
 foundation
 of
 all
 religion
 yet
 even
 faith
 is
 preceded
 by
 sincerity
 of
 disposition
 and
 humility
 of
 soul

 God
 may
 make
 an
 impression

 Spiritual
 Symbolism
 of
 EatingThe
 idea
 of
 eating
 as
 a
 metaphor
 for
 receiving
 spiritual
 benefit
 was
 familiar
 to
 Christs
 hearers
 and
 was
 as
 readily
 understood
 as
 our
 expressionsdevouring
 a
 book
 or
 drinking
 in
 instruction
 In
 Isaiah
 
 the
 words
 the
 whole
 stay
 of
 bread
 were
 explained
 by
 the
 rabbis
 as
 referring
 to
 their
 own
 teaching
 and
 they
 laid
 it
 down
 as
 a
 rule
 that
 wherever
 in
 Ecclesiastes
 allusion
 was
 made
 to
 food
 or
 drink
 it
 meant
 study
 of
 the
 law
 and
 the
 practise
 of
 good
 works
 It
 was
 a
 saying
 among
 themIn
 the
 time
 of
 the
 Messiah
 the
 Israelites
 will
 be
 fed
 by
 Him
 Nothing
 was
 more
 common
 in
 the
 schools
 and
 synagogs
 than
 the
 phrases
 of
 eating
 and
 drinking
 in
 a
 metaphorical
 sense
 Messiah
 is
 not
 likely
 to
 come
 to
 Israel
 said
 Hillel
 for
 they
 have
 already
 eaten
 Himthat
 is
 greedily
 received
 His
 wordsin
 the
 days
 of
 Hezekiah
 A
 current
 conventionalism
 in
 the
 synagogs
 was
 that
 the
 just
 would
 eat
 the
 Shekinah
 It
 was
 peculiar
 to
 the
 Jews
 to
 be
 taught
 in
 such
 metaphorical
 language
 Their
 rabbis
 never
 spoke
 in
 plain
 words
 and
 it
 is
 expressly
 said
 that
 Jesus
 submitted
 to
 the
 popular
 taste
 for
 without
 a
 parable
 spake
 he
 not
 unto
 them

 The
 Crucial
 Nature
 of
 the
 DiscourseCommenting
 on
 the
 effect
 of
 our
 Lords
 discourse
 John
 
 Edersheim
 vol
 ii
 p
 
 says
 Here
 then
 we
 are
 at
 the
 parting
 of
 the
 two
 ways
 and
 just
 because
 it
 was
 the
 hour
 of
 decision
 did
 Christ
 so
 clearly
 set
 forth
 the
 highest
 truths
 concerning
 Himself
 in
 opposition
 to
 the
 views
 which
 the
 multitude
 entertained
 about
 the
 Messiah
 The
 result
 was
 yet
 another
 and
 a
 sorer
 defection
 Upon
 this
 many
 of
 His
 disciples
 went
 back
 and
 walked
 no
 more
 with
 Him
 Nay
 the
 searching
 trial
 reached
 even
 unto
 the
 hearts
 of
 the
 Twelve
 Would
 they
 also
 go
 away
 It
 was
 an
 anticipation
 of
 Gethsemaneits
 first
 experience
 But
 one
 thing
 kept
 them
 true
 It
 was
 the
 experience
 of
 the
 past
 This
 was
 the
 basis
 of
 their
 present
 faith
 and
 allegiance
 They
 could
 not
 go
 back
 to
 their
 old
 past
 they
 must
 cleave
 to
 Him
 So
 Peter
 spake
 it
 in
 name
 of
 them
 all
 Lord
 to
 whom
 shall
 we
 go
 Words
 of
 eternal
 life
 hast
 thou
 Nay
 and
 more
 than
 this
 as
 the
 result
 of
 what
 they
 had
 learned
 And
 we
 have
 believed
 and
 know
 that
 thou
 art
 the
 Holy
 One
 of
 God
 It
 is
 thus
 also
 that
 many
 of
 us
 whose
 thoughts
 may
 have
 been
 sorely
 tossed
 and
 whose
 foundations
 terribly
 assailed
 may
 have
 found
 our
 first
 restingplace
 in
 the
 assured
 unassailable
 spiritual
 experience
 of
 the
 past
 Whither
 can
 we
 go
 for
 words
 of
 eternal
 life
 if
 not
 to
 Christ
 If
 He
 fails
 us
 then
 all
 hope
 of
 the
 eternal
 is
 gone
 But
 He
 has
 the
 words
 of
 eternal
 lifeand
 we
 believed
 when
 they
 first
 came
 to
 us
 nay
 we
 know
 that
 He
 is
 the
 Holy
 One
 of
 God
 And
 this
 conveys
 all
 that
 faith
 needs
 for
 further
 learning
 The
 rest
 will
 He
 show
 when
 He
 is
 transfigured
 in
 our
 sight
 But
 of
 these
 Twelve
 Christ
 knew
 one
 to
 be
 a
 devillike
 that
 angel
 fallen
 from
 highest
 height
 to
 lowest
 depth
 The
 apostasy
 of
 Judas
 had
 already
 commenced
 in
 his
 heart
 And
 the
 greater
 the
 popular
 expectancy
 and
 disappointment
 had
 been
 the
 greater
 the
 reaction
 and
 the
 enmity
 that
 followed
 The
 hour
 of
 decision
 was
 past
 and
 the
 hand
 on
 the
 dial
 pointed
 to
 the
 hour
 of
 His
 death

 CHAPTER
 
 A
 PERIOD
 OF
 DARKENING
 OPPOSITION
 Our
 Lords
 last
 recorded
 discourse
 in
 the
 synagog
 at
 Capernaum
 which
 followed
 close
 upon
 the
 miracle
 of
 feeding
 the
 five
 thousand
 and
 that
 of
 walking
 upon
 the
 water
 marked
 the
 beginning
 of
 another
 epoch
 in
 the
 development
 of
 His
 lifes
 work
 It
 was
 the
 season
 of
 an
 approaching
 Passover
 festival
 and
 at
 the
 next
 succeeding
 Passover
 one
 year
 later
 as
 shall
 be
 shown
 Jesus
 would
 be
 betrayed
 to
 His
 death
 At
 the
 time
 of
 which
 we
 now
 speak
 therefore
 He
 was
 entering
 upon
 the
 last
 year
 of
 His
 ministry
 in
 the
 flesh
 But
 the
 significance
 of
 the
 event
 is
 other
 and
 greater
 than
 that
 of
 a
 chronological
 datumplane
 The
 circumstance
 marked
 the
 first
 stage
 of
 a
 turn
 in
 the
 tide
 of
 popular
 regard
 toward
 Jesus
 which
 theretofore
 had
 been
 increasing
 and
 which
 now
 began
 to
 ebb
 True
 He
 had
 been
 repeatedly
 criticized
 and
 openly
 assailed
 by
 complaining
 Jews
 on
 many
 earlier
 occasions
 but
 these
 crafty
 and
 even
 venomous
 critics
 were
 mostly
 of
 the
 ruling
 classes
 the
 common
 people
 had
 heard
 Him
 gladly
 and
 indeed
 many
 of
 them
 continued
 so
 to
 do
 nevertheless
 His
 popularity
 in
 Galilee
 at
 least
 had
 begun
 to
 wane
 The
 last
 year
 of
 His
 earthly
 ministration
 was
 inaugurated
 by
 a
 sifting
 of
 the
 people
 who
 professed
 to
 believe
 His
 word
 and
 this
 process
 of
 test
 trial
 and
 separation
 was
 to
 continue
 to
 the
 end
 We
 are
 without
 information
 as
 to
 Jesus
 having
 attended
 this
 Passover
 feast
 and
 it
 is
 reasonable
 to
 infer
 that
 in
 view
 of
 the
 increasing
 hostility
 on
 the
 part
 of
 the
 rulers
 He
 refrained
 from
 going
 to
 Jerusalem
 on
 the
 occasion
 Conjecture
 as
 to
 whether
 any
 of
 the
 Twelve
 went
 up
 to
 the
 festival
 is
 profitless
 we
 are
 not
 told
 Certain
 it
 is
 that
 immediately
 after
 this
 time
 the
 detectives
 and
 spies
 who
 had
 been
 sent
 from
 Jerusalem
 into
 Galilee
 to
 watch
 Jesus
 became
 more
 active
 than
 ever
 in
 their
 critical
 espionage
 They
 dogged
 His
 footsteps
 noted
 every
 act
 and
 every
 instance
 of
 omission
 of
 traditional
 or
 customary
 observance
 and
 were
 constantly
 on
 the
 alert
 to
 make
 Him
 out
 an
 offender
 CEREMONIAL
 WASHINGS
 AND
 MANY
 SUCH
 LIKE
 THINGS
 Shortly
 after
 the
 Passover
 to
 which
 allusion
 has
 been
 made
 and
 probably
 in
 accordance
 with
 a
 plan
 decided
 upon
 by
 the
 Jewish
 rulers
 Jesus
 was
 visited
 by
 a
 delegation
 of
 Pharisees
 and
 scribes
 who
 had
 come
 from
 Jerusalem
 and
 who
 made
 protest
 against
 the
 disregard
 of
 traditional
 requirements
 by
 His
 followers
 It
 appears
 that
 the
 disciples
 and
 almost
 certainly
 the
 Master
 Himself
 had
 so
 far
 transgressed
 the
 tradition
 of
 the
 elders
 as
 to
 omit
 the
 ceremonial
 washing
 of
 hands
 before
 eating
 the
 Pharisaic
 critics
 found
 fault
 and
 came
 demanding
 explanation
 and
 justification
 if
 such
 were
 possible
 Mark
 tells
 us
 that
 the
 disciples
 were
 charged
 with
 having
 eaten
 with
 defiled
 or
 as
 the
 marginal
 reading
 gives
 it
 with
 common
 hands
 and
 he
 interpolates
 the
 following
 concise
 and
 lucid
 note
 concerning
 the
 custom
 which
 the
 disciples
 were
 said
 to
 have
 ignored
 For
 the
 Pharisees
 and
 all
 the
 Jews
 except
 they
 wash
 their
 hands
 oft
 eat
 not
 holding
 the
 tradition
 of
 the
 elders
 And
 when
 they
 come
 from
 the
 market
 except
 they
 wash
 they
 eat
 not
 And
 many
 other
 things
 there
 be
 which
 they
 have
 received
 to
 hold
 as
 the
 washing
 of
 cups
 and
 pots
 brasen
 vessels
 and
 of
 tables
 It
 should
 be
 borne
 in
 mind
 that
 the
 offense
 charged
 against
 the
 disciples
 was
 that
 of
 ceremonial
 uncleanness
 not
 physical
 uncleanliness
 or
 disregard
 of
 sanitary
 propriety
 they
 were
 said
 to
 have
 eaten
 with
 common
 or
 defiled
 hands
 not
 specifically
 with
 dirty
 fingers
 In
 all
 the
 externals
 of
 their
 manmade
 religionism
 the
 Jews
 were
 insistent
 on
 scrupulous
 exactitude
 every
 possibility
 of
 ceremonial
 defilement
 was
 to
 be
 carefully
 guarded
 against
 and
 the
 effects
 thereof
 had
 to
 be
 counteracted
 by
 prescribed
 washings
 To
 the
 question
 Why
 do
 thy
 disciples
 transgress
 the
 tradition
 of
 the
 elders
 for
 they
 wash
 not
 their
 hands
 when
 they
 eat
 bread
 Jesus
 gave
 no
 direct
 reply
 but
 asked
 as
 a
 rejoinder
 Why
 do
 ye
 also
 transgress
 the
 commandment
 of
 God
 by
 your
 tradition
 To
 the
 Pharisaic
 mind
 this
 must
 have
 been
 a
 very
 sharp
 rebuke
 for
 rabbinism
 held
 that
 rigorous
 compliance
 with
 the
 traditions
 of
 the
 elders
 was
 more
 important
 than
 observance
 of
 the
 law
 itself
 and
 Jesus
 in
 His
 counter
 question
 put
 their
 cherished
 traditions
 as
 in
 direct
 conflict
 with
 the
 commandment
 of
 God
 Adding
 to
 their
 discomfiture
 He
 cited
 the
 prophecy
 of
 Isaiah
 and
 applied
 to
 them
 whom
 He
 designated
 hypocrites
 the
 prophets
 words
 Well
 hath
 Esaias
 prophesied
 of
 you
 hypocrites
 as
 it
 is
 written
 This
 people
 honoureth
 me
 with
 their
 lips
 but
 their
 heart
 is
 far
 from
 me
 Howbeit
 in
 vain
 do
 they
 worship
 me
 teaching
 for
 doctrines
 the
 commandments
 of
 men
 With
 deserved
 severity
 Jesus
 carried
 the
 lesson
 home
 to
 their
 consciences
 declaring
 that
 they
 had
 laid
 aside
 the
 commandments
 of
 God
 in
 order
 that
 they
 might
 follow
 the
 traditions
 of
 men
 This
 accusing
 affirmation
 was
 followed
 by
 the
 citing
 of
 an
 undeniable
 instance
 Moses
 had
 voiced
 the
 direct
 commandment
 of
 God
 in
 saying
 Honour
 thy
 father
 and
 thy
 mother
 and
 had
 proclaimed
 the
 ordained
 penalty
 in
 extreme
 cases
 of
 unfilial
 conduct
 thus
 Whoso
 curseth
 father
 or
 mother
 let
 him
 die
 but
 this
 law
 though
 given
 of
 God
 direct
 to
 Israel
 had
 been
 so
 completely
 superseded
 that
 any
 ungrateful
 and
 wicked
 son
 could
 find
 ready
 means
 which
 their
 traditions
 had
 made
 lawful
 of
 escaping
 all
 filial
 obligations
 even
 though
 his
 parents
 were
 destitute
 If
 a
 needy
 father
 or
 mother
 craved
 help
 of
 a
 son
 he
 had
 but
 to
 sayWhat
 you
 ask
 of
 me
 is
 Corbanor
 in
 other
 words
 an
 intended
 gift
 to
 God
 and
 he
 was
 held
 to
 be
 legally
 exempt
 from
 all
 requirements
 to
 contribute
 of
 that
 substance
 to
 the
 support
 of
 his
 parents
 Other
 obligations
 could
 be
 similarly
 evaded
 To
 declare
 that
 any
 article
 of
 property
 real
 or
 personal
 or
 any
 part
 or
 proportion
 of
 ones
 possessions
 was
 corban
 was
 generally
 understood
 as
 an
 averment
 that
 the
 property
 so
 characterized
 was
 dedicated
 to
 the
 temple
 or
 at
 least
 was
 intended
 to
 be
 devoted
 to
 ecclesiastical
 purposes
 and
 would
 eventually
 be
 turned
 over
 to
 the
 officials
 though
 the
 donor
 might
 continue
 to
 hold
 possession
 during
 a
 specified
 period
 extending
 even
 to
 the
 end
 of
 his
 life
 Property
 was
 often
 declared
 to
 be
 corban
 for
 other
 purposes
 than
 dedication
 to
 ecclesiastical
 use
 The
 result
 of
 such
 established
 though
 utterly
 unlawful
 and
 pernicious
 traditions
 was
 as
 Jesus
 emphatically
 stated
 to
 the
 Pharisees
 and
 scribes
 to
 make
 the
 word
 of
 God
 of
 none
 effect
 and
 He
 added
 Many
 such
 like
 things
 do
 ye
 Turning
 from
 His
 titled
 visitors
 He
 called
 the
 people
 together
 and
 proclaimed
 unto
 them
 the
 truth
 as
 follows
 Hearken
 unto
 me
 every
 one
 of
 you
 and
 understand
 There
 is
 nothing
 from
 without
 a
 man
 that
 entering
 into
 him
 can
 defile
 him
 but
 the
 things
 which
 come
 out
 of
 him
 those
 are
 they
 that
 defile
 the
 man
 If
 any
 man
 have
 ears
 to
 hear
 let
 him
 hear
 This
 was
 directly
 in
 conflict
 with
 rabbinical
 precept
 and
 practise
 the
 Pharisees
 were
 offended
 for
 they
 had
 said
 that
 to
 eat
 with
 hands
 that
 had
 not
 been
 ritualistically
 cleansed
 was
 to
 defile
 the
 food
 touched
 and
 in
 turn
 to
 become
 yet
 more
 defiled
 from
 the
 food
 thus
 rendered
 unclean
 The
 apostles
 were
 not
 sure
 that
 they
 understood
 the
 Masters
 lesson
 though
 couched
 in
 plain
 nonfigurative
 language
 it
 was
 to
 some
 of
 them
 very
 like
 a
 parable
 and
 Peter
 asked
 an
 exposition
 The
 Lord
 explained
 that
 the
 food
 one
 eats
 is
 but
 temporarily
 part
 of
 his
 body
 having
 served
 its
 purpose
 of
 nourishing
 the
 tissues
 and
 supplying
 energy
 to
 the
 organism
 it
 is
 eliminated
 therefore
 the
 food
 that
 enters
 the
 body
 through
 the
 mouth
 is
 of
 small
 and
 transient
 importance
 compared
 with
 the
 utterances
 that
 issue
 from
 the
 mouth
 for
 these
 if
 evil
 are
 truly
 defiling
 As
 Jesus
 set
 forth
 Those
 things
 which
 proceed
 out
 of
 the
 mouth
 come
 forth
 from
 the
 heart
 and
 they
 defile
 the
 man
 For
 out
 of
 the
 heart
 proceed
 evil
 thoughts
 murders
 adulteries
 fornications
 thefts
 false
 witness
 blasphemies
 these
 are
 the
 things
 which
 defile
 a
 man
 but
 to
 eat
 with
 unwashen
 hands
 defileth
 not
 a
 man
 Some
 of
 the
 disciples
 asked
 Jesus
 whether
 He
 knew
 that
 the
 Pharisees
 had
 taken
 offense
 at
 His
 saying
 His
 answer
 was
 a
 further
 denunciation
 of
 Pharisaism
 Every
 plant
 which
 my
 heavenly
 Father
 hath
 not
 planted
 shall
 be
 rooted
 up
 Let
 them
 alone
 they
 be
 blind
 leaders
 of
 the
 blind
 And
 if
 the
 blind
 lead
 the
 blind
 both
 shall
 fall
 into
 the
 ditch
 There
 could
 be
 no
 compromize
 between
 His
 doctrine
 of
 the
 kingdom
 and
 the
 corrupt
 Judaism
 of
 the
 time
 The
 rulers
 were
 plotting
 against
 His
 life
 if
 their
 emissaries
 chose
 to
 take
 offense
 at
 His
 words
 let
 them
 be
 offended
 and
 stand
 the
 consequences
 but
 blessed
 would
 they
 be
 if
 they
 were
 not
 offended
 because
 of
 Him
 He
 had
 no
 conciliatory
 measures
 to
 offer
 those
 whose
 inability
 to
 understand
 His
 meaning
 was
 the
 result
 of
 wilful
 obstinacy
 or
 darkness
 of
 mind
 produced
 by
 persistence
 in
 sin
 WITHIN
 THE
 BORDERS
 OF
 TYRE
 AND
 SIDON
 Unable
 to
 find
 in
 Galilee
 rest
 seclusion
 or
 adequate
 opportunity
 of
 instructing
 the
 Twelve
 as
 He
 desired
 to
 do
 Jesus
 departed
 with
 them
 northward
 and
 journeyed
 into
 the
 coasts
 or
 borders
 of
 Phenicia
 a
 district
 commonly
 known
 by
 the
 names
 of
 its
 prominent
 cities
 Tyre
 and
 Sidon
 In
 one
 of
 the
 little
 towns
 near
 the
 border
 the
 party
 took
 lodgings
 but
 the
 attempt
 to
 secure
 privacy
 was
 futile
 for
 the
 Masters
 presence
 could
 not
 be
 hid
 His
 fame
 had
 preceded
 Him
 beyond
 the
 boundaries
 of
 the
 land
 of
 Israel
 On
 earlier
 occasions
 people
 from
 the
 region
 of
 Tyre
 and
 Sidon
 had
 been
 among
 His
 listeners
 and
 some
 of
 them
 had
 been
 blessed
 by
 His
 healing
 mercies
 A
 woman
 hearing
 of
 His
 presence
 within
 her
 own
 land
 came
 asking
 a
 boon
 Mark
 tells
 us
 she
 was
 a
 Greek
 or
 more
 literally
 a
 Gentile
 who
 spoke
 Greek
 and
 by
 nationality
 a
 SyroPhenician
 Matthew
 says
 she
 was
 a
 woman
 of
 Canaan
 these
 statements
 are
 in
 harmony
 since
 the
 Phenicians
 were
 of
 Canaanite
 descent
 The
 Gospelhistorians
 make
 clear
 the
 fact
 that
 this
 woman
 was
 of
 pagan
 or
 heathen
 birth
 and
 we
 know
 that
 among
 the
 peoples
 so
 classed
 the
 Canaanites
 were
 held
 in
 particular
 disrepute
 by
 the
 Jews
 The
 woman
 cried
 aloud
 to
 Jesus
 saying
 Have
 mercy
 on
 me
 O
 Lord
 thou
 son
 of
 David
 my
 daughter
 is
 grievously
 vexed
 with
 a
 devil
 Her
 words
 expressed
 at
 once
 faith
 in
 the
 Lords
 power
 and
 a
 fulness
 of
 motherlove
 for
 she
 implored
 as
 though
 she
 were
 the
 afflicted
 sufferer
 The
 fact
 that
 she
 addressed
 Jesus
 as
 Son
 of
 David
 demonstrates
 her
 belief
 that
 He
 was
 the
 Messiah
 of
 Israel
 At
 first
 Jesus
 refrained
 from
 answering
 her
 Undeterred
 she
 pleaded
 the
 more
 until
 the
 disciples
 besought
 the
 Lord
 saying
 Send
 her
 away
 for
 she
 crieth
 after
 us
 Their
 intervention
 was
 probably
 an
 intercession
 in
 her
 behalf
 she
 could
 be
 quieted
 by
 the
 granting
 of
 her
 request
 as
 it
 was
 she
 was
 making
 an
 undesirable
 scene
 probably
 on
 the
 street
 and
 the
 Twelve
 knew
 well
 that
 their
 Master
 sought
 quietude
 To
 them
 Jesus
 said
 I
 am
 not
 sent
 but
 unto
 the
 lost
 sheep
 of
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 and
 the
 remark
 must
 have
 reminded
 them
 of
 the
 restriction
 under
 which
 they
 had
 been
 sent
 out
 The
 woman
 with
 importunate
 desire
 came
 near
 possibly
 entering
 the
 house
 she
 fell
 at
 the
 Lords
 feet
 and
 worshiped
 Him
 pleading
 pitifully
 Lord
 help
 me
 To
 her
 Jesus
 said
 It
 is
 not
 meet
 to
 take
 the
 childrens
 bread
 and
 to
 cast
 it
 to
 dogs
 The
 words
 harsh
 as
 they
 may
 sound
 to
 us
 were
 understood
 by
 her
 in
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 Lords
 intent
 The
 original
 term
 here
 translated
 dogs
 connoted
 as
 the
 narrative
 shows
 not
 the
 vagrant
 and
 despized
 curs
 elsewhere
 spoken
 of
 in
 the
 Bible
 as
 typical
 of
 a
 degraded
 state
 or
 of
 positive
 badness
 but
 literally
 the
 little
 dogs
 or
 domestic
 pets
 such
 as
 were
 allowed
 in
 the
 house
 and
 under
 the
 table
 Certainly
 the
 woman
 took
 no
 offense
 at
 the
 comparison
 and
 found
 therein
 no
 objectionable
 epithet
 Instantly
 she
 adopted
 the
 analogy
 and
 applied
 it
 in
 combined
 argument
 and
 supplication
 Truth
 Lord
 yet
 the
 dogs
 eat
 of
 the
 crumbs
 which
 fall
 from
 their
 masters
 table
 or
 in
 the
 words
 of
 Marks
 version
 Yes
 Lord
 yet
 the
 dogs
 under
 the
 table
 eat
 of
 the
 childrens
 crumbs
 Her
 prayer
 was
 immediately
 granted
 for
 Jesus
 said
 unto
 her
 O
 woman
 great
 is
 thy
 faith
 be
 it
 unto
 thee
 even
 as
 thou
 wilt
 And
 her
 daughter
 was
 made
 whole
 from
 that
 very
 hour
 Mark
 emphasizes
 the
 special
 recognition
 of
 her
 final
 plea
 and
 adds
 And
 when
 she
 was
 come
 to
 her
 house
 she
 found
 the
 devil
 gone
 out
 and
 her
 daughter
 laid
 upon
 the
 bed
 The
 womans
 commendable
 persistency
 was
 based
 on
 the
 faith
 that
 overcomes
 apparent
 obstacles
 and
 endures
 even
 under
 discouragement
 Her
 case
 reminds
 one
 of
 the
 lesson
 taught
 by
 the
 Lord
 on
 another
 occasion
 through
 the
 story
 of
 the
 importunate
 widow
 Many
 have
 queried
 as
 to
 why
 Jesus
 delayed
 the
 blessing
 We
 may
 not
 be
 able
 to
 fathom
 His
 purposes
 but
 we
 see
 that
 by
 the
 course
 He
 adopted
 the
 womans
 faith
 was
 demonstrated
 and
 the
 disciples
 were
 instructed
 Jesus
 impressed
 upon
 her
 that
 she
 was
 not
 of
 the
 chosen
 people
 to
 whom
 He
 had
 been
 sent
 but
 His
 words
 prefigured
 the
 giving
 of
 the
 gospel
 to
 all
 both
 Jew
 and
 Gentile
 Let
 the
 children
 first
 be
 filled
 He
 had
 said
 The
 resurrected
 Christ
 was
 to
 be
 made
 known
 to
 every
 nation
 but
 His
 personal
 ministry
 as
 a
 mortal
 as
 also
 that
 of
 the
 apostles
 while
 He
 was
 with
 them
 in
 the
 flesh
 was
 directed
 to
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 IN
 THE
 COASTS
 OF
 DECAPOLIS
 We
 are
 not
 told
 how
 long
 Jesus
 and
 the
 Twelve
 tarried
 in
 the
 land
 of
 Tyre
 and
 Sidon
 nor
 which
 portions
 of
 the
 district
 they
 traversed
 They
 went
 thence
 into
 the
 region
 adjoining
 the
 sea
 of
 Galilee
 on
 the
 east
 through
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 coasts
 of
 Decapolis
 Though
 still
 among
 semipagan
 peoples
 our
 Lord
 was
 greeted
 by
 great
 crowds
 amongst
 whom
 were
 many
 lame
 blind
 dumb
 maimed
 and
 otherwise
 afflicted
 and
 them
 He
 healed
 Great
 was
 the
 astonishment
 of
 these
 aliens
 when
 they
 saw
 the
 dumb
 to
 speak
 the
 maimed
 to
 be
 whole
 the
 lame
 to
 walk
 and
 the
 blind
 to
 see
 and
 they
 glorified
 the
 God
 of
 Israel
 Among
 the
 many
 who
 were
 healed
 was
 one
 of
 whom
 special
 mention
 is
 made
 He
 was
 deaf
 and
 defective
 in
 speech
 The
 people
 asked
 the
 Lord
 to
 lay
 His
 hands
 upon
 the
 man
 but
 Jesus
 led
 him
 away
 from
 the
 multitude
 put
 His
 fingers
 in
 the
 mans
 ears
 spat
 and
 touched
 the
 mans
 tongue
 then
 looking
 upward
 in
 prayer
 and
 sighing
 the
 while
 He
 uttered
 a
 word
 of
 command
 in
 Aramaic
 Ephphatha
 that
 is
 Be
 opened
 And
 straightway
 his
 ears
 were
 opened
 and
 the
 string
 of
 his
 tongue
 was
 loosed
 and
 he
 spake
 plain
 The
 manner
 of
 effecting
 this
 cure
 was
 different
 again
 from
 the
 usual
 mode
 of
 our
 Lords
 healing
 ministrations
 It
 may
 be
 that
 by
 the
 fingertouch
 to
 the
 closed
 ears
 and
 to
 the
 bound
 tongue
 the
 mans
 faith
 was
 strengthened
 and
 his
 confidence
 in
 the
 Masters
 power
 increased
 The
 people
 were
 forbidden
 to
 tell
 abroad
 what
 they
 had
 witnessed
 but
 the
 more
 they
 were
 charged
 the
 more
 they
 published
 the
 news
 Their
 conclusion
 as
 to
 Jesus
 and
 His
 works
 was
 He
 hath
 done
 all
 things
 well
 he
 maketh
 both
 the
 deaf
 to
 hear
 and
 the
 dumb
 to
 speak
 ANOTHER
 MEAL
 IN
 THE
 DESERT
 OVER
 FOUR
 THOUSAND
 FED
 For
 three
 days
 the
 glad
 crowds
 remained
 with
 Jesus
 and
 the
 apostles
 Camping
 out
 at
 that
 season
 and
 in
 that
 region
 entailed
 no
 great
 hardship
 incident
 to
 exposure
 Their
 supply
 of
 food
 however
 had
 become
 exhausted
 and
 many
 of
 them
 were
 far
 from
 home
 Jesus
 had
 compassion
 upon
 the
 people
 and
 was
 loath
 to
 send
 them
 away
 fasting
 lest
 they
 would
 faint
 by
 the
 way
 When
 He
 spoke
 to
 the
 disciples
 on
 the
 matter
 they
 intimated
 the
 impossibility
 of
 feeding
 so
 great
 a
 number
 for
 the
 entire
 stock
 of
 food
 at
 hand
 comprized
 but
 seven
 loaves
 and
 a
 few
 little
 fishes
 Had
 they
 forgotten
 the
 former
 occasion
 on
 which
 a
 greater
 multitude
 had
 been
 fed
 and
 filled
 with
 but
 five
 loaves
 and
 two
 small
 fishes
 Rather
 let
 us
 believe
 that
 the
 disciples
 remembered
 well
 yet
 deemed
 it
 beyond
 their
 duty
 or
 privilege
 to
 suggest
 a
 repetition
 of
 the
 miracle
 But
 the
 Master
 commanded
 and
 the
 people
 seated
 themselves
 on
 the
 ground
 Blessing
 and
 dividing
 the
 small
 provision
 as
 before
 He
 gave
 to
 the
 disciples
 and
 they
 distributed
 to
 the
 multitude
 Four
 thousand
 men
 beside
 women
 and
 children
 were
 abundantly
 fed
 and
 of
 the
 broken
 but
 uneaten
 food
 there
 remained
 enough
 to
 fill
 seven
 baskets
 With
 no
 semblance
 of
 the
 turbulent
 enthusiasm
 that
 had
 followed
 the
 feeding
 of
 the
 five
 thousand
 this
 multitude
 dispersed
 quietly
 and
 returned
 to
 their
 homes
 grateful
 and
 doubly
 blessed
 AGAIN
 BESET
 BY
 SIGNSEEKERS
 Jesus
 and
 the
 apostles
 returned
 by
 boat
 to
 the
 western
 shore
 of
 the
 lake
 and
 landed
 near
 Magdala
 and
 Dalmanutha
 These
 towns
 are
 understood
 to
 have
 been
 so
 close
 together
 as
 to
 virtually
 make
 the
 latter
 a
 suburb
 of
 the
 other
 Here
 the
 party
 was
 met
 by
 the
 evervigilant
 Pharisees
 who
 on
 this
 occasion
 were
 accompanied
 by
 their
 usually
 unfriendly
 rivals
 the
 Sadducees
 That
 the
 two
 parties
 had
 temporarily
 laid
 aside
 their
 mutual
 differences
 and
 had
 combined
 their
 forces
 in
 the
 common
 cause
 of
 opposition
 to
 Christ
 is
 a
 demonstration
 of
 the
 determined
 purpose
 of
 the
 ecclesiastical
 authorities
 to
 find
 occasion
 against
 Him
 and
 if
 possible
 destroy
 Him
 Their
 immediate
 object
 was
 to
 further
 alienate
 the
 common
 people
 and
 to
 counteract
 the
 influence
 of
 His
 former
 teachings
 with
 the
 masses
 They
 set
 anew
 the
 oldtime
 snare
 of
 demanding
 from
 Him
 a
 supernatural
 sign
 of
 His
 Messiahship
 though
 thrice
 already
 had
 they
 or
 others
 of
 their
 kind
 so
 attempted
 to
 entrap
 Him
 and
 thrice
 had
 they
 been
 foiled
 Before
 them
 Satan
 in
 person
 had
 similarly
 tried
 and
 failed
 To
 their
 present
 impertinent
 and
 impious
 demand
 He
 gave
 a
 brief
 and
 definite
 refusal
 coupled
 with
 an
 exposure
 of
 their
 hypocrisy
 This
 was
 His
 reply
 When
 it
 is
 evening
 ye
 say
 It
 will
 be
 fair
 weather
 for
 the
 sky
 is
 red
 And
 in
 the
 morning
 It
 will
 be
 foul
 weather
 today
 for
 the
 sky
 is
 red
 and
 lowring
 O
 ye
 hypocrites
 ye
 can
 discern
 the
 face
 of
 the
 sky
 but
 can
 ye
 not
 discern
 the
 signs
 of
 the
 times
 A
 wicked
 and
 adulterous
 generation
 seeketh
 after
 a
 sign
 and
 there
 shall
 no
 sign
 be
 given
 unto
 it
 but
 the
 sign
 of
 the
 prophet
 Jonas
 And
 he
 left
 them
 and
 departed
 THE
 LEAVEN
 OF
 THE
 PHARISEES
 AND
 OF
 THE
 SADDUCEES
 Again
 with
 the
 Twelve
 upon
 the
 water
 since
 on
 the
 Galilean
 coast
 neither
 peace
 nor
 opportunity
 for
 effective
 teaching
 was
 found
 Jesus
 directed
 the
 vessels
 course
 toward
 the
 northeasterly
 shore
 When
 well
 out
 from
 land
 He
 said
 to
 His
 companions
 Take
 heed
 and
 beware
 of
 the
 leaven
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 and
 of
 the
 Sadducees
 and
 as
 Mark
 adds
 and
 of
 the
 leaven
 of
 Herod
 In
 their
 hasty
 departure
 the
 disciples
 had
 forgotten
 to
 take
 a
 supply
 of
 food
 they
 had
 with
 them
 but
 a
 single
 loaf
 They
 construed
 His
 words
 respecting
 leaven
 as
 a
 reference
 to
 bread
 and
 possibly
 as
 a
 reproof
 for
 their
 neglect
 Jesus
 chided
 them
 as
 of
 little
 faith
 for
 thinking
 then
 of
 material
 bread
 and
 refreshed
 their
 recollection
 of
 the
 miracles
 by
 which
 the
 multitudes
 had
 been
 fed
 so
 that
 their
 lack
 of
 loaves
 would
 not
 further
 trouble
 them
 Finally
 they
 were
 made
 to
 understand
 that
 the
 Masters
 warning
 was
 directed
 against
 the
 false
 doctrines
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 and
 those
 of
 the
 Sadducees
 and
 against
 the
 political
 aspirations
 of
 the
 scheming
 Herodians
 The
 party
 left
 the
 boat
 near
 the
 site
 of
 the
 first
 miraculous
 feeding
 of
 the
 multitude
 and
 made
 their
 way
 to
 Bethsaida
 Julias
 A
 blind
 man
 was
 brought
 and
 Jesus
 was
 asked
 to
 touch
 him
 He
 took
 the
 sightless
 one
 by
 the
 hand
 led
 him
 outside
 the
 town
 applied
 saliva
 to
 his
 eyes
 laid
 hands
 upon
 him
 in
 a
 ministration
 and
 asked
 him
 if
 he
 could
 see
 The
 man
 answered
 that
 he
 saw
 dimly
 but
 was
 unable
 to
 distinguish
 men
 from
 trees
 Applying
 His
 hands
 to
 the
 mans
 eyes
 Jesus
 told
 him
 to
 look
 up
 the
 man
 did
 so
 and
 saw
 clearly
 Bidding
 him
 not
 to
 enter
 the
 town
 nor
 to
 tell
 of
 his
 deliverance
 from
 blindness
 to
 any
 in
 the
 place
 the
 Lord
 sent
 him
 away
 rejoicing
 This
 miracle
 presents
 the
 unique
 feature
 of
 Jesus
 healing
 a
 person
 by
 stages
 the
 result
 of
 the
 first
 ministration
 was
 but
 a
 partial
 recovery
 No
 explanation
 of
 the
 exceptional
 circumstance
 is
 given
 THOU
 ART
 THE
 CHRIST
 Accompanied
 by
 the
 Twelve
 Jesus
 continued
 His
 way
 northward
 to
 the
 neighborhood
 or
 coasts
 of
 Csarea
 Philippi
 an
 inland
 city
 situated
 near
 the
 eastern
 and
 principal
 source
 of
 the
 Jordan
 and
 near
 the
 foot
 of
 Mount
 Hermon
 The
 journey
 afforded
 opportunity
 for
 special
 and
 confidential
 instruction
 to
 the
 apostles
 Of
 them
 Jesus
 asked
 Whom
 do
 men
 say
 that
 I
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 am
 In
 reply
 they
 reported
 the
 rumors
 and
 popular
 fancies
 that
 had
 come
 to
 their
 notice
 Some
 people
 sharing
 the
 superstitious
 fears
 of
 the
 consciencestricken
 Herod
 Antipas
 said
 that
 Jesus
 was
 John
 the
 Baptist
 returned
 to
 life
 though
 such
 a
 belief
 could
 not
 have
 been
 entertained
 seriously
 by
 many
 as
 John
 and
 Jesus
 were
 known
 to
 have
 been
 contemporaries
 others
 said
 He
 was
 Elias
 or
 more
 exactly
 Elijah
 still
 others
 suggested
 He
 was
 Jeremiah
 or
 some
 other
 one
 of
 the
 ancient
 prophets
 of
 Israel
 It
 is
 significant
 that
 among
 all
 the
 conceptions
 of
 the
 people
 as
 to
 the
 identity
 of
 Jesus
 there
 was
 no
 intimation
 of
 belief
 that
 He
 was
 the
 Messiah
 Neither
 by
 word
 nor
 deed
 had
 He
 measured
 up
 to
 the
 popular
 and
 traditional
 standard
 of
 the
 expected
 Deliverer
 and
 King
 of
 Israel
 Fleeting
 manifestations
 of
 evanescent
 hope
 that
 He
 might
 prove
 to
 be
 the
 lookedfor
 Prophet
 like
 unto
 Moses
 had
 not
 been
 lacking
 but
 all
 such
 incipient
 conceptions
 had
 been
 neutralized
 by
 the
 hostile
 activity
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 and
 their
 kind
 To
 them
 it
 was
 a
 matter
 of
 supreme
 though
 evil
 determination
 to
 maintain
 in
 the
 minds
 of
 the
 people
 the
 thought
 of
 a
 yet
 future
 not
 a
 present
 Messiah
 With
 deep
 solemnity
 and
 as
 a
 soulsearching
 test
 for
 which
 the
 Twelve
 had
 been
 in
 unconscious
 preparation
 through
 many
 months
 of
 close
 and
 privileged
 companionship
 with
 their
 Lord
 Jesus
 asked
 of
 them
 But
 whom
 say
 ye
 that
 I
 am
 Answering
 for
 all
 but
 more
 particularly
 testifying
 as
 to
 his
 own
 conviction
 Peter
 with
 all
 the
 fervor
 of
 his
 soul
 voiced
 the
 great
 confession
 Thou
 art
 the
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 the
 living
 God
 This
 was
 no
 avowal
 of
 mere
 belief
 no
 expression
 of
 a
 result
 at
 which
 he
 had
 arrived
 by
 mental
 process
 no
 solution
 of
 a
 problem
 laboriously
 worked
 out
 no
 verdict
 based
 on
 the
 weighing
 of
 evidence
 he
 spoke
 in
 the
 sure
 knowledge
 that
 knows
 no
 question
 and
 from
 which
 doubt
 and
 reservation
 are
 as
 far
 removed
 as
 is
 the
 sky
 from
 the
 ground
 And
 Jesus
 answered
 and
 said
 unto
 him
 Blessed
 art
 thou
 Simon
 Barjona
 for
 flesh
 and
 blood
 hath
 not
 revealed
 it
 unto
 thee
 but
 my
 Father
 which
 is
 in
 heaven
 Peters
 knowledge
 which
 was
 also
 that
 of
 his
 brethren
 was
 of
 a
 kind
 apart
 from
 all
 that
 man
 may
 find
 out
 for
 himself
 it
 was
 a
 divine
 bestowal
 in
 comparison
 with
 which
 human
 wisdom
 is
 foolishness
 and
 the
 treasure
 of
 earth
 but
 dross
 Addressing
 Himself
 further
 to
 the
 first
 of
 the
 apostles
 Jesus
 continued
 And
 I
 say
 also
 unto
 thee
 That
 thou
 art
 Peter
 and
 upon
 this
 rock
 I
 will
 build
 my
 church
 and
 the
 gates
 of
 hell
 shall
 not
 prevail
 against
 it
 And
 I
 will
 give
 unto
 thee
 the
 keys
 of
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 and
 whatsoever
 thou
 shalt
 bind
 on
 earth
 shall
 be
 bound
 in
 heaven
 and
 whatsoever
 thou
 shalt
 loose
 on
 earth
 shall
 be
 loosed
 in
 heaven
 Through
 direct
 revelation
 from
 God
 Peter
 knew
 that
 Jesus
 was
 the
 Christ
 and
 upon
 revelation
 as
 a
 rock
 of
 secure
 foundation
 the
 Church
 of
 Christ
 was
 to
 be
 built
 Though
 torrents
 should
 fall
 floods
 roll
 winds
 rage
 and
 all
 beat
 together
 upon
 that
 structure
 it
 would
 not
 could
 not
 fall
 for
 it
 was
 founded
 upon
 a
 rock
 and
 even
 the
 powers
 of
 hell
 would
 be
 impotent
 to
 prevail
 against
 it
 By
 revelation
 alone
 could
 or
 can
 the
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 be
 builded
 and
 maintained
 and
 revelation
 of
 necessity
 implies
 revelators
 through
 whom
 the
 will
 of
 God
 may
 be
 made
 known
 respecting
 His
 Church
 As
 a
 gift
 from
 God
 comes
 the
 testimony
 of
 Jesus
 into
 the
 heart
 of
 man
 This
 principle
 was
 comprized
 in
 the
 Masters
 teachings
 at
 Capernaum
 that
 none
 could
 come
 to
 Him
 save
 such
 as
 the
 Father
 would
 bring
 The
 Lords
 promise
 that
 unto
 Peter
 He
 would
 give
 the
 keys
 of
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 embodies
 the
 principle
 of
 divine
 authority
 in
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 and
 of
 the
 commission
 of
 presidency
 Allusion
 to
 keys
 as
 symbolical
 of
 power
 and
 authority
 is
 not
 uncommon
 in
 Jewish
 literature
 as
 was
 well
 understood
 in
 that
 period
 and
 is
 generally
 current
 today
 So
 also
 the
 analogies
 of
 binding
 and
 loosing
 as
 indicative
 of
 official
 acts
 were
 then
 usual
 as
 they
 are
 now
 particularly
 in
 connection
 with
 judicial
 functions
 Peters
 presidency
 among
 the
 apostles
 was
 abundantly
 manifest
 and
 generally
 recognized
 after
 the
 close
 of
 our
 Lords
 mortal
 life
 Thus
 it
 was
 he
 who
 spoke
 in
 behalf
 of
 the
 Eleven
 in
 the
 council
 meeting
 at
 which
 a
 successor
 to
 the
 traitor
 Iscariot
 was
 chosen
 he
 was
 the
 spokesman
 of
 his
 brethren
 on
 the
 occasion
 of
 the
 Pentecostal
 conversion
 it
 was
 he
 who
 opened
 the
 doors
 of
 the
 Church
 to
 the
 Gentiles
 and
 his
 office
 of
 leadership
 is
 apparent
 throughout
 the
 apostolic
 period
 The
 confession
 by
 which
 the
 apostles
 avowed
 their
 acceptance
 of
 Jesus
 as
 the
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 the
 living
 God
 was
 evidence
 of
 their
 actual
 possession
 of
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 Holy
 Apostleship
 by
 which
 they
 were
 made
 particular
 witnesses
 of
 their
 Lord
 The
 time
 for
 a
 general
 proclamation
 of
 their
 testimony
 had
 not
 arrived
 however
 nor
 did
 it
 come
 until
 after
 Christ
 had
 emerged
 from
 the
 tomb
 a
 resurrected
 immortalized
 Personage
 For
 the
 time
 being
 they
 were
 charged
 that
 they
 should
 tell
 no
 man
 that
 he
 was
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 Proclamation
 of
 Jesus
 as
 the
 Messiah
 particularly
 if
 made
 by
 the
 apostles
 who
 were
 publicly
 known
 as
 His
 most
 intimate
 disciples
 and
 associates
 or
 open
 assumption
 of
 the
 Messianic
 title
 by
 Himself
 would
 have
 aggravated
 the
 hostility
 of
 the
 rulers
 which
 had
 already
 become
 a
 grave
 interference
 if
 not
 an
 actual
 menace
 to
 the
 Saviors
 ministry
 and
 seditious
 uprisings
 against
 the
 political
 government
 of
 Rome
 might
 easily
 have
 resulted
 A
 yet
 deeper
 reason
 for
 the
 secrecy
 enjoined
 upon
 the
 Twelve
 appears
 in
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 Jewish
 nation
 was
 not
 prepared
 to
 accept
 their
 Lord
 and
 to
 ignore
 Him
 through
 lack
 of
 certain
 knowledge
 involved
 a
 lesser
 degree
 of
 culpability
 than
 would
 have
 attached
 to
 an
 unpalliated
 rejection
 The
 particular
 mission
 of
 the
 apostles
 at
 a
 time
 then
 future
 was
 to
 proclaim
 to
 all
 nations
 Jesus
 the
 crucified
 and
 resurrected
 Christ
 From
 the
 time
 of
 Peters
 confession
 however
 Jesus
 instructed
 the
 Twelve
 more
 plainly
 and
 with
 greater
 intimacy
 concerning
 the
 future
 developments
 of
 His
 mission
 and
 particularly
 as
 touching
 His
 appointed
 death
 On
 earlier
 occasions
 He
 had
 referred
 in
 their
 hearing
 to
 the
 cross
 and
 to
 His
 approaching
 death
 burial
 and
 ascension
 but
 the
 mention
 in
 each
 case
 was
 in
 a
 measure
 figurative
 and
 they
 had
 apprehended
 but
 imperfectly
 if
 at
 all
 Now
 however
 He
 began
 to
 show
 and
 often
 afterward
 made
 plain
 unto
 them
 how
 that
 he
 must
 go
 unto
 Jerusalem
 and
 suffer
 many
 things
 of
 the
 elders
 and
 chief
 priests
 and
 scribes
 and
 be
 killed
 and
 be
 raised
 again
 the
 third
 day
 Peter
 was
 shocked
 at
 this
 unqualified
 declaration
 and
 yielding
 to
 impulse
 remonstrated
 with
 Jesus
 or
 as
 two
 of
 the
 evangelists
 state
 began
 to
 rebuke
 him
 even
 going
 so
 far
 as
 to
 say
 This
 shall
 not
 be
 unto
 thee
 The
 Lord
 turned
 upon
 him
 with
 this
 sharp
 reproof
 Get
 thee
 behind
 me
 Satan
 thou
 art
 an
 offence
 unto
 me
 for
 thou
 savourest
 not
 the
 things
 that
 be
 of
 God
 but
 those
 that
 be
 of
 men
 Peters
 words
 constituted
 an
 appeal
 to
 the
 human
 element
 in
 Christs
 nature
 and
 the
 sensitive
 feelings
 of
 Jesus
 were
 wounded
 by
 this
 suggestion
 of
 unfaithfulness
 to
 His
 trust
 coming
 from
 the
 man
 whom
 He
 had
 so
 signally
 honored
 but
 a
 few
 moments
 before
 Peter
 saw
 mainly
 as
 men
 see
 understanding
 but
 imperfectly
 the
 deeper
 purposes
 of
 God
 Though
 deserved
 the
 rebuke
 he
 received
 was
 severe
 The
 adjuration
 Get
 thee
 behind
 me
 Satan
 was
 identical
 with
 that
 used
 against
 the
 archtempter
 himself
 who
 had
 sought
 to
 beguile
 Jesus
 from
 the
 path
 upon
 which
 He
 had
 entered
 and
 the
 provocation
 in
 the
 two
 instances
 was
 in
 some
 respects
 similarthe
 temptation
 to
 evade
 sacrifice
 and
 suffering
 though
 such
 was
 the
 worlds
 ransom
 and
 to
 follow
 a
 more
 comfortable
 way
 The
 forceful
 words
 of
 Jesus
 show
 the
 deep
 emotion
 that
 Peters
 illconsidered
 attempt
 to
 counsel
 if
 not
 to
 tempt
 his
 Lord
 had
 evoked
 Beside
 the
 Twelve
 who
 were
 immediately
 about
 the
 Lords
 person
 others
 were
 nearby
 it
 appears
 that
 even
 in
 those
 remote
 parts
 far
 removed
 from
 the
 borders
 of
 Galileethe
 habitat
 of
 a
 heathen
 population
 with
 whom
 however
 many
 Jews
 were
 intermixedthe
 people
 gathered
 around
 the
 Master
 These
 He
 now
 called
 together
 and
 to
 them
 and
 the
 disciples
 said
 If
 any
 man
 will
 come
 after
 me
 let
 him
 deny
 himself
 and
 take
 up
 his
 cross
 and
 follow
 me
 Here
 the
 frightful
 figure
 of
 the
 cross
 was
 again
 made
 prominent
 There
 was
 left
 no
 shadow
 of
 excuse
 for
 the
 thought
 that
 devotion
 to
 Christ
 would
 not
 mean
 denial
 and
 privation
 He
 who
 would
 save
 his
 life
 at
 the
 cost
 of
 duty
 as
 Peter
 had
 just
 suggested
 that
 Christ
 should
 do
 would
 surely
 lose
 it
 in
 a
 sense
 worse
 than
 that
 of
 physical
 death
 whereas
 he
 who
 stood
 willing
 to
 lose
 all
 even
 life
 itself
 should
 find
 the
 life
 that
 is
 eternal
 As
 evincing
 the
 soundness
 of
 His
 teachings
 Jesus
 uttered
 what
 has
 since
 become
 an
 inspiring
 aphorism
 of
 life
 For
 what
 is
 a
 man
 profited
 if
 he
 shall
 gain
 the
 whole
 world
 and
 lose
 his
 own
 soul
 or
 what
 shall
 a
 man
 give
 in
 exchange
 for
 his
 soul
 Whosoever
 is
 ashamed
 of
 Christ
 because
 of
 His
 lowly
 estate
 or
 through
 offense
 at
 His
 teachings
 shall
 yet
 find
 that
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 when
 He
 comes
 in
 the
 glory
 of
 the
 Father
 with
 attending
 cohorts
 of
 angels
 will
 be
 ashamed
 of
 that
 man
 The
 record
 of
 this
 memorable
 day
 in
 the
 Saviors
 life
 closes
 with
 His
 blessed
 promise
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 There
 be
 some
 standing
 here
 which
 shall
 not
 taste
 of
 death
 till
 they
 see
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 coming
 in
 his
 kingdom
 NOTES

 CHAPTER
 
 
 Passover
 Celebrations
 Comprized
 within
 the
 Period
 of
 Our
 Lords
 Public
 MinistryThe
 dates
 on
 which
 specific
 acts
 occurred
 in
 the
 ministry
 of
 Jesus
 are
 difficult
 if
 not
 impossible
 to
 fix
 except
 in
 few
 instances
 and
 as
 heretofore
 stated
 and
 reiterated
 even
 the
 order
 of
 events
 is
 often
 found
 to
 be
 uncertain
 It
 will
 be
 remembered
 that
 Jesus
 was
 in
 Jerusalem
 at
 the
 time
 of
 the
 Passover
 soon
 after
 His
 baptism
 and
 that
 on
 the
 visit
 referred
 to
 He
 forcibly
 cleared
 the
 temple
 courts
 of
 traffickers
 and
 their
 property
 This
 is
 known
 as
 the
 first
 Passover
 during
 the
 public
 life
 of
 Jesus
 If
 the
 unnamed
 feast
 of
 the
 Jews
 referred
 to
 by
 John
 
 was
 a
 Passover
 as
 many
 Bible
 students
 hold
 it
 marked
 the
 close
 of
 the
 year
 following
 the
 cleansing
 the
 temple
 it
 is
 commonly
 spoken
 of
 and
 written
 about
 as
 the
 second
 Passover
 in
 the
 course
 of
 our
 Lords
 ministry
 Then
 the
 Passover
 near
 which
 Jesus
 fed
 the
 five
 thousand
 John
 
 would
 be
 the
 third
 and
 would
 mark
 the
 expiration
 of
 two
 years
 and
 a
 fraction
 since
 the
 baptism
 of
 Jesus
 it
 certainly
 marks
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 last
 year
 of
 the
 Saviors
 life
 on
 earth
 
 Ceremonial
 AblutionsThe
 numerous
 washings
 required
 by
 Jewish
 custom
 in
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 were
 admittedly
 incident
 to
 rabbinism
 and
 the
 tradition
 of
 the
 elders
 and
 not
 in
 compliance
 with
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 Under
 certain
 conditions
 successive
 washings
 were
 prescribed
 in
 connection
 with
 which
 we
 find
 mention
 of
 first
 second
 and
 other
 waters
 the
 second
 water
 being
 necessary
 to
 wash
 away
 the
 first
 water
 which
 had
 become
 defiled
 by
 contact
 with
 the
 common
 hands
 and
 so
 further
 with
 the
 later
 waters
 Sometimes
 the
 hands
 had
 to
 be
 dipped
 or
 immersed
 at
 other
 times
 they
 were
 to
 be
 cleansed
 by
 pouring
 it
 being
 necessary
 that
 the
 water
 be
 allowed
 to
 run
 to
 the
 wrist
 or
 the
 elbow
 according
 to
 the
 degree
 of
 supposed
 defilement
 then
 again
 as
 the
 disciples
 of
 Rabbi
 Shammai
 held
 only
 the
 finger
 tips
 or
 the
 fingers
 up
 to
 the
 knuckles
 needed
 to
 be
 wetted
 under
 particular
 circumstances
 Rules
 for
 the
 cleansing
 of
 vessels
 and
 furniture
 were
 detailed
 and
 exacting
 distinct
 methods
 applied
 respectively
 to
 vessels
 of
 clay
 wood
 and
 metal
 Fear
 of
 unwittingly
 defiling
 the
 hands
 led
 to
 many
 extreme
 precautions
 It
 being
 known
 that
 the
 Roll
 of
 the
 Law
 the
 Roll
 of
 the
 Prophets
 and
 other
 scriptures
 when
 laid
 away
 were
 sometimes
 touched
 scratched
 or
 even
 gnawed
 by
 mice
 there
 was
 issued
 a
 rabbinical
 decree
 that
 the
 Holy
 Scriptures
 or
 any
 part
 thereof
 comprizing
 as
 many
 as
 eightyfive
 letters
 the
 shortest
 section
 in
 the
 law
 having
 just
 that
 number
 defiled
 the
 hands
 by
 mere
 contact
 Thus
 the
 hands
 had
 to
 be
 ceremonially
 cleansed
 after
 touching
 a
 copy
 of
 the
 scriptures
 or
 even
 a
 written
 passage
 therefrom
 Emancipation
 from
 these
 and
 many
 such
 like
 things
 must
 have
 been
 relief
 indeed
 Escape
 from
 this
 thraldom
 Jesus
 freely
 offered
 saying
 Come
 unto
 me
 all
 ye
 that
 labour
 and
 are
 heavy
 laden
 and
 I
 will
 give
 you
 rest
 Take
 my
 yoke
 upon
 you
 and
 learn
 of
 me
 for
 I
 am
 meek
 and
 lowly
 in
 heart
 and
 ye
 shall
 find
 rest
 unto
 your
 souls
 For
 my
 yoke
 is
 easy
 and
 my
 burden
 is
 light
 Matt
 
 
 Corban
 a
 GiftThe
 law
 of
 Moses
 prescribed
 rules
 relating
 to
 vows
 Lev
 
 Numb
 
 Upon
 these
 rules
 says
 the
 writer
 in
 Smiths
 Bible
 Dict
 the
 traditionalists
 enlarged
 and
 laid
 down
 that
 a
 man
 might
 interdict
 himself
 by
 vow
 not
 only
 from
 using
 for
 himself
 but
 from
 giving
 to
 another
 or
 receiving
 from
 him
 some
 particular
 object
 whether
 of
 food
 or
 any
 other
 kind
 whatsoever
 The
 thing
 thus
 interdicted
 was
 considered
 as
 corban
 A
 person
 might
 thus
 exempt
 himself
 from
 any
 inconvenient
 obligation
 under
 plea
 of
 corban
 Our
 Lord
 denounced
 practises
 of
 this
 sort
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 as
 annulling
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 law
 The
 revised
 version
 Matt
 
 is
 made
 to
 read
 But
 ye
 say
 Whosoever
 shall
 say
 to
 his
 father
 or
 his
 mother
 That
 wherewith
 thou
 mightest
 have
 been
 profited
 by
 me
 is
 given
 to
 God
 he
 shall
 not
 honor
 his
 father
 or
 his
 mother
 The
 following
 account
 of
 this
 pernicious
 custom
 appears
 in
 the
 Commentary
 on
 The
 Holy
 Bible
 edited
 by
 Dummelow
 Corban
 meaning
 originally
 a
 sacrifice
 or
 a
 gift
 to
 God
 was
 used
 in
 New
 Testament
 times
 as
 a
 mere
 word
 of
 vowing
 without
 implying
 that
 the
 thing
 vowed
 would
 actually
 be
 offered
 or
 given
 to
 God
 Thus
 a
 man
 would
 say
 Corban
 to
 me
 is
 wine
 for
 such
 a
 time
 meaning
 that
 he
 took
 a
 vow
 to
 abstain
 from
 wine
 Or
 a
 man
 would
 say
 to
 a
 friend
 Corban
 to
 me
 for
 such
 a
 time
 is
 whatsoever
 I
 might
 be
 profited
 by
 thee
 meaning
 that
 for
 such
 a
 time
 he
 vowed
 that
 he
 would
 receive
 neither
 hospitality
 nor
 any
 other
 benefit
 from
 his
 friend
 Similarly
 if
 a
 son
 said
 to
 his
 father
 or
 mother
 Corban
 is
 whatsoever
 thou
 mightest
 have
 profited
 by
 me
 he
 took
 a
 vow
 not
 to
 assist
 his
 father
 or
 mother
 in
 any
 way
 however
 much
 they
 might
 require
 it
 A
 vow
 of
 this
 kind
 was
 held
 by
 the
 scribes
 to
 excuse
 a
 man
 from
 the
 duty
 of
 supporting
 his
 parents
 and
 thus
 by
 their
 tradition
 they
 made
 void
 the
 word
 of
 God
 
 The
 Dogs
 that
 Eat
 of
 the
 CrumbsThe
 womans
 fervid
 rejoinder
 Truth
 Lord
 yet
 the
 dogs
 eat
 of
 the
 crumbs
 which
 fall
 from
 their
 masters
 table
 Matt
 
 is
 thus
 commented
 upon
 and
 paraphrased
 by
 Trench
 Notes
 on
 the
 Miracles
 p
 
 The
 rendering
 of
 her
 answer
 in
 our
 translation
 is
 not
 however
 altogether
 satisfactory
 For
 indeed
 she
 accepts
 the
 Lords
 declaration
 not
 immediately
 to
 make
 exception
 against
 the
 conclusion
 which
 He
 draws
 from
 it
 but
 to
 show
 how
 in
 that
 very
 declaration
 is
 involved
 the
 granting
 of
 her
 petition
 Saidest
 thou
 dogs
 It
 is
 well
 I
 accept
 the
 title
 and
 the
 place
 for
 the
 dogs
 have
 a
 portion
 of
 the
 mealnot
 the
 first
 not
 the
 childrens
 portion
 but
 a
 portion
 stillthe
 crumbs
 which
 fall
 from
 the
 masters
 table
 In
 this
 very
 putting
 of
 the
 case
 Thou
 bringest
 us
 heathen
 Thou
 bringest
 me
 within
 the
 circle
 of
 the
 blessings
 which
 God
 the
 Great
 Householder
 is
 ever
 dispensing
 to
 His
 family
 We
 also
 belong
 to
 His
 household
 though
 we
 occupy
 but
 the
 lowest
 place
 therein
 The
 Dummelow
 Commentary
 on
 Matt
 
 reads
 in
 part
 as
 follows
 The
 rabbis
 often
 spoke
 of
 the
 Gentiles
 as
 dogs
 eg
 He
 who
 eats
 with
 an
 idolater
 is
 like
 one
 who
 eats
 with
 a
 dog
 
 The
 nations
 of
 the
 world
 are
 compared
 to
 dogs
 The
 holy
 convocation
 belongs
 to
 you
 not
 to
 the
 dogs
 Yet
 Jesus
 in
 adopting
 the
 contemptuous
 expression
 slightly
 softens
 it
 He
 says
 not
 dogs
 but
 little
 dogs
 ie
 household
 favorite
 dogs
 and
 the
 woman
 cleverly
 catches
 at
 the
 expression
 arguing
 that
 if
 the
 Gentiles
 are
 household
 dogs
 then
 it
 is
 only
 right
 that
 they
 should
 be
 fed
 with
 the
 crumbs
 that
 fall
 from
 their
 masters
 table
 Edersheim
 referring
 to
 the
 original
 text
 says
 The
 term
 means
 little
 dogs
 or
 house
 dogs
 
 DecapolisThe
 name
 means
 the
 ten
 cities
 and
 was
 applied
 to
 a
 region
 of
 indefinite
 boundaries
 lying
 mostly
 on
 the
 east
 of
 Jordan
 and
 southerly
 from
 the
 sea
 of
 Galilee
 Scythopolis
 which
 Josephus
 Wars
 of
 the
 Jews
 iii
 
 refers
 to
 as
 the
 largest
 of
 the
 ten
 cities
 was
 on
 the
 west
 side
 of
 the
 river
 There
 is
 lack
 of
 agreement
 among
 historians
 as
 to
 the
 cities
 comprized
 under
 the
 name
 Biblical
 mention
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 
 implies
 a
 general
 region
 rather
 than
 a
 definite
 area
 
 The
 Coasts
 of
 Csarea
 PhilippiThe
 term
 coast
 as
 it
 appears
 in
 the
 Bible
 authorized
 or
 King
 James
 version
 is
 used
 to
 connote
 boundary
 limit
 or
 border
 and
 not
 distinctively
 a
 seashore
 For
 examples
 see
 Exo
 
 
 
 Josh
 
 
 Judg
 
 Matt
 
 etc
 It
 is
 applied
 therefore
 to
 inland
 areas
 and
 frequently
 occurs
 as
 indicating
 a
 vicinity
 or
 neighborhood
 Csarea
 Philippi
 a
 town
 located
 as
 stated
 in
 the
 text
 near
 Mount
 Hermon
 at
 the
 source
 of
 the
 Jordan
 had
 been
 enlarged
 and
 beautified
 by
 Philip
 the
 tetrarch
 and
 by
 him
 was
 named
 Csarea
 in
 honor
 of
 the
 Roman
 emperor
 It
 was
 called
 Csarea
 Philippi
 to
 distinguish
 it
 from
 the
 already
 existing
 Csarea
 which
 was
 situated
 on
 the
 Mediterranean
 shore
 of
 Samaria
 and
 which
 in
 later
 literature
 came
 to
 be
 known
 as
 Csarea
 Palestina
 Csarea
 Philippi
 is
 believed
 to
 be
 identical
 with
 the
 ancient
 Baal
 Gad
 Josh
 
 and
 Baal
 Hermon
 Judg
 
 It
 was
 known
 as
 a
 place
 of
 idolatrous
 worship
 and
 while
 under
 Greek
 sovereignty
 was
 called
 Paneas
 in
 recognition
 of
 the
 mythological
 deity
 Pan
 See

 designation

 In
 the
 course

 the
 general
 apostasy
 subsequent
 to
 the
 ancient
 apostolic
 ministry
 the
 Bishop
 of
 Rome
 laid
 claim
 to
 supreme
 authority
 as
 the
 alleged
 lineal
 successor
 to
 Peter
 and
 an
 erroneous
 doctrine
 gained
 currency
 to
 the
 effect
 that
 Peter
 was
 the
 rock
 upon
 which
 the
 Church
 of
 Christ
 was
 founded
 Detailed
 consideration
 of
 this
 inconsistent
 and
 infamous
 claim
 cannot
 be
 undertaken
 here
 it
 is
 sufficient
 to
 say
 that
 a
 church
 founded
 or
 dependent
 upon
 Peter
 or
 any
 other
 man
 would
 be
 Peters
 or
 the
 other
 mans
 church
 and
 not
 the

 That
 upon
 Peter
 rested
 the
 responsibility
 of
 presidency
 in
 the
 ministry
 after
 the
 ascension
 of
 the
 resurrected
 Christ
 is
 not
 questioned
 but
 that
 he
 was
 even
 typically
 the
 foundation
 upon
 which
 the
 Church
 was
 built
 is
 at
 once
 unscriptural
 and
 untrue
 The
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 must
 authoritatively
 bear
 His
 name
 and
 be
 guided
 by
 revelation
 direct
 and
 continuous
 as
 the
 conditions

 Christs
 Rebuke
 to
 PeterIn
 addressing
 Peter
 as
 Satan
 Jesus
 was
 obviously
 using
 a
 forceful
 figure
 of
 speech
 and
 not
 a
 literal
 designation
 for
 Satan
 is
 a
 distinct
 personage
 Lucifer
 that
 fallen
 unembodied
 son
 of
 the
 morning
 see

 and
 certainly
 Peter
 was
 not
 he
 In
 his
 remonstrance

 rebuke
 addressed
 to
 Jesus
 Peter
 was
 really
 counseling
 what
 Satan
 had
 before
 attempted
 to
 induce
 Christ
 to
 do
 or
 tempting
 as
 Satan
 himself
 had
 tempted
 The
 command
 Get
 thee
 behind

 Satan
 as
 directed
 to
 Peter
 is
 rendered
 in
 English
 by
 some
 authorities
 Get
 thee
 behind
 me
 tempter
 The
 essential
 meaning
 attached
 to
 both
 Hebrew
 and
 Greek
 originals
 for
 our
 word
 Satan
 is
 that
 of
 an
 adversary
 or
 one
 who
 places
 himself
 in
 anothers
 way
 and
 thus
 opposes
 him
 Zenos

 expression

 declaration
 to
 the

 and
 others
 in

 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 There
 be
 some
 standing

 till

 see
 the
 Son
 of
 man

 Matt

 The

 referred
 to
 that
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 coming
 in
 the
 glory
 of
 His
 Father
 attended

 is
 yet
 future
 At
 least
 a
 partial
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 prediction
 is
 presented
 in
 the
 prolongation
 of
 the
 life
 of
 John

 Thou
 Art
 the
 ChristPeters
 solemn
 and
 soulful
 confession
 of
 Jesus
 as
 the
 Christ
 is
 worded
 differently
 by
 each
 of
 the
 three
 synoptists
 To
 many
 the
 most
 expressive
 version
 is
 that
 of
 Luke
 The
 Christ
 of
 God
 On
 earlier
 occasions
 some
 or
 all
 of
 the
 Twelve
 had
 acknowledged
 Jesus
 Christ
 to
 be
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 eg
 following
 the
 miracle
 of
 walking
 upon
 the
 sea
 Matt
 
 and
 again
 after
 the
 crucial
 sermon
 at
 Capernaum
 John
 
 but
 it
 is
 evident
 that
 Peters
 upwelling
 and
 reverential
 confession
 in
 answer
 to
 the
 Lords
 question
 But
 whom
 say
 ye
 that
 I
 am
 had
 a
 significance
 greater
 in
 assurance
 and
 more
 exalted
 in
 kind
 than
 had
 any
 prior
 expression
 of
 his
 conception
 concerning
 his
 Lord
 Yet
 even
 the
 conviction
 given
 through
 direct
 revelation
 Matt
 
 did
 not
 at
 the
 time
 comprize
 a
 comprehensive
 knowledge
 of
 the
 Saviors
 mission
 Indeed
 a
 fulness
 of
 understanding
 and
 assurance
 came
 to
 the
 apostles
 after
 the
 Lords
 resurrection
 compare
 Romans
 
 Nevertheless
 Peters
 testimony
 in
 the
 land
 of
 Csarea
 Philippi
 evidences
 a
 very
 exalted
 attainment
 At
 that
 stage
 of
 the
 Saviors
 ministry
 the
 public
 proclamation
 of
 His
 divine
 status
 would
 have
 been
 as
 the
 casting
 of
 pearls
 before
 swine
 Matt
 
 therefore
 the
 Lord
 instructed
 the
 apostles
 that
 at
 that
 time
 they
 should
 tell
 no
 man
 that
 he
 was
 Jesus
 the
 Christ

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 TRANSFIGURATION
 Of
 the
 week
 following
 the
 events
 last
 considered
 no
 record
 is
 found
 in
 the
 Gospels
 We
 may
 safely
 assume
 that
 the
 time
 was
 devoted
 in
 part
 at
 least
 to
 the
 further
 instruction
 of
 the
 Twelve
 respecting
 the
 rapidly
 approaching
 consummation
 of
 the
 Saviors
 mission
 on
 earth
 the
 awful
 circumstances
 of
 which
 the
 apostles
 were
 loath
 to
 believe
 possible
 When
 the
 week
 had
 passed
 Jesus
 took
 Peter
 James
 and
 John
 and
 with
 them
 ascended
 a
 high
 mountain
 where
 they
 would
 be
 reasonably
 safe
 from
 human
 intrusion
 There
 the
 three
 apostles
 witnessed
 a
 heavenly
 manifestation
 which
 stands
 without
 parallel
 in
 history
 in
 our
 Bible
 captions
 it
 is
 known
 as
 the
 Transfiguration
 of
 Christ
 One
 purpose
 of
 the
 Lords
 retirement
 was
 that
 of
 prayer
 and
 a
 transcendent
 investiture
 of
 glory
 came
 upon
 Him
 as
 He
 prayed
 The
 apostles
 had
 fallen
 asleep
 but
 were
 awakened
 by
 the
 surpassing
 splendor
 of
 the
 scene
 and
 gazed
 with
 reverent
 awe
 upon
 their
 glorified
 Lord
 The
 fashion
 of
 his
 countenance
 was
 altered
 and
 his
 raiment
 was
 white
 and
 glistering
 His
 garments
 though
 made
 of
 earthwoven
 fabric
 became
 shining
 exceeding
 white
 as
 snow
 so
 as
 no
 fuller
 on
 earth
 can
 white
 them
 and
 his
 face
 did
 shine
 as
 the
 sun
 Thus
 was
 Jesus
 transfigured
 before
 the
 three
 privileged
 witnesses
 With
 Him
 were
 two
 other
 personages
 who
 also
 were
 in
 a
 state
 of
 glorified
 radiance
 and
 who
 conversed
 with
 the
 Lord
 These
 as
 the
 apostles
 learned
 by
 means
 not
 stated
 though
 probably
 as
 gathered
 from
 the
 conversation
 in
 progress
 were
 Moses
 and
 Elias
 or
 more
 literally
 to
 us
 Elijah
 and
 the
 subject
 of
 their
 conference
 with
 Christ
 was
 his
 decease
 which
 he
 should
 accomplish
 at
 Jerusalem
 As
 the
 prophet
 visitants
 were
 about
 to
 depart
 Peter
 said
 unto
 Jesus
 Master
 it
 is
 good
 for
 us
 to
 be
 here
 and
 let
 us
 make
 three
 tabernacles
 one
 for
 thee
 and
 one
 for
 Moses
 and
 one
 for
 Elias
 not
 knowing
 what
 he
 said
 Undoubtedly
 Peter
 and
 his
 fellow
 apostles
 were
 bewildered
 sore
 afraid
 indeed
 and
 this
 condition
 may
 explain
 the
 suggestion
 respecting
 the
 three
 tabernacles
 He
 wist
 not
 what
 to
 say
 yet
 though
 his
 remark
 appears
 confused
 and
 obscure
 it
 becomes
 somewhat
 plainer
 when
 we
 remember
 that
 at
 the
 annual
 feast
 of
 Tabernacles
 it
 was
 customary
 to
 erect
 a
 little
 bower
 or
 booth
 of
 wattled
 boughs
 for
 each
 individual
 worshiper
 into
 which
 he
 might
 retire
 for
 devotion
 So
 far
 as
 there
 was
 a
 purpose
 in
 Peters
 proposition
 it
 seems
 to
 have
 been
 that
 of
 delaying
 the
 departure
 of
 the
 visitants
 The
 sublime
 and
 awful
 solemnity
 of
 the
 occasion
 had
 not
 yet
 reached
 its
 climax
 Even
 as
 Peter
 spake
 behold
 a
 bright
 cloud
 overshadowed
 them
 and
 behold
 a
 voice
 out
 of
 the
 cloud
 which
 said
 This
 is
 my
 beloved
 Son
 in
 whom
 I
 am
 well
 pleased
 hear
 ye
 him
 It
 was
 Elohim
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 who
 spake
 and
 at
 the
 sound
 of
 that
 voice
 of
 supreme
 Majesty
 the
 apostles
 fell
 prostrate
 Jesus
 came
 and
 touched
 them
 saying
 Arise
 and
 be
 not
 afraid
 When
 they
 looked
 they
 saw
 that
 again
 they
 were
 alone
 with
 Him
 The
 impression
 made
 upon
 the
 three
 apostles
 by
 this
 manifestation
 was
 one
 never
 to
 be
 forgotten
 but
 they
 were
 expressly
 charged
 to
 speak
 of
 it
 to
 no
 man
 until
 after
 the
 Savior
 had
 risen
 from
 the
 dead
 They
 were
 puzzled
 as
 to
 the
 significance
 of
 the
 Lords
 reference
 to
 His
 prospective
 rising
 from
 the
 dead
 They
 had
 heard
 with
 great
 sorrow
 and
 reluctantly
 they
 were
 being
 brought
 to
 understand
 it
 to
 be
 an
 awful
 certainty
 that
 their
 beloved
 Master
 was
 to
 suffer
 many
 things
 and
 be
 rejected
 of
 the
 elders
 and
 of
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 scribes
 and
 be
 killed
 Such
 had
 been
 declared
 to
 them
 before
 in
 language
 devoid
 of
 ambiguity
 and
 admitting
 of
 no
 figurative
 construction
 and
 with
 equal
 plainness
 they
 had
 been
 told
 that
 Jesus
 would
 rise
 again
 but
 of
 this
 latter
 eventuality
 they
 had
 but
 dim
 comprehension
 The
 present
 reiteration
 of
 these
 teachings
 seems
 to
 have
 left
 the
 three
 with
 no
 clearer
 understanding
 of
 their
 Lords
 resurrection
 from
 the
 dead
 than
 they
 had
 before
 They
 seem
 to
 have
 had
 no
 definite
 conception
 as
 to
 what
 was
 meant
 by
 a
 resurrection
 And
 they
 kept
 that
 saying
 with
 themselves
 questioning
 one
 with
 another
 what
 the
 rising
 from
 the
 dead
 should
 mean
 The
 comprehensiveness
 of
 the
 Lords
 injunction
 that
 until
 after
 His
 rising
 from
 the
 dead
 they
 tell
 no
 man
 of
 their
 experiences
 on
 the
 mount
 prohibited
 them
 from
 informing
 even
 their
 fellows
 of
 the
 Twelve
 Later
 after
 the
 Lord
 had
 ascended
 to
 His
 glory
 Peter
 testified
 to
 the
 Church
 of
 the
 wondrous
 experience
 in
 this
 forceful
 way
 For
 we
 have
 not
 followed
 cunningly
 devised
 fables
 when
 we
 made
 known
 unto
 you
 the
 power
 and
 coming
 of
 our
 Lord
 Jesus
 Christ
 but
 were
 eyewitnesses
 of
 his
 majesty
 For
 he
 received
 from
 God
 the
 Father
 honour
 and
 glory
 when
 there
 came
 such
 a
 voice
 to
 him
 from
 the
 excellent
 glory
 This
 is
 my
 beloved
 Son
 in
 whom
 I
 am
 well
 pleased
 And
 this
 voice
 which
 came
 from
 heaven
 we
 heard
 when
 we
 were
 with
 him
 in
 the
 holy
 mount
 And
 John
 reverently
 confessing
 before
 the
 world
 the
 divinity
 of
 the
 Word
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 who
 had
 been
 made
 flesh
 to
 dwell
 among
 men
 solemnly
 affirmed
 And
 we
 beheld
 his
 glory
 the
 glory
 as
 of
 the
 only
 begotten
 of
 the
 Father
 full
 of
 grace
 and
 truth
 The
 divine
 purpose
 as
 shown
 forth
 in
 the
 Transfiguration
 may
 be
 as
 incomprehensible
 to
 the
 human
 mind
 as
 is
 a
 full
 conception
 of
 the
 attendant
 splendor
 from
 verbal
 description
 some
 features
 of
 the
 results
 achieved
 are
 apparent
 however
 Unto
 Christ
 the
 manifestation
 was
 strengthening
 and
 encouraging
 The
 prospect
 of
 the
 experiences
 immediately
 ahead
 must
 naturally
 have
 been
 depressing
 and
 disheartening
 in
 the
 extreme
 In
 faithfully
 treading
 the
 path
 of
 His
 lifes
 work
 He
 had
 reached
 the
 verge
 of
 the
 valley
 of
 the
 shadow
 of
 death
 and
 the
 human
 part
 of
 His
 nature
 called
 for
 refreshing
 As
 angels
 had
 been
 sent
 to
 minister
 unto
 Him
 after
 the
 trying
 scenes
 of
 the
 forty
 days
 fast
 and
 the
 direct
 temptation
 of
 Satan
 and
 as
 in
 the
 agonizing
 hour
 of
 His
 bloody
 sweat
 He
 was
 to
 be
 sustained
 anew
 by
 angelic
 ministry
 so
 at
 this
 critical
 and
 crucial
 period
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 end
 visitants
 from
 the
 unseen
 world
 came
 to
 comfort
 and
 support
 Him
 What
 of
 actual
 communication
 passed
 in
 the
 conference
 of
 Jesus
 with
 Moses
 and
 Elijah
 is
 not
 of
 full
 record
 in
 the
 New
 Testament
 Gospels
 The
 voice
 of
 His
 Father
 to
 whom
 He
 was
 the
 Firstborn
 in
 the
 spiritworld
 and
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 in
 the
 flesh
 was
 of
 supreme
 assurance
 yet
 that
 voice
 had
 been
 addressed
 to
 the
 three
 apostles
 rather
 than
 to
 Jesus
 who
 had
 already
 received
 the
 Fathers
 acknowledgment
 and
 attestation
 on
 the
 occasion
 of
 His
 baptism
 The
 fullest
 version
 of
 the
 Fathers
 words
 to
 Peter
 James
 and
 John
 is
 that
 recorded
 by
 Matthew
 This
 is
 my
 beloved
 Son
 in
 whom
 I
 am
 well
 pleased
 hear
 ye
 him
 Aside
 from
 the
 proclamation
 of
 the
 Sons
 divine
 nature
 the
 Fathers
 words
 were
 otherwise
 decisive
 and
 portentous
 Moses
 the
 promulgator
 of
 the
 law
 and
 Elijah
 the
 representative
 of
 the
 prophets
 and
 especially
 distinguished
 among
 them
 as
 the
 one
 who
 had
 not
 died
 had
 been
 seen
 ministering
 unto
 Jesus
 and
 subservient
 to
 Him
 The
 fulfillment
 of
 the
 law
 and
 the
 superseding
 of
 the
 prophets
 by
 the
 Messiah
 was
 attested
 in
 the
 commandHear
 ye
 Him
 A
 new
 dispensation
 had
 been
 established
 that
 of
 the
 gospel
 for
 which
 the
 law
 and
 the
 prophets
 had
 been
 but
 preparatory
 The
 apostles
 were
 to
 be
 guided
 neither
 by
 Moses
 nor
 Elijah
 but
 by
 Him
 their
 Lord
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 The
 three
 selected
 apostles
 the
 Man
 of
 Rock
 and
 the
 Sons
 of
 Thunder
 had
 seen
 the
 Lord
 in
 glory
 and
 they
 marveled
 that
 such
 a
 thing
 could
 be
 at
 that
 time
 since
 as
 they
 had
 interpreted
 the
 scriptures
 it
 had
 been
 predicted
 that
 Elijah
 should
 precede
 the
 Messiahs
 triumphal
 advent
 As
 they
 wended
 their
 way
 down
 the
 mountainside
 they
 asked
 the
 Master
 Why
 then
 say
 the
 scribes
 that
 Elias
 must
 first
 come
 Jesus
 confirmed
 the
 prophecy
 that
 Elias
 should
 first
 come
 that
 is
 before
 the
 Lords
 advent
 in
 glory
 which
 event
 they
 had
 in
 mind
 But
 He
 added
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 Elias
 is
 come
 already
 and
 they
 knew
 him
 not
 but
 have
 done
 unto
 him
 whatsoever
 they
 listed
 Likewise
 shall
 also
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 suffer
 of
 them
 Then
 the
 disciples
 understood
 that
 he
 spake
 unto
 them
 of
 John
 the
 Baptist
 That
 John
 the
 Baptist
 would
 officiate
 in
 the
 spirit
 and
 power
 of
 Elias
 as
 the
 forerunner
 of
 the
 Christ
 had
 been
 announced
 by
 the
 angel
 Gabriel
 to
 Zacharias
 before
 the
 Baptists
 birth
 and
 that
 John
 was
 that
 particular
 Elias
 had
 been
 shown
 by
 Jesus
 in
 His
 memorable
 tribute
 to
 the
 Baptists
 fidelity
 and
 greatness
 That
 His
 words
 would
 not
 be
 generally
 accepted
 with
 understanding
 is
 evidenced
 by
 the
 context
 Jesus
 on
 that
 occasion
 had
 said
 And
 if
 ye
 will
 receive
 it
 this
 is
 Elias
 which
 was
 for
 to
 come
 It
 is
 not
 possible
 that
 Jesus
 could
 have
 meant
 that
 John
 was
 the
 same
 individual
 as
 Elijah
 nor
 could
 the
 people
 have
 so
 understood
 His
 words
 since
 the
 false
 doctrine
 of
 transmigration
 or
 reincarnation
 of
 spirits
 was
 repudiated
 by
 the
 Jews
 The
 seeming
 difficulty
 is
 removed
 when
 we
 consider
 that
 as
 the
 name
 appears
 in
 the
 New
 Testament
 Elias
 is
 used
 for
 Elijah
 with
 no
 attempt
 at
 distinction
 between
 Elijah
 the
 Tishbite
 and
 any
 other
 person
 known
 as
 Elias
 Gabriels
 declaration
 that
 the
 then
 unborn
 John
 should
 manifest
 the
 spirit
 and
 power
 of
 Elias
 indicates
 that
 Elias
 is
 a
 title
 of
 office
 every
 restorer
 forerunner
 or
 one
 sent
 of
 God
 to
 prepare
 the
 way
 for
 greater
 developments
 in
 the
 gospel
 plan
 is
 an
 Elias
 The
 appellative
 Elias
 is
 in
 fact
 both
 a
 personal
 name
 and
 a
 title
 In
 the
 present
 dispensation
 both
 the
 ancient
 Elias
 who
 belonged
 to
 the
 Abrahamic
 dispensation
 and
 in
 the
 spirit
 of
 whose
 office
 many
 have
 officiated
 in
 different
 periods
 and
 also
 the
 prophet
 Elijah
 have
 appeared
 in
 person
 and
 have
 conferred
 their
 particular
 and
 separate
 authority
 upon
 latterday
 bearers
 of
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 and
 the
 keys
 of
 the
 powers
 exercized
 by
 them
 while
 on
 earth
 are
 today
 inherent
 in
 the
 restored
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 The
 authority
 of
 Elias
 is
 inferior
 to
 that
 of
 Elijah
 the
 first
 being
 a
 function
 of
 the
 Lesser
 or
 Aaronic
 order
 of
 Priesthood
 while
 the
 latter
 belongs
 to
 the
 Higher
 or
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 Malachis
 prediction
 that
 before
 the
 great
 and
 dreadful
 day
 of
 the
 Lord
 Elijah
 the
 prophet
 would
 be
 sent
 to
 earth
 to
 turn
 the
 heart
 of
 the
 fathers
 to
 the
 children
 and
 the
 hearts
 of
 the
 children
 to
 their
 fathers
 did
 not
 reach
 fulfilment
 in
 the
 mission
 of
 John
 the
 Baptist
 nor
 in
 that
 of
 any
 other
 Elias
 its
 complete
 realization
 was
 inaugurated
 on
 the
 third
 day
 of
 April
 
 when
 Elijah
 appeared
 in
 the
 temple
 at
 Kirtland
 Ohio
 and
 committed
 to
 Joseph
 Smith
 and
 Oliver
 Cowdery
 the
 keys
 of
 the
 authority
 theretofore
 vested
 in
 himself
 The
 great
 and
 dreadful
 day
 of
 the
 Lord
 was
 not
 the
 meridian
 of
 time
 that
 awful
 though
 blessed
 period
 of
 consummation
 is
 yet
 future
 but
 near
 even
 at
 the
 doors
 NOTES
 TO
 CHAPTER
 
 
 Interval
 Between
 Time
 of
 Peters
 Confession
 and
 that
 of
 the
 TransfigurationBoth
 Matthew
 
 and
 Mark
 
 state
 that
 the
 Transfiguration
 occurred
 after
 six
 days
 following
 the
 time
 of
 Peters
 great
 confession
 that
 Jesus
 was
 the
 Christ
 while
 Luke
 
 notes
 an
 interval
 of
 about
 an
 eight
 days
 It
 is
 probable
 that
 the
 sixday
 period
 was
 meant
 to
 be
 exclusive
 of
 the
 day
 on
 which
 the
 earlier
 events
 had
 occurred
 and
 of
 that
 on
 which
 Jesus
 and
 the
 three
 apostles
 retired
 to
 the
 mountain
 and
 that
 Lukes
 about
 an
 eight
 days
 was
 made
 to
 include
 these
 two
 days
 There
 is
 here
 no
 ground
 for
 a
 claim
 of
 discrepancy
 
 Peter
 James
 and
 John
 who
 were
 selected
 from
 among
 the
 Twelve
 as
 the
 only
 earthly
 witnesses
 of
 the
 transfiguration
 of
 Christ
 had
 been
 similarly
 chosen
 as
 witnesses
 of
 a
 special
 manifestation
 that
 of
 the
 raising
 of
 the
 daughter
 of
 Jairus
 Mark
 
 Luke
 
 and
 later
 the
 same
 three
 were
 the
 sole
 witnesses
 of
 our
 Lords
 night
 agony
 in
 Gethsemane
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 
 Place
 of
 the
 TransfigurationThe
 mountain
 on
 which
 the
 Transfiguration
 occurred
 is
 neither
 named
 nor
 otherwise
 indicated
 by
 the
 Gospelwriters
 in
 such
 a
 way
 as
 to
 admit
 of
 its
 positive
 identification
 Mount
 Tabor
 in
 Galilee
 has
 long
 been
 held
 by
 tradition
 as
 the
 site
 and
 in
 the
 sixth
 century
 three
 churches
 were
 erected
 on
 its
 plateaulike
 summit
 possibly
 in
 commemoration
 of
 Peters
 desire
 to
 make
 three
 tabernacles
 or
 booths
 one
 each
 for
 Jesus
 Moses
 and
 Elijah
 Later
 a
 monastery
 was
 built
 there
 Nevertheless
 Mt
 Tabor
 is
 now
 rejected
 by
 investigators
 and
 Mt
 Hermon
 is
 generally
 regarded
 as
 the
 place
 Hermon
 stands
 near
 the
 northerly
 limits
 of
 Palestine
 just
 beyond
 Csarea
 Philippi
 where
 Jesus
 is
 known
 to
 have
 been
 a
 week
 before
 the
 Transfiguration
 Mark
 
 distinctly
 tells
 us
 that
 after
 His
 descent
 from
 the
 mount
 Jesus
 and
 the
 apostles
 departed
 and
 went
 through
 Galilee
 Weight
 of
 evidence
 is
 in
 favor
 of
 Hermon
 as
 the
 Mount
 of
 Transfiguration
 though
 nothing
 that
 may
 be
 called
 decisive
 is
 known
 in
 the
 matter
 
 The
 Names
 Elias
 and
 ElijahThe
 following
 statement
 which
 appears
 in
 Smiths
 Bible
 Dictionary
 is
 supported
 by
 authorities
 in
 general
 Elias
 is
 the
 Greek
 and
 Latin
 form
 of
 Elijah
 given
 in
 the
 Authorized
 Version
 of
 the
 Apocrypha
 and
 New
 Testament
 
 The
 Spirit
 and
 Power
 of
 EliasThat
 John
 the
 Baptist
 in
 his
 capacity
 as
 a
 restorer
 a
 forerunner
 or
 as
 one
 sent
 to
 prepare
 the
 way
 for
 a
 work
 greater
 than
 his
 own
 did
 officiate
 as
 an
 Elias
 is
 attested
 by
 both
 ancient
 and
 latterday
 scripture
 Through
 him
 water
 baptism
 for
 the
 remission
 of
 sins
 was
 preached
 and
 administered
 and
 the
 higher
 baptism
 that
 of
 the
 Spirit
 was
 made
 possible
 True
 to
 his
 mission
 he
 has
 come
 in
 the
 last
 dispensation
 and
 has
 restored
 by
 ordination
 the
 Priesthood
 of
 Aaron
 which
 has
 authority
 to
 baptize
 He
 thus
 prepared
 the
 way
 for
 the
 vicarious
 labor
 of
 baptism
 for
 the
 dead
 the
 authority
 for
 which
 was
 restored
 by
 Elijah
 see
 page
 
 herein
 and
 which
 is
 preeminently
 the
 work
 by
 which
 the
 children
 and
 the
 fathers
 shall
 be
 united
 in
 an
 eternal
 bond
 On
 the
 th
 of
 March
 
 the
 Prophet
 Joseph
 Smith
 gave
 the
 following
 exposition
 of
 the
 power
 of
 Elias
 as
 compared
 with
 higher
 authority
 The
 spirit
 of
 Elias
 is
 first
 Elijah
 second
 and
 Messiah
 last
 Elias
 is
 a
 forerunner
 to
 prepare
 the
 way
 and
 the
 spirit
 and
 power
 of
 Elijah
 is
 to
 come
 after
 holding
 the
 keys
 of
 power
 building
 the
 temple
 to
 the
 capstone
 placing
 the
 seals
 of
 the
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 upon
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 and
 making
 all
 things
 ready
 then
 Messiah
 comes
 to
 His
 temple
 which
 is
 last
 of
 all
 Messiah
 is
 above
 the
 spirit
 and
 power
 of
 Elijah
 for
 He
 made
 the
 world
 and
 was
 that
 spiritual
 rock
 unto
 Moses
 in
 the

 Mention
 of
 the
 Lords
 Approaching
 DeceaseOf
 the
 three
 synoptists
 Luke
 alone
 makes
 even
 brief
 mention
 of
 the
 matter
 upon
 which
 Moses
 and
 Elijah
 conversed
 with
 the
 Lord
 at
 the
 Transfiguration
 The
 record
 states
 that
 the
 visitants
 who
 appeared
 in
 glory
 spake
 of
 his
 decease
 which
 he
 should
 accomplish
 at
 Jerusalem
 Luke
 
 It
 is
 significant
 that
 the
 decease
 which
 the
 Lord
 should
 accomplish
 not
 the
 death
 that
 He
 should
 suffer
 or
 die
 was
 the
 subject
 of
 that
 exalted
 communion
 The
 Greek
 word
 of
 which
 decease
 appears
 as
 the
 English
 equivalent
 in
 many
 of
 the
 MSS
 of
 the
 Gospels
 is
 one
 connoting
 exodus
 or
 departure
 and
 the
 word
 occurring
 in
 other
 early
 versions
 signifies
 glory
 So
 also
 the
 Greek
 original
 of
 accomplish
 in
 the
 account
 of
 the
 Transfiguration
 connotes
 the
 successful
 filling
 out
 or
 completion
 of
 a
 specific
 undertaking
 and
 not
 distinctively
 the
 act
 of
 dying
 Both
 the
 letter
 of
 the
 record
 and
 the
 spirit
 in
 which
 the
 recorder
 wrote
 indicate
 that
 Moses
 and
 Elijah
 conversed
 with
 their
 Lord
 on
 the
 glorious
 consummation
 of
 His
 mission
 in
 mortalitya
 consummation
 recognized
 in
 the
 law
 personified
 in
 Moses
 and
 the
 prophets
 represented
 by
 Elijahand
 an
 event
 of
 supreme
 import
 determining
 the
 fulfilment
 of
 both
 the
 law
 and
 the
 prophets
 and
 the
 glorious
 inauguration
 of
 a
 new
 and
 higher
 order
 as
 part
 of
 the
 divine
 plan
 The
 decease
 that
 the
 Savior
 was
 then
 so
 soon
 to
 accomplish
 was
 the
 voluntary
 surrender
 of
 His
 life
 in
 fulfilment
 of
 a
 purpose
 at
 once
 exalted
 and
 foreordained
 not
 a
 death
 by
 which
 He
 would
 passively
 die
 through
 conditions
 beyond
 His
 control

 CHAPTER
 
 FROM
 SUNSHINE
 TO
 SHADOW
 Our
 Lords
 descent
 from
 the
 holy
 heights
 of
 the
 Mount
 of
 Transfiguration
 was
 more
 than
 a
 physical
 return
 from
 greater
 to
 lesser
 altitudes
 it
 was
 a
 passing
 from
 sunshine
 into
 shadow
 from
 the
 effulgent
 glory
 of
 heaven
 to
 the
 mists
 of
 worldly
 passions
 and
 human
 unbelief
 it
 was
 the
 beginning
 of
 His
 rapid
 descent
 into
 the
 valley
 of
 humiliation
 From
 lofty
 converse
 with
 divinelyappointed
 ministers
 from
 supreme
 communion
 with
 His
 Father
 and
 God
 Jesus
 came
 down
 to
 a
 scene
 of
 disheartening
 confusion
 and
 a
 spectacle
 of
 demonized
 dominion
 before
 which
 even
 His
 apostles
 stood
 in
 impotent
 despair
 To
 His
 sensitive
 and
 sinless
 soul
 the
 contrast
 must
 have
 brought
 superhuman
 anguish
 even
 to
 us
 who
 read
 the
 brief
 account
 thereof
 it
 is
 appalling
 HEALING
 OF
 YOUTHFUL
 DEMONIAC
 Jesus
 and
 the
 three
 apostles
 returned
 from
 the
 mount
 on
 the
 morrow
 following
 the
 Transfiguration
 this
 fact
 suggests
 the
 assumption
 that
 the
 glorious
 manifestation
 had
 occurred
 during
 the
 night
 At
 or
 near
 the
 base
 of
 the
 mountain
 the
 party
 found
 the
 other
 apostles
 and
 with
 them
 a
 multitude
 of
 people
 including
 some
 scribes
 or
 rabbis
 There
 was
 evidence
 of
 disputation
 and
 disturbance
 amongst
 the
 crowd
 and
 plainly
 the
 apostles
 were
 on
 the
 defensive
 At
 the
 unexpected
 approach
 of
 Jesus
 many
 of
 the
 people
 ran
 to
 meet
 Him
 with
 respectful
 salutations
 Of
 the
 contentious
 scribes
 He
 asked
 What
 question
 ye
 with
 them
 thus
 assuming
 the
 burden
 of
 the
 dispute
 whatever
 it
 might
 be
 and
 so
 relieving
 the
 distressed
 disciples
 from
 further
 active
 participation
 The
 scribes
 remained
 silent
 their
 courage
 had
 vanished
 when
 the
 Master
 appeared
 A
 man
 one
 of
 the
 multitude
 gave
 though
 indirectly
 the
 answer
 Master
 said
 he
 kneeling
 at
 the
 feet
 of
 Christ
 I
 have
 brought
 unto
 thee
 my
 son
 which
 hath
 a
 dumb
 spirit
 and
 wheresoever
 he
 taketh
 him
 he
 teareth
 him
 and
 he
 foameth
 and
 gnasheth
 with
 his
 teeth
 and
 pineth
 away
 and
 I
 spake
 to
 thy
 disciples
 that
 they
 should
 cast
 him
 out
 and
 they
 could
 not
 The
 disciples
 failure
 to
 heal
 the
 stricken
 youth
 had
 evidently
 brought
 upon
 them
 hostile
 criticism
 taunts
 and
 ridicule
 from
 the
 unbelieving
 scribes
 and
 their
 discomfiture
 must
 have
 been
 intensified
 by
 the
 thought
 that
 through
 them
 doubt
 had
 been
 cast
 upon
 the
 authority
 and
 power
 of
 their
 Lord
 Pained
 in
 spirit
 at
 thisanother
 instance
 of
 dearth
 of
 faith
 and
 consequent
 lack
 of
 power
 among
 His
 chosen
 and
 ordained
 servantsJesus
 uttered
 an
 exclamation
 of
 intense
 sorrow
 O
 faithless
 generation
 how
 long
 shall
 I
 be
 with
 you
 how
 long
 shall
 I
 suffer
 you
 These
 words
 in
 which
 there
 is
 evident
 reproof
 however
 mild
 and
 pitying
 it
 may
 be
 were
 addressed
 primarily
 to
 the
 apostles
 whether
 exclusively
 so
 or
 to
 them
 and
 others
 is
 of
 minor
 importance
 As
 Jesus
 directed
 the
 afflicted
 lad
 was
 brought
 nearer
 and
 the
 tormenting
 demon
 finding
 himself
 in
 the
 Masters
 presence
 threw
 his
 youthful
 victim
 into
 a
 terrible
 paroxysm
 so
 that
 the
 boy
 fell
 to
 the
 ground
 and
 wallowed
 in
 convulsions
 the
 while
 frothing
 and
 foaming
 at
 the
 mouth
 With
 calm
 deliberation
 which
 contrasted
 strongly
 with
 the
 eager
 impatience
 of
 the
 distracted
 parent
 Jesus
 inquired
 as
 to
 when
 the
 malady
 had
 first
 befallen
 the
 lad
 Of
 a
 child
 answered
 the
 father
 adding
 And
 ofttimes
 it
 hath
 cast
 him
 into
 the
 fire
 and
 into
 the
 waters
 to
 destroy
 him
 With
 pathetic
 eagerness
 he
 implored
 If
 thou
 canst
 do
 anything
 have
 compassion
 on
 us
 and
 help
 us
 The
 man
 spoke
 of
 his
 sons
 affliction
 as
 though
 shared
 by
 himself
 Help
 us
 was
 his
 prayer
 To
 this
 qualifying
 expression
 If
 thou
 canst
 do
 anything
 which
 implied
 a
 measure
 of
 uncertainty
 as
 to
 the
 ability
 of
 the
 Master
 to
 grant
 what
 he
 asked
 and
 this
 perhaps
 as
 in
 part
 a
 result
 of
 the
 failure
 of
 the
 apostles
 Jesus
 replied
 If
 thou
 canst
 believe
 and
 added
 all
 things
 are
 possible
 to
 him
 that
 believeth
 The
 mans
 understanding
 was
 enlightened
 up
 to
 that
 moment
 he
 had
 thought
 that
 all
 depended
 upon
 Jesus
 he
 now
 saw
 that
 the
 issue
 rested
 largely
 with
 himself
 It
 is
 noteworthy
 that
 the
 Lord
 specified
 belief
 rather
 than
 faith
 as
 the
 condition
 essential
 to
 the
 case
 The
 man
 was
 evidently
 trustful
 and
 assuredly
 fervent
 in
 his
 hope
 that
 Jesus
 could
 help
 but
 it
 is
 doubtful
 that
 he
 knew
 what
 faith
 really
 meant
 He
 was
 receptive
 and
 eagerly
 teachable
 however
 and
 the
 Lord
 strengthened
 his
 feeble
 and
 uncertain
 belief
 The
 encouraging
 explanation
 of
 the
 real
 need
 stimulated
 him
 to
 a
 more
 abounding
 trust
 Weeping
 in
 an
 agony
 of
 hope
 he
 cried
 out
 Lord
 I
 believe
 and
 then
 realizing
 the
 darkness
 of
 error
 from
 which
 he
 was
 just
 beginning
 to
 emerge
 he
 added
 penitently
 help
 thou
 mine
 unbelief
 
 Looking
 compassionately
 upon
 the
 writhing
 sufferer
 at
 His
 feet
 Jesus
 rebuked
 the
 demon
 thus
 Thou
 dumb
 and
 deaf
 spirit
 I
 charge
 thee
 come
 out
 of
 him
 and
 enter
 no
 more
 into
 him
 And
 the
 spirit
 cried
 and
 rent
 him
 sore
 and
 came
 out
 of
 him
 and
 he
 was
 as
 one
 dead
 insomuch
 that
 many
 said
 He
 is
 dead
 But
 Jesus
 took
 him
 by
 the
 hand
 and
 lifted
 him
 up
 and
 he
 arose
 and
 as
 Luke
 adds
 and
 delivered
 him
 again
 to
 his
 father
 The
 permanency
 of
 the
 cure
 was
 assured
 by
 the
 express
 command
 that
 the
 evil
 spirit
 enter
 no
 more
 into
 the
 lad
 it
 was
 no
 relief
 from
 that
 present
 attack
 alone
 the
 healing
 was
 permanent
 The
 people
 were
 amazed
 at
 the
 power
 of
 God
 manifested
 in
 the
 miracle
 and
 the
 apostles
 who
 had
 tried
 and
 failed
 to
 subdue
 the
 evil
 spirit
 were
 disturbed
 While
 on
 their
 mission
 though
 away
 from
 their
 Masters
 helpful
 presence
 they
 had
 successfully
 rebuked
 and
 cast
 out
 evil
 spirits
 as
 they
 had
 received
 special
 power
 and
 commission
 to
 do
 but
 now
 during
 His
 absence
 of
 a
 day
 they
 had
 found
 themselves
 unable
 When
 they
 had
 retired
 to
 the
 house
 they
 asked
 of
 Jesus
 Why
 could
 not
 we
 cast
 him
 out
 The
 reply
 was
 Because
 of
 your
 unbelief
 and
 in
 further
 explanation
 the
 Lord
 said
 Howbeit
 this
 kind
 goeth
 not
 out
 but
 by
 prayer
 and
 fasting
 Hereby
 we
 learn
 that
 the
 achievements
 possible
 to
 faith
 are
 limited
 or
 conditioned
 by
 the
 genuineness
 the
 purity
 the
 unmixed
 quality
 of
 that
 faith
 O
 ye
 of
 little
 faith
 Where
 is
 your
 faith
 and
 Wherefore
 didst
 thou
 doubt
 are
 forms
 of
 admonitory
 reproof
 that
 had
 been
 repeatedly
 addressed
 to
 the
 apostles
 by
 the
 Lord
 The
 possibilities
 of
 faith
 were
 now
 thus
 further
 affirmed
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 If
 ye
 have
 faith
 as
 a
 grain
 of
 mustard
 seed
 ye
 shall
 say
 unto
 this
 mountain
 Remove
 hence
 to
 yonder
 place
 and
 it
 shall
 remove
 and
 nothing
 shall
 be
 impossible
 unto
 you
 The
 comparison
 between
 effective
 faith
 and
 a
 grain
 of
 mustard
 seed
 is
 one
 of
 quality
 rather
 than
 of
 quantity
 it
 connotes
 living
 virile
 faith
 like
 unto
 the
 seed
 however
 small
 from
 which
 a
 great
 plant
 may
 spring
 in
 contrast
 with
 a
 lifeless
 artificial
 imitation
 however
 prominent
 or
 demonstrative
 THE
 LORDS
 DEATH
 AND
 RESURRECTION
 AGAIN
 PREDICTED
 From
 the
 locality
 whereat
 the
 last
 miracle
 was
 wrought
 Jesus
 departed
 with
 the
 Twelve
 and
 passed
 through
 Galilee
 toward
 Capernaum
 It
 is
 probable
 that
 they
 traveled
 by
 the
 less
 frequented
 roads
 as
 He
 desired
 that
 His
 return
 should
 not
 be
 publicly
 known
 He
 had
 gone
 into
 comparative
 retirement
 for
 a
 season
 primarily
 it
 seems
 in
 quest
 of
 opportunity
 to
 more
 thoroughly
 instruct
 the
 apostles
 in
 their
 preparation
 for
 the
 work
 which
 within
 a
 few
 months
 they
 would
 be
 left
 to
 carry
 on
 without
 His
 bodily
 companionship
 They
 had
 solemnly
 testified
 that
 they
 knew
 Him
 to
 be
 the
 Christ
 to
 them
 therefore
 He
 could
 impart
 much
 that
 the
 people
 in
 general
 were
 wholly
 unprepared
 to
 receive
 The
 particular
 theme
 of
 His
 special
 and
 advanced
 instruction
 to
 the
 Twelve
 was
 that
 of
 His
 approaching
 death
 and
 resurrection
 and
 this
 was
 dwelt
 upon
 again
 and
 again
 for
 they
 were
 slow
 or
 unwilling
 to
 comprehend
 Let
 these
 sayings
 sink
 down
 into
 your
 ears
 was
 His
 forceful
 prelude
 on
 this
 occasion
 in
 Galilee
 Then
 followed
 the
 reiterated
 prediction
 spoken
 in
 part
 in
 the
 present
 tense
 as
 though
 already
 begun
 in
 fulfilment
 The
 Son
 of
 man
 is
 delivered
 into
 the
 hands
 of
 men
 and
 they
 shall
 kill
 him
 and
 after
 that
 he
 is
 killed
 he
 shall
 rise
 the
 third
 day
 We
 read
 with
 some
 surprize
 that
 the
 apostles
 still
 failed
 to
 understand
 Lukes
 comment
 is
 But
 they
 understood
 not
 this
 saying
 and
 it
 was
 hid
 from
 them
 that
 they
 perceived
 it
 not
 and
 they
 feared
 to
 ask
 him
 of
 that
 saying
 The
 thought
 of
 what
 the
 Lords
 words
 might
 mean
 even
 in
 its
 faintest
 outline
 was
 terrifying
 to
 those
 devoted
 men
 and
 their
 failure
 to
 comprehend
 was
 in
 part
 due
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 human
 mind
 is
 loath
 to
 search
 deeply
 into
 anything
 it
 desires
 not
 to
 believe
 THE
 TRIBUTE
 MONEYSUPPLIED
 BY
 A
 MIRACLE
 Jesus
 and
 His
 followers
 were
 again
 in
 Capernaum
 There
 Peter
 was
 approached
 by
 a
 collector
 of
 the
 temple
 tax
 who
 asked
 Doth
 not
 your
 Master
 pay
 tribute
 Peter
 answered
 Yes
 It
 is
 interesting
 to
 find
 that
 the
 inquiry
 was
 made
 of
 Peter
 and
 not
 directly
 of
 Jesus
 this
 circumstance
 may
 be
 indicative
 of
 the
 respect
 in
 which
 the
 Lord
 was
 held
 by
 the
 people
 at
 large
 and
 may
 suggest
 the
 possibility
 of
 doubt
 in
 the
 collectors
 mind
 as
 to
 whether
 Jesus
 was
 amenable
 to
 the
 tax
 since
 priests
 and
 rabbis
 generally
 claimed
 exemption
 The
 annual
 capitation
 tax
 here
 referred
 to
 amounted
 to
 half
 a
 shekel
 or
 a
 didrachm
 corresponding
 to
 about
 thirtythree
 cents
 in
 our
 money
 and
 this
 had
 been
 required
 of
 every
 male
 adult
 in
 Israel
 since
 the
 days
 of
 the
 exodus
 though
 during
 the
 period
 of
 captivity
 the
 requirement
 had
 been
 modified
 This
 tribute
 as
 prescribed
 through
 Moses
 was
 originally
 known
 as
 atonement
 money
 and
 its
 payment
 was
 in
 the
 nature
 of
 a
 sacrifice
 to
 accompany
 supplication
 for
 ransom
 from
 the
 effects
 of
 individual
 sin
 At
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 the
 annual
 contribution
 was
 usually
 collected
 between
 early
 March
 and
 the
 Passover
 If
 Jesus
 was
 subject
 to
 this
 tax
 He
 was
 at
 this
 time
 several
 weeks
 in
 arrears
 The
 conversation
 between
 Peter
 and
 the
 taxcollector
 had
 occurred
 outside
 the
 house
 When
 Peter
 entered
 and
 was
 about
 to
 inform
 the
 Master
 concerning
 the
 interview
 Jesus
 forestalled
 him
 saying
 What
 thinkest
 thou
 Simon
 of
 whom
 do
 the
 kings
 of
 the
 earth
 take
 custom
 or
 tribute
 of
 their
 own
 children
 or
 of
 strangers
 Peter
 saith
 unto
 him
 Of
 strangers
 Jesus
 saith
 unto
 him
 Then
 are
 the
 children
 free
 Peter
 must
 have
 seen
 the
 inconsistency
 of
 expecting
 Jesus
 the
 acknowledged
 Messiah
 to
 pay
 atonement
 money
 or
 a
 tax
 for
 temple
 maintenance
 inasmuch
 as
 the
 temple
 was
 the
 House
 of
 God
 and
 Jesus
 was
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 and
 particularly
 since
 even
 earthly
 princes
 were
 exempted
 from
 capitation
 dues
 Peters
 embarrassment
 over
 his
 inconsiderate
 boldness
 in
 pledging
 payment
 for
 his
 Master
 without
 first
 consulting
 Him
 was
 relieved
 however
 by
 Jesus
 who
 said
 Notwithstanding
 lest
 we
 should
 offend
 them
 go
 thou
 to
 the
 sea
 and
 cast
 an
 hook
 and
 take
 up
 the
 fish
 that
 first
 cometh
 up
 and
 when
 thou
 hast
 opened
 his
 mouth
 thou
 shalt
 find
 a
 piece
 of
 money
 that
 take
 and
 give
 unto
 them
 for
 me
 and
 thee
 The
 money
 was
 to
 be
 paid
 not
 because
 it
 could
 be
 rightfully
 demanded
 of
 Jesus
 but
 lest
 nonpayment
 give
 offense
 and
 furnish
 to
 His
 opponents
 further
 excuse
 for
 complaint
 The
 piece
 of
 money
 which
 Jesus
 said
 Peter
 would
 find
 in
 the
 mouth
 of
 the
 first
 fish
 that
 took
 his
 bait
 is
 more
 correctly
 designated
 by
 the
 literal
 translation
 stater
 indicating
 a
 silver
 coin
 equivalent
 to
 a
 shekel
 or
 two
 didrachms
 and
 therefore
 the
 exact
 amount
 of
 the
 tax
 for
 two
 persons
 That
 take
 and
 give
 unto
 them
 for
 me
 and
 thee
 said
 Jesus
 It
 is
 notable
 that
 He
 did
 not
 say
 for
 us
 In
 His
 associations
 with
 men
 even
 with
 the
 Twelve
 who
 of
 all
 were
 nearest
 and
 dearest
 to
 Him
 our
 Lord
 always
 maintained
 His
 separate
 and
 unique
 status
 in
 every
 instance
 making
 the
 fact
 apparent
 that
 He
 was
 essentially
 different
 from
 other
 men
 This
 is
 illustrated
 by
 His
 expressions
 My
 Father
 and
 your
 Father
 My
 God
 and
 your
 God
 instead
 of
 our
 Father
 and
 our
 God
 He
 reverently
 acknowledged
 that
 He
 was
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 in
 a
 literal
 sense
 that
 did
 not
 apply
 to
 any
 other
 being
 While
 the
 circumstances
 of
 the
 finding
 of
 the
 stater
 in
 the
 fish
 are
 not
 detailed
 and
 the
 actual
 accomplishment
 of
 the
 miracle
 is
 not
 positively
 recorded
 we
 cannot
 doubt
 that
 what
 Jesus
 had
 promised
 was
 realized
 as
 otherwise
 there
 would
 appear
 no
 reason
 for
 introducing
 the
 incident
 into
 the
 Gospel
 narrative
 The
 miracle
 is
 without
 a
 parallel
 or
 even
 a
 remotely
 analogous
 instance
 We
 need
 not
 assume
 that
 the
 stater
 was
 other
 than
 an
 ordinary
 coin
 that
 had
 fallen
 into
 the
 water
 nor
 that
 it
 had
 been
 taken
 by
 the
 fish
 in
 any
 unusual
 way
 Nevertheless
 the
 knowledge
 that
 there
 was
 in
 the
 lake
 a
 fish
 having
 a
 coin
 in
 its
 gullet
 that
 the
 coin
 was
 of
 the
 denomination
 specified
 and
 that
 that
 particular
 fish
 would
 rise
 and
 be
 the
 first
 to
 rise
 to
 Peters
 hook
 is
 as
 incomprehensible
 to
 mans
 finite
 understanding
 as
 are
 the
 means
 by
 which
 any
 of
 Christs
 miracles
 were
 wrought
 The
 Lord
 Jesus
 held
 and
 holds
 dominion
 over
 the
 earth
 the
 sea
 and
 all
 that
 in
 them
 is
 for
 by
 His
 word
 and
 power
 were
 they
 made
 The
 Lords
 purpose
 in
 so
 miraculously
 supplying
 the
 money
 should
 be
 studiously
 considered
 The
 assumption
 that
 superhuman
 power
 had
 to
 be
 invoked
 because
 of
 a
 supposed
 condition
 of
 extreme
 poverty
 on
 the
 part
 of
 Jesus
 and
 Peter
 is
 unwarranted
 Even
 if
 Jesus
 and
 His
 companions
 had
 been
 actually
 penniless
 Peter
 and
 his
 fellow
 fishermen
 could
 easily
 have
 cast
 their
 net
 and
 with
 ordinary
 success
 have
 obtained
 fish
 enough
 to
 sell
 for
 the
 needed
 amount
 Moreover
 we
 find
 no
 instance
 of
 a
 miracle
 wrought
 by
 the
 Lord
 for
 personal
 gain
 or
 relief
 of
 His
 own
 need
 however
 pressing
 It
 appears
 probable
 that
 by
 the
 means
 employed
 for
 obtaining
 the
 money
 Jesus
 intentionally
 emphasized
 His
 exceptional
 reasons
 for
 redeeming
 Peters
 pledge
 that
 the
 tax
 would
 be
 paid
 The
 Jews
 who
 did
 not
 know
 Jesus
 as
 the
 Messiah
 but
 only
 as
 a
 Teacher
 of
 superior
 ability
 and
 a
 Man
 of
 unusual
 power
 might
 have
 taken
 offense
 had
 He
 refused
 to
 pay
 the
 tribute
 required
 of
 every
 Jew
 On
 the
 other
 hand
 to
 the
 apostles
 and
 particularly
 to
 Peter
 who
 had
 been
 the
 mouthpiece
 of
 all
 in
 the
 great
 confession
 the
 payment
 of
 the
 tax
 in
 ordinary
 course
 and
 without
 explanation
 by
 Jesus
 might
 have
 appeared
 as
 an
 admission
 that
 He
 was
 subject
 to
 the
 temple
 and
 therefore
 less
 than
 He
 had
 claimed
 and
 less
 than
 they
 had
 confessed
 Him
 to
 be
 His
 catechization
 of
 Peter
 had
 clearly
 demonstrated
 that
 He
 maintained
 His
 right
 as
 the
 Kings
 Son
 and
 yet
 would
 condescend
 to
 voluntarily
 give
 what
 could
 not
 be
 righteously
 demanded
 Then
 in
 conclusive
 demonstration
 of
 His
 exalted
 status
 He
 provided
 the
 money
 by
 the
 utilization
 of
 knowledge
 such
 as
 no
 other
 man
 possessed
 AS
 A
 LITTLE
 CHILD
 On
 the
 way
 to
 Capernaum
 the
 apostles
 had
 questioned
 among
 themselves
 as
 they
 supposed
 beyond
 the
 Masters
 hearing
 questioning
 had
 led
 to
 argument
 and
 argument
 to
 disputation
 The
 matter
 about
 which
 they
 were
 so
 greatly
 concerned
 was
 as
 to
 who
 among
 them
 should
 be
 the
 greatest
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 The
 testimony
 they
 had
 received
 convinced
 them
 beyond
 all
 doubt
 that
 Jesus
 was
 the
 longawaited
 Christ
 and
 this
 had
 been
 supplemented
 and
 confirmed
 by
 His
 unqualified
 acknowledgment
 of
 His
 Messianic
 dignity
 With
 minds
 still
 tinctured
 by
 the
 traditional
 expectation
 of
 the
 Messiah
 as
 both
 spiritual
 Lord
 and
 temporal
 King
 and
 remembering
 some
 of
 the
 Masters
 frequent
 references
 to
 His
 kingdom
 and
 the
 blessed
 state
 of
 those
 who
 belonged
 thereto
 and
 furthermore
 realizing
 that
 His
 recent
 utterances
 indicated
 a
 near
 crisis
 or
 climax
 in
 His
 ministry
 they
 surrendered
 themselves
 to
 the
 selfish
 contemplation
 of
 their
 prospective
 stations
 in
 the
 new
 kingdom
 and
 the
 particular
 offices
 of
 trust
 honor
 and
 emolument
 each
 most
 desired
 Who
 of
 them
 was
 to
 be
 prime
 minister
 who
 would
 be
 chancellor
 who
 the
 commander
 of
 the
 troops
 Personal
 ambition
 had
 already
 engendered
 jealousy
 in
 their
 hearts
 When
 they
 were
 together
 with
 Jesus
 in
 the
 house
 at
 Capernaum
 the
 subject
 was
 brought
 up
 again
 Mark
 tells
 us
 that
 Jesus
 asked
 What
 was
 it
 that
 ye
 disputed
 among
 yourselves
 by
 the
 way
 and
 that
 they
 answered
 not
 because
 as
 may
 be
 inferred
 they
 were
 ashamed
 From
 Matthews
 record
 it
 may
 be
 understood
 that
 the
 apostles
 submitted
 the
 question
 for
 the
 Masters
 decision
 The
 apparent
 difference
 of
 circumstance
 is
 unimportant
 both
 accounts
 are
 correct
 Christs
 question
 to
 them
 may
 have
 eventually
 brought
 out
 their
 questions
 to
 Him
 Jesus
 comprehending
 their
 thoughts
 and
 knowing
 their
 unenlightened
 state
 of
 mind
 on
 the
 matter
 that
 troubled
 them
 gave
 them
 an
 illustrated
 lesson
 Calling
 a
 little
 child
 whom
 He
 lovingly
 took
 into
 His
 arm
 He
 said
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Except
 ye
 be
 converted
 and
 become
 as
 little
 children
 ye
 shall
 not
 enter
 into
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 Whosoever
 therefore
 shall
 humble
 himself
 as
 this
 little
 child
 the
 same
 is
 greatest
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 And
 whoso
 shall
 receive
 one
 such
 little
 child
 in
 my
 name
 receiveth
 me
 But
 whoso
 shall
 offend
 one
 of
 these
 little
 ones
 which
 believe
 in
 me
 it
 were
 better
 for
 him
 that
 a
 millstone
 were
 hanged
 about
 his
 neck
 and
 that
 he
 were
 drowned
 in
 the
 depth
 of
 the
 sea
 With
 this
 lesson
 we
 may
 profitably
 associate
 a
 later
 teaching
 that
 little
 children
 are
 typical
 of
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 Even
 the
 apostles
 were
 in
 need
 of
 conversion
 respecting
 the
 matter
 at
 issue
 their
 hearts
 were
 turned
 partly
 at
 least
 from
 God
 and
 His
 kingdom
 They
 had
 to
 learn
 that
 genuine
 humility
 is
 an
 attribute
 essential
 to
 citizenship
 in
 the
 community
 of
 the
 blessed
 and
 that
 the
 degree
 of
 humility
 conditions
 whatsoever
 there
 is
 akin
 to
 rank
 in
 the
 kingdom
 for
 therein
 the
 humblest
 shall
 be
 greatest
 Christ
 would
 not
 have
 had
 His
 chosen
 representatives
 become
 childish
 far
 from
 it
 they
 had
 to
 be
 men
 of
 courage
 fortitude
 and
 force
 but
 He
 would
 have
 them
 become
 childlike
 The
 distinction
 is
 important
 Those
 who
 belong
 to
 Christ
 must
 become
 like
 children
 in
 obedience
 truthfulness
 trustfulness
 purity
 humility
 and
 faith
 The
 child
 is
 an
 artless
 natural
 trusting
 believer
 the
 childish
 one
 is
 careless
 foolish
 and
 neglectful
 In
 contrasting
 these
 characteristics
 note
 the
 counsel
 of
 Paul
 Brethren
 be
 not
 children
 in
 understanding
 howbeit
 in
 malice
 be
 ye
 children
 but
 in
 understanding
 be
 men
 Children
 as
 such
 and
 children
 as
 types
 of
 adults
 who
 are
 true
 believers
 are
 closely
 associated
 in
 this
 lesson
 Whosoever
 shall
 offend
 that
 is
 cause
 to
 stumble
 or
 go
 astray
 one
 such
 child
 of
 Christ
 incurs
 guilt
 so
 great
 that
 it
 would
 have
 been
 better
 for
 him
 had
 he
 met
 death
 even
 by
 violence
 before
 he
 had
 so
 sinned
 Dwelling
 upon
 offenses
 or
 causes
 of
 stumbling
 the
 Lord
 continued
 Woe
 unto
 the
 world
 because
 of
 offences
 for
 it
 must
 needs
 be
 that
 offences
 come
 but
 woe
 to
 that
 man
 by
 whom
 the
 offence
 cometh
 Then
 repeating
 some
 of
 the
 precious
 truths
 embodied
 in
 His
 memorable
 Sermon
 on
 the
 Mount
 He
 urged
 the
 overcoming
 of
 evil
 propensities
 whatever
 the
 sacrifice
 As
 it
 is
 better
 that
 a
 man
 undergo
 surgical
 treatment
 though
 he
 lose
 thereby
 a
 hand
 a
 foot
 or
 an
 eye
 than
 that
 his
 whole
 body
 be
 involved
 and
 his
 life
 forfeited
 so
 is
 it
 commended
 that
 he
 cut
 off
 tear
 away
 or
 root
 out
 from
 his
 soul
 the
 passions
 of
 evil
 which
 if
 suffered
 to
 remain
 shall
 surely
 bring
 him
 under
 condemnation
 In
 that
 state
 his
 conscience
 shall
 gnaw
 as
 an
 undying
 worm
 and
 his
 remorse
 shall
 be
 as
 a
 fire
 that
 cannot
 be
 quenched
 Every
 human
 soul
 shall
 be
 tested
 as
 by
 fire
 and
 as
 the
 flesh
 of
 the
 altar
 sacrifices
 had
 to
 be
 seasoned
 with
 salt
 as
 a
 type
 of
 preservation
 from
 corruption
 so
 also
 the
 soul
 must
 receive
 the
 saving
 salt
 of
 the
 gospel
 and
 that
 salt
 must
 be
 pure
 and
 potent
 not
 a
 dirty
 mixture
 of
 inherited
 prejudice
 and
 unauthorized
 tradition
 that
 has
 lost
 whatever
 saltness
 it
 may
 once
 have
 had
 Have
 salt
 in
 yourselves
 and
 have
 peace
 one
 with
 another
 was
 the
 Lords
 admonition
 to
 the
 disputing
 Twelve
 As
 applicable
 to
 children
 of
 tender
 years
 and
 to
 childlike
 believers
 young
 and
 old
 the
 Savior
 gave
 to
 the
 apostles
 this
 solemn
 warning
 and
 profound
 statement
 of
 fact
 Take
 heed
 that
 ye
 despise
 not
 one
 of
 these
 little
 ones
 for
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 in
 heaven
 their
 angels
 do
 always
 behold
 the
 face
 of
 my
 Father
 which
 is
 in
 heaven
 The
 mission
 of
 the
 Christ
 was
 presented
 as
 that
 of
 saving
 those
 who
 are
 temporarily
 lost
 and
 who
 but
 for
 His
 aid
 would
 be
 lost
 forever
 In
 elucidation
 of
 His
 meaning
 the
 Teacher
 presented
 a
 parable
 which
 has
 found
 place
 among
 the
 literary
 treasures
 of
 the
 world
 THE
 PARABLE
 OF
 THE
 LOST
 SHEEP
 How
 think
 ye
 if
 a
 man
 have
 an
 hundred
 sheep
 and
 one
 of
 them
 be
 gone
 astray
 doth
 he
 not
 leave
 the
 ninety
 and
 nine
 and
 goeth
 into
 the
 mountains
 and
 seeketh
 that
 which
 is
 gone
 astray
 And
 if
 so
 be
 that
 he
 find
 it
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 he
 rejoiceth
 more
 of
 that
 sheep
 than
 of
 the
 ninety
 and
 nine
 which
 went
 not
 astray
 Even
 so
 it
 is
 not
 the
 will
 of
 your
 Father
 which
 is
 in
 heaven
 that
 one
 of
 these
 little
 ones
 should
 perish
 In
 this
 effective
 analogy
 the
 saving
 purpose
 of
 Christs
 mission
 is
 made
 prominent
 He
 is
 verily
 the
 Savior
 The
 shepherd
 is
 portrayed
 as
 leaving
 the
 ninety
 and
 nine
 pastured
 or
 folded
 in
 safety
 we
 cannot
 doubt
 while
 he
 goes
 alone
 into
 the
 mountains
 to
 seek
 the
 one
 that
 has
 strayed
 In
 finding
 and
 bringing
 back
 the
 wayward
 sheep
 he
 has
 more
 joy
 than
 that
 of
 knowing
 the
 others
 are
 yet
 safe
 In
 a
 later
 version
 of
 this
 splendid
 parable
 as
 addressed
 to
 the
 murmuring
 Pharisees
 and
 scribes
 at
 Jerusalem
 the
 Master
 said
 of
 the
 shepherd
 on
 his
 finding
 the
 lost
 sheep
 And
 when
 he
 hath
 found
 it
 he
 layeth
 it
 on
 his
 shoulders
 rejoicing
 And
 when
 he
 cometh
 home
 he
 calleth
 together
 his
 friends
 and
 neighbours
 saying
 unto
 them
 Rejoice
 with
 me
 for
 I
 have
 found
 my
 sheep
 which
 was
 lost
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 that
 likewise
 joy
 shall
 be
 in
 heaven
 over
 one
 sinner
 that
 repenteth
 more
 than
 over
 ninety
 and
 nine
 just
 persons
 which
 need
 no
 repentance
 Many
 have
 marveled
 that
 there
 should
 be
 greater
 rejoicing
 over
 the
 recovery
 of
 one
 stray
 sheep
 or
 the
 saving
 of
 a
 soul
 that
 had
 been
 as
 one
 lost
 than
 over
 the
 many
 who
 have
 not
 been
 in
 such
 jeopardy
 In
 the
 safefolded
 ninety
 and
 nine
 the
 shepherd
 had
 continued
 joy
 but
 to
 him
 came
 a
 new
 accession
 of
 happiness
 brighter
 and
 stronger
 because
 of
 his
 recent
 grief
 when
 the
 lost
 was
 brought
 back
 to
 the
 fold
 To
 this
 parable
 in
 connection
 with
 others
 of
 analogous
 import
 we
 shall
 recur
 in
 a
 later
 chapter
 IN
 MY
 NAME
 In
 continuation
 of
 the
 lesson
 illustrated
 by
 the
 little
 child
 Jesus
 said
 Whosoever
 shall
 receive
 this
 child
 in
 my
 name
 receiveth
 me
 and
 whosoever
 shall
 receive
 me
 receiveth
 him
 that
 sent
 me
 for
 he
 that
 is
 least
 among
 you
 all
 the
 same
 shall
 be
 great
 It
 may
 have
 been
 Christs
 reference
 to
 deeds
 done
 in
 His
 name
 that
 prompted
 John
 to
 interject
 a
 remark
 at
 this
 point
 Master
 we
 saw
 one
 casting
 out
 devils
 in
 thy
 name
 and
 he
 followeth
 not
 us
 and
 we
 forbad
 him
 because
 he
 followeth
 not
 us
 But
 Jesus
 said
 Forbid
 him
 not
 for
 there
 is
 no
 man
 which
 shall
 do
 a
 miracle
 in
 my
 name
 that
 can
 lightly
 speak
 evil
 of
 me
 For
 he
 that
 is
 not
 against
 us
 is
 on
 our
 part
 The
 young
 apostle
 had
 allowed
 his
 zeal
 for
 the
 Masters
 name
 to
 lead
 to
 intolerance
 That
 the
 man
 who
 had
 attempted
 to
 do
 good
 in
 the
 name
 of
 Jesus
 was
 evidently
 sincere
 and
 that
 his
 efforts
 were
 acceptable
 to
 the
 Lord
 we
 cannot
 doubt
 his
 act
 was
 essentially
 different
 from
 the
 unrighteous
 assumptions
 for
 which
 some
 others
 were
 afterward
 rebuked
 he
 was
 certainly
 a
 believer
 in
 Christ
 and
 may
 have
 been
 one
 of
 the
 class
 from
 which
 the
 Lord
 was
 soon
 to
 select
 and
 commission
 special
 ministers
 and
 the
 Seventy
 In
 the
 state
 of
 divided
 opinion
 then
 existing
 among
 the
 people
 concerning
 Jesus
 it
 was
 fair
 to
 say
 that
 all
 who
 were
 not
 opposed
 to
 Him
 were
 at
 least
 tentatively
 on
 His
 side
 On
 other
 occasions
 He
 asserted
 that
 those
 who
 were
 not
 with
 Him
 were
 against
 Him
 MY
 BROTHER
 AND
 I
 The
 proper
 method
 of
 adjusting
 differences
 between
 brethren
 and
 the
 fundamental
 principles
 of
 Church
 discipline
 were
 made
 subjects
 of
 instruction
 to
 the
 Twelve
 The
 first
 step
 is
 thus
 prescribed
 Moreover
 if
 thy
 brother
 shall
 trespass
 against
 thee
 go
 and
 tell
 him
 his
 fault
 between
 thee
 and
 him
 alone
 if
 he
 shall
 hear
 thee
 thou
 hast
 gained
 thy
 brother
 The
 rule
 of
 the
 rabbis
 was
 that
 the
 offender
 must
 make
 the
 first
 advance
 but
 Jesus
 taught
 that
 the
 injured
 one
 should
 not
 wait
 for
 his
 brother
 to
 come
 to
 him
 but
 go
 himself
 and
 seek
 to
 adjust
 the
 difficulty
 by
 so
 doing
 he
 might
 be
 the
 means
 of
 saving
 his
 brothers
 soul
 If
 the
 offender
 proved
 to
 be
 obdurate
 the
 brother
 who
 had
 suffered
 the
 trespass
 was
 to
 take
 two
 or
 three
 others
 with
 him
 and
 again
 try
 to
 bring
 the
 transgressor
 to
 repentant
 acknowledgment
 of
 his
 offense
 such
 a
 course
 provided
 for
 witnesses
 by
 whose
 presence
 later
 misrepresentation
 would
 be
 guarded
 against
 Extreme
 measures
 were
 to
 be
 adopted
 only
 after
 all
 gentler
 means
 had
 failed
 Should
 the
 man
 persist
 in
 his
 obstinacy
 the
 case
 was
 to
 be
 brought
 before
 the
 Church
 and
 in
 the
 event
 of
 his
 neglect
 or
 refusal
 to
 heed
 the
 decision
 of
 the
 Church
 he
 was
 to
 be
 deprived
 of
 fellowship
 thereby
 becoming
 in
 his
 relationship
 to
 his
 former
 associates
 as
 an
 heathen
 man
 and
 a
 publican
 In
 such
 state
 of
 nonmembership
 he
 would
 be
 a
 fit
 subject
 for
 missionary
 effort
 but
 until
 he
 became
 repentant
 and
 manifested
 willingness
 to
 make
 amends
 he
 could
 claim
 no
 rights
 or
 privileges
 of
 communion
 in
 the
 Church
 Continued
 association
 with
 the
 unrepentant
 sinner
 may
 involve
 the
 spread
 of
 his
 disaffection
 and
 the
 contamination
 of
 others
 through
 his
 sin
 Justice
 is
 not
 to
 be
 dethroned
 by
 Mercy
 The
 revealed
 order
 of
 discipline
 in
 the
 restored
 Church
 is
 similar
 to
 that
 given
 to
 the
 apostles
 of
 old
 The
 authority
 of
 the
 Twelve
 to
 administer
 the
 affairs
 of
 Church
 government
 was
 attested
 by
 the
 Lords
 confirming
 to
 them
 as
 a
 body
 the
 promise
 before
 addressed
 to
 Peter
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Whatsoever
 ye
 shall
 bind
 on
 earth
 shall
 be
 bound
 in
 heaven
 and
 whatsoever
 ye
 shall
 loose
 on
 earth
 shall
 be
 loosed
 in
 heaven
 Through
 unity
 of
 purpose
 and
 unreserved
 sincerity
 they
 would
 have
 power
 with
 God
 as
 witness
 the
 Masters
 further
 assurance
 Again
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 if
 two
 of
 you
 shall
 agree
 on
 earth
 as
 touching
 any
 thing
 that
 they
 shall
 ask
 it
 shall
 be
 done
 for
 them
 of
 my
 Father
 which
 is
 in
 heaven
 For
 where
 two
 or
 three
 are
 gathered
 together
 in
 my
 name
 there
 am
 I
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 them
 Peter
 here
 broke
 in
 with
 a
 question
 Lord
 how
 oft
 shall
 my
 brother
 sin
 against
 me
 and
 I
 forgive
 him
 till
 seven
 times
 He
 would
 fain
 have
 some
 definite
 limit
 set
 and
 he
 probably
 considered
 the
 tentative
 suggestion
 of
 seven
 times
 as
 a
 very
 liberal
 measure
 inasmuch
 as
 the
 rabbis
 prescribed
 a
 triple
 forgiveness
 only
 He
 may
 have
 chosen
 seven
 as
 the
 next
 number
 above
 three
 having
 a
 special
 Pharisaical
 significance
 The
 Saviors
 answer
 was
 enlightening
 Jesus
 saith
 unto
 him
 I
 say
 not
 unto
 thee
 Until
 seven
 times
 but
 Until
 seventy
 times
 seven
 This
 reply
 must
 have
 meant
 to
 Peter
 as
 it
 means
 to
 us
 that
 to
 forgiveness
 man
 may
 set
 no
 bounds
 the
 forgiveness
 however
 must
 be
 merited
 by
 the
 recipient
 The
 instruction
 was
 made
 memorable
 by
 the
 following
 story
 PARABLE
 OF
 THE
 UNMERCIFUL
 SERVANT
 Therefore
 is
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 likened
 unto
 a
 certain
 king
 which
 would
 take
 account
 of
 his
 servants
 And
 when
 he
 had
 begun
 to
 reckon
 one
 was
 brought
 unto
 him
 which
 owed
 him
 ten
 thousand
 talents
 But
 forasmuch
 as
 he
 had
 not
 to
 pay
 his
 lord
 commanded
 him
 to
 be
 sold
 and
 his
 wife
 and
 children
 and
 all
 that
 he
 had
 and
 payment
 to
 be
 made
 The
 servant
 therefore
 fell
 down
 and
 worshipped
 him
 saying
 Lord
 have
 patience
 with
 me
 and
 I
 will
 pay
 thee
 all
 Then
 the
 lord
 of
 that
 servant
 was
 moved
 with
 compassion
 and
 loosed
 him
 and
 forgave
 him
 the
 debt
 But
 the
 same
 servant
 went
 out
 and
 found
 one
 of
 his
 fellowservants
 which
 owed
 him
 an
 hundred
 pence
 and
 he
 laid
 hands
 on
 him
 and
 took
 him
 by
 the
 throat
 saying
 Pay
 me
 that
 thou
 owest
 And
 his
 fellowservant
 fell
 down
 at
 his
 feet
 and
 besought
 him
 saying
 Have
 patience
 with
 me
 and
 I
 will
 pay
 thee
 all
 And
 he
 would
 not
 but
 went
 and
 cast
 him
 into
 prison
 till
 he
 should
 pay
 the
 debt
 So
 when
 his
 fellowservants
 saw
 what
 was
 done
 they
 were
 very
 sorry
 and
 came
 and
 told
 unto
 their
 lord
 all
 that
 was
 done
 Then
 his
 lord
 after
 that
 he
 had
 called
 him
 said
 unto
 him
 O
 thou
 wicked
 servant
 I
 forgave
 thee
 all
 that
 debt
 because
 thou
 desiredst
 me
 Shouldest
 not
 thou
 also
 have
 had
 compassion
 on
 thy
 fellowservant
 even
 as
 I
 had
 pity
 on
 thee
 And
 his
 lord
 was
 wroth
 and
 delivered
 him
 to
 the
 tormentors
 till
 he
 should
 pay
 all
 that
 was
 due
 unto
 him
 So
 likewise
 shall
 my
 heavenly
 Father
 do
 also
 unto
 you
 if
 ye
 from
 your
 hearts
 forgive
 not
 every
 one
 his
 brother
 their
 trespasses
 Ten
 thousand
 talents
 are
 specified
 as
 expressive
 of
 a
 sum
 so
 great
 as
 to
 put
 the
 debtor
 beyond
 all
 reasonable
 possibility
 of
 paying
 We
 may
 regard
 the
 man
 as
 a
 trusted
 official
 one
 of
 the
 kings
 ministers
 who
 had
 been
 charged
 with
 the
 custody
 of
 the
 royal
 revenues
 or
 one
 of
 the
 chief
 treasurers
 of
 taxes
 that
 he
 is
 called
 a
 servant
 introduces
 no
 inconsistency
 as
 in
 an
 absolute
 monarchy
 all
 but
 the
 sovereign
 are
 subjects
 and
 servants
 The
 selling
 of
 the
 debtors
 wife
 and
 children
 and
 all
 that
 he
 had
 would
 not
 have
 been
 in
 violation
 of
 the
 law
 in
 the
 supposed
 case
 which
 implies
 the
 legal
 recognition
 of
 slavery
 The
 man
 was
 in
 arrears
 for
 debt
 He
 did
 not
 come
 before
 his
 lord
 voluntarily
 but
 had
 to
 be
 brought
 So
 in
 the
 affairs
 of
 our
 individual
 lives
 periodical
 reckonings
 are
 inevitable
 and
 while
 some
 debtors
 report
 of
 their
 own
 accord
 others
 have
 to
 be
 cited
 to
 appear
 The
 messengers
 who
 serve
 the
 summons
 may
 be
 adversity
 illness
 the
 approach
 of
 death
 but
 whatever
 whoever
 they
 are
 they
 enforce
 a
 rendering
 of
 our
 accounts
 The
 contrast
 between
 ten
 thousand
 talents
 and
 a
 hundred
 pence
 is
 enormous
 In
 his
 fellowservants
 plea
 for
 time
 in
 which
 to
 pay
 the
 hundred
 pence
 the
 greater
 debtor
 should
 have
 been
 reminded
 of
 the
 dire
 straits
 from
 which
 he
 had
 just
 been
 relieved
 the
 words
 Have
 patience
 with
 me
 and
 I
 will
 pay
 thee
 all
 were
 identical
 with
 those
 of
 his
 own
 prayer
 to
 the
 king
 The
 base
 ingratitude
 of
 the
 unmerciful
 servant
 justified
 the
 king
 in
 revoking
 the
 pardon
 once
 granted
 The
 man
 came
 under
 condemnation
 not
 primarily
 for
 defalcation
 and
 debt
 but
 for
 lack
 of
 mercy
 after
 having
 received
 of
 mercy
 so
 abundantly
 He
 as
 an
 unjust
 plaintiff
 had
 invoked
 the
 law
 as
 a
 convicted
 transgressor
 he
 was
 to
 be
 dealt
 with
 according
 to
 the
 law
 Mercy
 is
 for
 the
 merciful
 As
 a
 heavenly
 jewel
 it
 is
 to
 be
 received
 with
 thankfulness
 and
 used
 with
 sanctity
 not
 to
 be
 cast
 into
 the
 mire
 of
 undeservedness
 Justice
 may
 demand
 retribution
 and
 punishment
 With
 what
 measure
 ye
 mete
 it
 shall
 be
 measured
 to
 you
 again
 The
 conditions
 under
 which
 we
 may
 confidently
 implore
 pardon
 are
 set
 forth
 in
 the
 form
 of
 prayer
 prescribed
 by
 the
 Lord
 Forgive
 us
 our
 debts
 as
 we
 forgive
 our
 debtors

 Faith
 in
 Behalf
 of
 OthersThe
 supplication
 of
 the
 agonized
 father
 for
 the
 benefit
 of
 his
 sorely
 afflicted
 sonHave
 compassion
 on
 us
 and
 help
 us
 Mark
 shows
 that
 he
 made
 the
 boys
 case
 his
 own
 In
 this
 we
 are
 reminded
 of
 the
 Canaanite
 woman
 who
 implored
 Jesus
 to
 have
 mercy
 on
 her
 though
 her
 daughter
 was
 the
 afflicted
 one
 Matt
 
 page
 
 herein
 In
 these
 cases
 faith
 was
 exercized
 in
 behalf
 of
 the
 sufferers
 by
 others
 and
 the
 same
 is
 true
 of
 the
 centurion
 who
 pleaded
 for
 his
 servant
 and
 whose
 faith
 was
 specially
 commended
 by
 Jesus
 Matt
 
 page
 
 herein
 of
 Jairus
 whose
 daughter
 lay
 dead
 Luke
 
 
 
 
 page
 
 herein
 and
 of
 many
 who
 brought
 their
 helpless
 kindred
 or
 friends
 to
 Christ
 and
 pleaded
 for
 them
 As
 heretofore
 shown
 faith
 to
 be
 healed
 is
 as
 truly
 a
 gift
 of
 God
 as
 is
 faith
 to
 heal
 page
 
 and
 as
 the
 instances
 cited
 prove
 faith
 may
 be
 exercized
 with
 effect
 in
 behalf
 of
 others
 In
 connection
 with
 the
 ordinance
 of
 administering
 to
 the
 afflicted
 by
 anointing
 with
 oil
 and
 the
 laying
 on
 of
 hands
 as
 authoritatively
 established
 in
 the
 restored
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 the
 elders
 officiating
 should
 encourage
 the
 faith
 of
 all
 believers
 present
 that
 such
 be
 exerted
 in
 behalf
 of
 the
 sufferer
 In
 the
 case
 of
 infants
 and
 of
 persons
 who
 are
 unconscious
 it
 is
 plainly
 useless
 to
 look
 for
 active
 manifestation
 of
 faith
 on
 their
 part
 and
 the
 supporting
 faith
 of
 kindred
 and
 friends
 is
 all
 the
 more
 requisite
 
 Power
 Developed
 by
 Prayer
 and
 FastingThe
 Saviors
 statement
 concerning
 the
 evil
 spirit
 that
 the
 apostles
 were
 unable
 to
 subdueHowbeit
 this
 kind
 goeth
 not
 out
 but
 by
 prayer
 and
 fastingindicates
 gradation
 in
 the
 malignity
 and
 evil
 power
 of
 demons
 and
 gradation
 also
 in
 the
 results
 of
 varying
 degrees
 of
 faith
 The
 apostles
 who
 failed
 on
 the
 occasion
 referred
 to
 had
 been
 able
 to
 cast
 out
 demons
 at
 other
 times
 Fasting
 when
 practised
 in
 prudence
 and
 genuine
 prayer
 are
 conducive
 to
 the
 development
 of
 faith
 with
 its
 accompanying
 power
 for
 good
 Individual
 application
 of
 this
 principle
 may
 be
 made
 with
 profit
 Have
 you
 some
 besetting
 weakness
 some
 sinful
 indulgence
 that
 you
 have
 vainly
 tried
 to
 overcome
 Like
 the
 malignant
 demon
 that
 Christ
 rebuked
 in
 the
 boy
 your
 sin
 may
 be
 of
 a
 kind
 that
 goeth
 out
 only
 through
 prayer
 and
 fasting
 
 Nothing
 Impossible
 to
 FaithMany
 people
 have
 questioned
 the
 literal
 truth
 of
 the
 Lords
 declaration
 that
 by
 faith
 mountains
 may
 be
 removed
 from
 their
 place
 Plainly
 there
 would
 have
 to
 be
 a
 purpose
 in
 harmony
 with
 the
 divine
 mind
 and
 plan
 in
 order
 that
 faith
 could
 be
 exerted
 at
 all
 in
 such
 an
 undertaking
 Neither
 such
 a
 miracle
 nor
 any
 other
 is
 possible
 as
 a
 gratification
 of
 the
 yearning
 for
 curiosity
 nor
 for
 display
 nor
 for
 personal
 gain
 or
 selfish
 satisfaction
 Christ
 wrought
 no
 miracle
 with
 any
 such
 motive
 He
 persistently
 refused
 to
 show
 signs
 to
 mere
 signseekers
 But
 to
 deny
 the
 possibility
 of
 a
 mountain
 being
 removed
 through
 faith
 under
 conditions
 that
 would
 render
 such
 removal
 acceptable
 to
 God
 is
 to
 deny
 the
 word
 of
 God
 both
 as
 to
 this
 specific
 possibility
 and
 as
 to
 the
 general
 assurance
 that
 nothing
 shall
 be
 impossible
 to
 him
 who
 hath
 faith
 adequate
 to
 the
 end
 desired
 It
 is
 worthy
 of
 note
 however
 that
 the
 Jews
 in
 the
 days
 of
 Christ
 and
 since
 often
 spoke
 of
 removing
 mountains
 as
 a
 figurative
 expression
 for
 the
 overcoming
 of
 difficulties
 According
 to
 Lightfoot
 and
 other
 authorities
 a
 man
 able
 to
 solve
 intricate
 problems
 or
 of
 particular
 power
 in
 argument
 or
 acumen
 in
 judgment
 was
 referred
 to
 as
 a
 rooter
 up
 of
 mountains
 
 The
 Temple
 TributeThat
 the
 tribute
 money
 referred
 to
 in
 the
 text
 was
 a
 Jewish
 contribution
 to
 the
 temple
 and
 not
 a
 tax
 levied
 by
 the
 Roman
 government
 is
 apparent
 from
 the
 specification
 of
 the
 didrachma
 which
 in
 the
 authorized
 version
 is
 translated
 tribute
 This
 coin
 was
 equivalent
 to
 the
 half
 shekel
 reckoned
 after
 the
 shekel
 of
 the
 sanctuary
 which
 was
 the
 fixed
 amount
 to
 be
 paid
 annually
 by
 every
 male
 from
 twenty
 years
 old
 and
 above
 with
 the
 provision
 that
 the
 rich
 shall
 not
 give
 more
 and
 the
 poor
 shall
 not
 give
 less
 Exo
 
 A
 tax
 levied
 by
 the
 political
 powers
 would
 not
 be
 designated
 as
 the
 didrachma
 Moreover
 had
 the
 collector
 who
 approached
 Peter
 been
 one
 of
 the
 official
 publicans
 he
 probably
 would
 have
 demanded
 the
 tax
 instead
 of
 inquiring
 as
 to
 whether
 or
 not
 the
 Master
 was
 to
 be
 counted
 among
 the
 contributors
 Among
 the
 many
 humiliations
 to
 which
 the
 Jews
 were
 subjected
 in
 later
 years
 after
 the
 destruction
 of
 the
 temple
 was
 the
 compulsory
 payment
 of
 what
 had
 been
 their
 temple
 tribute
 to
 the
 Romans
 who
 decreed
 it
 as
 a
 revenue
 to
 the
 pagan
 temple
 of
 Jupiter
 Capitolinus
 Of
 the
 emperor
 Vespasian
 Josephus
 Wars
 of
 the
 Jews
 vii
 
 says
 That
 he
 also
 laid
 a
 tribute
 wheresoever
 they
 were
 and
 enjoined
 every
 one
 of
 them
 to
 bring
 two
 drachm
 every
 year
 into
 the
 capitol
 as
 they
 used
 to
 pay
 the
 same
 to
 the
 temple
 at
 Jerusalem
 
 Talents
 and
 PenceIt
 is
 evident
 that
 by
 specifying
 ten
 thousand
 talents
 as
 the
 debt
 due
 the
 king
 and
 a
 hundred
 pence
 as
 that
 owed
 by
 the
 fellowservant
 the
 Lord
 intended
 to
 present
 a
 case
 of
 great
 disparity
 and
 striking
 contrast
 The
 actual
 amounts
 involved
 are
 of
 minor
 significance
 in
 the
 story
 We
 are
 not
 told
 which
 variety
 of
 talent
 was
 meant
 there
 were
 Attic
 talents
 and
 both
 silver
 and
 gold
 talents
 of
 Hebrew
 reckoning
 and
 each
 differed
 from
 the
 others
 in
 value
 The
 Oxford
 marginal
 explanation
 is
 A
 talent
 is
 
 ounces
 of
 silver
 which
 after
 five
 shillings
 the
 ounce
 is
 
 pounds
 ten
 shillings
 This
 would
 be
 in
 American
 money
 over
 nine
 and
 a
 quarter
 millions
 of
 dollars
 as
 the
 sum
 of
 the
 ten
 thousand
 talents
 The
 same
 authority
 gives
 as
 the
 value
 of
 the
 penny
 Roman
 sevenpence
 halfpenny
 or
 fifteen
 cents
 making
 the
 second
 debt
 equivalent
 to
 about
 fifteen
 dollars
 Comparison
 with
 talents
 mentioned
 elsewhere
 may
 be
 allowable
 Trench
 says
 How
 vast
 a
 sum
 it
 was
 we
 can
 most
 vividly
 realize
 to
 ourselves
 by
 comparing
 it
 with
 other
 sums
 mentioned
 in
 Scripture
 In
 the
 construction
 of
 the
 tabernacle
 twentynine
 talents
 of
 gold
 were
 used
 Exo
 
 David
 prepared
 for
 the
 temple
 three
 thousand
 talents
 of
 gold
 and
 the
 princes
 five
 thousand
 
 Chron
 
 the
 queen
 of
 Sheba
 presented
 to
 Solomon
 one
 hundred
 and
 twenty
 talents
 
 Kings
 
 the
 king
 of
 Assyria
 laid
 upon
 Hezekiah
 thirty
 talents
 of
 gold
 
 Kings
 
 and
 in
 the
 extreme
 impoverishment
 to
 which
 the
 land
 was
 brought
 at
 the
 last
 one
 talent
 of
 gold
 was
 laid
 upon
 it
 after
 the
 death
 of
 Josiah
 by
 the
 king
 of
 Egypt
 
 Chron
 
 Farrar
 estimates
 the
 debt
 owed
 to
 the
 king
 as
 
 times
 that
 owed
 by
 the
 lesser
 to
 the
 greater
 debtor
 
 An
 Assumed
 Approval
 of
 SlaverySome
 readers
 have
 assumed
 that
 they
 find
 in
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Unmerciful
 Servant
 an
 implied
 approval
 of
 the
 institution
 of
 slavery
 The
 greater
 debtor
 who
 figures
 in
 the
 story
 was
 to
 be
 sold
 together
 with
 his
 wife
 and
 children
 and
 all
 that
 he
 had
 A
 rational
 consideration
 of
 the
 story
 as
 a
 whole
 is
 likely
 to
 find
 at
 most
 in
 the
 particular
 incident
 of
 the
 kings
 command
 that
 the
 debtor
 and
 his
 family
 be
 sold
 that
 the
 system
 of
 buying
 and
 selling
 bondservants
 serfs
 or
 slaves
 was
 legally
 recognized
 at
 the
 time
 The
 purpose
 of
 the
 parable
 was
 not
 even
 remotely
 to
 endorse
 or
 condemn
 slavery
 or
 any
 other
 social
 institution
 The
 Mosaic
 law
 is
 explicit
 in
 matters
 relating
 to
 bondservants
 The
 angel
 of
 the
 Lord
 who
 brought
 to
 Hagar
 a
 message
 of
 encouragement
 and
 blessing
 respected
 the
 authority
 of
 her
 mistress
 Gen
 
 
 In
 the
 apostolic
 epoch
 instruction
 was
 directed
 toward
 right
 living
 under
 the
 secular
 law
 not
 rebellion
 against
 the
 system
 Eph
 
 Col
 
 
 Tim
 
 
 Peter
 
 Recognition
 of
 established
 customs
 institutions
 and
 laws
 and
 proper
 obedience
 thereto
 do
 not
 necessarily
 imply
 individual
 approval
 The
 gospel
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 which
 shall
 yet
 regenerate
 the
 world
 is
 to
 prevailnot
 by
 revolutionary
 assaults
 upon
 existing
 governments
 nor
 through
 anarchy
 and
 violencebut
 by
 the
 teaching
 of
 individual
 duty
 and
 by
 the
 spread
 of
 the
 spirit
 of
 love
 When
 the
 love
 of
 God
 shall
 be
 given
 a
 place
 in
 the
 hearts
 of
 mankind
 when
 men
 shall
 unselfishly
 love
 their
 neighbors
 then
 social
 systems
 and
 governments
 shall
 be
 formed
 and
 operated
 to
 the
 securing
 of
 the
 greatest
 good
 to
 the
 greatest
 number
 Until
 men
 open
 their
 hearts
 to
 the
 reception
 of
 the
 gospel
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 injustice
 and
 oppression
 servitude
 and
 slavery
 in
 some
 form
 or
 other
 are
 sure
 to
 exist
 Attempts
 to
 extirpate
 social
 conditions
 that
 spring
 from
 individual
 selfishness
 cannot
 be
 otherwise
 than
 futile
 so
 long
 as
 selfishness
 is
 left
 to
 thrive
 and
 propagate

 CHAPTER
 
 JESUS
 AGAIN
 IN
 JERUSALEM
 DEPARTURE
 FROM
 GALILEE
 Of
 our
 Lords
 labors
 during
 His
 brief
 sojourn
 in
 Galilee
 following
 His
 return
 from
 the
 region
 of
 Csarea
 Philippi
 we
 have
 no
 record
 aside
 from
 that
 of
 His
 instructions
 to
 the
 apostles
 His
 Galilean
 ministry
 so
 far
 as
 the
 people
 in
 general
 were
 concerned
 had
 practically
 ended
 with
 the
 discourse
 at
 Capernaum
 on
 His
 return
 thither
 after
 the
 miracles
 of
 feeding
 the
 five
 thousand
 and
 walking
 upon
 the
 sea
 At
 Capernaum
 many
 of
 the
 disciples
 had
 turned
 away
 from
 the
 Master
 and
 now
 after
 another
 short
 visit
 He
 prepared
 to
 leave
 the
 land
 in
 which
 so
 great
 a
 part
 of
 His
 public
 work
 had
 been
 accomplished
 It
 was
 autumn
 about
 six
 months
 had
 passed
 since
 the
 return
 of
 the
 apostles
 from
 their
 missionary
 tour
 and
 the
 Feast
 of
 Tabernacles
 was
 near
 at
 hand
 Some
 of
 the
 kinsmen
 of
 Jesus
 came
 to
 Him
 and
 proposed
 that
 He
 go
 to
 Jerusalem
 and
 take
 advantage
 of
 the
 opportunity
 offered
 by
 the
 great
 national
 festival
 to
 declare
 Himself
 more
 openly
 than
 He
 had
 theretofore
 done
 His
 brethren
 as
 the
 visiting
 relatives
 are
 called
 urged
 that
 He
 seek
 a
 broader
 and
 more
 prominent
 field
 than
 Galilee
 for
 the
 display
 of
 His
 powers
 arguing
 that
 it
 was
 inconsistent
 for
 any
 man
 to
 keep
 himself
 in
 comparative
 obscurity
 when
 he
 wanted
 to
 be
 widely
 known
 Shew
 thyself
 to
 the
 world
 said
 they
 Whatever
 their
 motives
 may
 have
 been
 these
 brethren
 of
 His
 did
 not
 advize
 more
 extended
 publicity
 through
 any
 zeal
 for
 His
 divine
 mission
 indeed
 we
 are
 expressly
 told
 that
 they
 did
 not
 believe
 in
 Him
 Jesus
 replied
 to
 their
 presumptuous
 advice
 My
 time
 is
 not
 yet
 come
 but
 your
 time
 is
 alway
 ready
 The
 world
 cannot
 hate
 you
 but
 me
 it
 hateth
 because
 I
 testify
 of
 it
 that
 the
 works
 thereof
 are
 evil
 Go
 ye
 up
 unto
 this
 feast
 I
 go
 not
 up
 yet
 unto
 this
 feast
 for
 my
 time
 is
 not
 yet
 full
 come
 It
 was
 not
 their
 prerogative
 to
 direct
 His
 movements
 not
 to
 say
 when
 He
 should
 do
 even
 what
 He
 intended
 to
 do
 eventually
 He
 made
 it
 plain
 that
 between
 their
 status
 and
 His
 there
 was
 essential
 difference
 they
 were
 of
 the
 world
 which
 they
 loved
 as
 the
 world
 loved
 them
 but
 the
 world
 hated
 Him
 because
 of
 His
 testimony
 This
 colloquy
 between
 Jesus
 and
 His
 brethren
 took
 place
 in
 Galilee
 They
 soon
 started
 for
 Jerusalem
 leaving
 Him
 behind
 He
 had
 not
 said
 that
 He
 would
 not
 go
 to
 the
 feast
 but
 only
 I
 go
 not
 up
 yet
 unto
 this
 feast
 for
 my
 time
 is
 not
 yet
 full
 come
 Some
 time
 after
 their
 departure
 He
 followed
 traveling
 not
 openly
 but
 as
 it
 were
 in
 secret
 Whether
 He
 went
 alone
 or
 accompanied
 by
 any
 or
 all
 of
 the
 Twelve
 we
 are
 not
 told
 AT
 THE
 FEAST
 OF
 TABERNACLES
 The
 agitated
 state
 of
 the
 public
 mind
 respecting
 Jesus
 is
 shown
 by
 the
 interest
 manifest
 in
 Jerusalem
 as
 to
 the
 probability
 of
 His
 presence
 at
 the
 feast
 His
 brethren
 who
 probably
 were
 questioned
 could
 give
 no
 definite
 information
 as
 to
 His
 coming
 He
 was
 sought
 for
 in
 the
 crowds
 there
 was
 much
 discussion
 and
 some
 disputation
 concerning
 Him
 Many
 people
 expressed
 their
 conviction
 that
 He
 was
 a
 good
 man
 while
 others
 contradicted
 on
 the
 claim
 that
 He
 was
 a
 deceiver
 There
 was
 little
 open
 discussion
 however
 for
 the
 people
 were
 afraid
 of
 incurring
 the
 displeasure
 of
 the
 rulers
 As
 originally
 established
 the
 Feast
 of
 Tabernacles
 was
 a
 seven
 day
 festival
 followed
 by
 a
 holy
 convocation
 on
 the
 eighth
 day
 Each
 day
 was
 marked
 by
 special
 and
 in
 some
 respects
 distinctive
 services
 all
 characterized
 by
 ceremonies
 of
 thanksgiving
 and
 praise
 Now
 about
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 feast
 probably
 on
 the
 third
 or
 fourth
 day
 Jesus
 went
 up
 into
 the
 temple
 and
 taught
 The
 first
 part
 of
 His
 discourse
 is
 not
 recorded
 but
 its
 scriptural
 soundness
 is
 intimated
 in
 the
 surprize
 of
 the
 Jewish
 teachers
 who
 asked
 among
 themselves
 How
 knoweth
 this
 man
 letters
 having
 never
 learned
 He
 was
 no
 graduate
 of
 their
 schools
 He
 had
 never
 sat
 at
 the
 feet
 of
 their
 rabbis
 He
 had
 not
 been
 officially
 accredited
 by
 them
 nor
 licensed
 to
 teach
 Whence
 came
 His
 wisdom
 before
 which
 all
 their
 academic
 attainments
 were
 as
 nothing
 Jesus
 answered
 their
 troubled
 queries
 saying
 My
 doctrine
 is
 not
 mine
 but
 his
 that
 sent
 me
 If
 any
 man
 will
 do
 his
 will
 he
 shall
 know
 of
 the
 doctrine
 whether
 it
 be
 of
 God
 or
 whether
 I
 speak
 of
 myself
 His
 Teacher
 greater
 even
 than
 Himself
 was
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 whose
 will
 He
 proclaimed
 The
 test
 proposed
 to
 determine
 the
 truth
 of
 His
 doctrine
 was
 in
 every
 way
 fair
 and
 withal
 simple
 anyone
 who
 would
 earnestly
 seek
 to
 do
 the
 will
 of
 the
 Father
 should
 know
 of
 himself
 whether
 Jesus
 spoke
 truth
 or
 error
 The
 Master
 proceeded
 to
 show
 that
 a
 man
 who
 speaks
 on
 his
 own
 authority
 alone
 seeks
 to
 aggrandize
 himself
 Jesus
 did
 not
 so
 He
 honored
 His
 Teacher
 His
 Father
 His
 God
 not
 Himself
 and
 therefore
 was
 He
 free
 from
 the
 taint
 of
 selfish
 pride
 or
 unrighteousness
 Moses
 had
 given
 them
 the
 law
 and
 yet
 as
 Jesus
 affirmed
 none
 of
 them
 kept
 the
 law
 Then
 with
 startling
 abruptness
 He
 challenged
 them
 with
 the
 question
 Why
 go
 ye
 about
 to
 kill
 me
 On
 many
 occasions
 had
 they
 held
 dark
 counsel
 with
 one
 another
 as
 to
 how
 they
 could
 get
 Him
 into
 their
 power
 and
 put
 Him
 to
 death
 but
 they
 thought
 that
 the
 murderous
 secret
 was
 hidden
 within
 their
 own
 circle
 The
 people
 had
 heard
 the
 seducing
 assertions
 of
 the
 ruling
 classes
 that
 Jesus
 was
 possessed
 by
 a
 demon
 and
 that
 He
 wrought
 wonders
 through
 the
 power
 of
 Beelzebub
 and
 in
 the
 spirit
 of
 this
 blasphemous
 slander
 they
 cried
 out
 Thou
 hast
 a
 devil
 who
 goeth
 about
 to
 kill
 thee
 Jesus
 knew
 that
 the
 two
 specifications
 of
 alleged
 guilt
 on
 which
 the
 rulers
 were
 striving
 most
 assiduously
 to
 convict
 Him
 in
 the
 popular
 mind
 and
 so
 turn
 the
 people
 against
 Him
 were
 those
 of
 Sabbathbreaking
 and
 blasphemy
 On
 an
 earlier
 visit
 to
 Jerusalem
 He
 had
 healed
 an
 afflicted
 man
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 and
 had
 utterly
 disconcerted
 the
 hypercritical
 accusers
 who
 even
 then
 had
 sought
 to
 compass
 His
 death
 To
 this
 act
 of
 mercy
 and
 power
 Jesus
 now
 referred
 saying
 I
 have
 done
 one
 work
 and
 ye
 all
 marvel
 Seemingly
 they
 were
 still
 of
 unsettled
 mind
 in
 doubt
 as
 to
 accepting
 Him
 because
 of
 the
 miracle
 or
 denouncing
 Him
 because
 He
 had
 done
 it
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 Then
 He
 showed
 the
 inconsistency
 of
 charging
 Him
 with
 Sabbathdesecration
 for
 such
 a
 merciful
 deed
 when
 the
 law
 of
 Moses
 expressly
 allowed
 acts
 of
 mercy
 and
 even
 required
 that
 the
 mandatory
 rite
 of
 circumcision
 should
 not
 be
 deferred
 because
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 Judge
 not
 according
 to
 the
 appearance
 but
 judge
 righteous
 judgment
 said
 He
 The
 masses
 were
 still
 divided
 in
 their
 estimate
 of
 Jesus
 and
 were
 moreover
 puzzled
 over
 the
 indecision
 of
 the
 rulers
 Some
 of
 the
 Jerusalem
 Jews
 knew
 of
 the
 plan
 to
 arrest
 Him
 and
 if
 possible
 to
 bring
 Him
 to
 death
 and
 the
 people
 queried
 why
 nothing
 was
 done
 when
 He
 was
 there
 teaching
 publicly
 within
 reach
 of
 the
 officials
 They
 wondered
 whether
 the
 rulers
 had
 not
 at
 last
 come
 to
 believe
 that
 Jesus
 was
 indeed
 the
 Messiah
 The
 thought
 however
 was
 brushed
 aside
 when
 they
 remembered
 that
 all
 knew
 whence
 He
 came
 He
 was
 a
 Galilean
 and
 from
 Nazareth
 whereas
 as
 they
 had
 been
 taught
 however
 wrongly
 the
 advent
 of
 the
 Christ
 was
 to
 be
 mysterious
 so
 that
 none
 would
 know
 whence
 He
 came
 Strange
 it
 was
 indeed
 that
 men
 should
 reject
 Him
 because
 of
 a
 lack
 of
 mystery
 and
 miracle
 in
 His
 advent
 when
 had
 they
 known
 the
 truth
 they
 would
 have
 seen
 in
 His
 birth
 a
 miracle
 without
 precedent
 or
 parallel
 in
 the
 annals
 of
 time
 Jesus
 directly
 answered
 their
 weak
 and
 faulty
 reasoning
 Crying
 aloud
 within
 the
 temple
 courts
 He
 assured
 them
 that
 while
 they
 knew
 whence
 He
 came
 as
 one
 of
 their
 number
 yet
 they
 did
 not
 know
 that
 He
 had
 come
 from
 God
 neither
 did
 they
 know
 God
 who
 had
 sent
 Him
 But
 He
 added
 I
 know
 him
 for
 I
 am
 from
 him
 and
 he
 hath
 sent
 me
 At
 this
 reiterated
 testimony
 of
 His
 divine
 origin
 the
 Jews
 were
 the
 more
 enraged
 and
 they
 determined
 anew
 to
 take
 Him
 by
 force
 nevertheless
 none
 laid
 hands
 upon
 him
 because
 his
 hour
 was
 not
 yet
 come
 Many
 of
 the
 people
 believed
 in
 their
 hearts
 that
 He
 was
 of
 God
 and
 ventured
 to
 ask
 among
 themselves
 whether
 Christ
 would
 do
 greater
 works
 than
 Jesus
 had
 done
 The
 Pharisees
 and
 chief
 priests
 feared
 a
 possible
 demonstration
 in
 favor
 of
 Jesus
 and
 forthwith
 sent
 officers
 to
 arrest
 Him
 and
 bring
 him
 before
 the
 Sanhedrin
 The
 presence
 of
 the
 temple
 police
 caused
 no
 interruption
 to
 the
 Masters
 discourse
 though
 we
 may
 reasonably
 infer
 that
 He
 knew
 the
 purpose
 of
 their
 errand
 He
 spoke
 on
 saying
 that
 He
 would
 be
 with
 the
 people
 but
 a
 little
 while
 and
 that
 after
 He
 had
 returned
 to
 the
 Father
 they
 would
 seek
 Him
 vainly
 for
 where
 He
 would
 then
 be
 they
 could
 not
 come
 This
 remark
 evoked
 more
 bitter
 discussion
 Some
 of
 the
 Jews
 wondered
 whether
 He
 intended
 to
 leave
 the
 borders
 of
 the
 land
 and
 go
 among
 the
 Gentiles
 to
 teach
 them
 and
 the
 dispersed
 Israelites
 As
 part
 of
 the
 temple
 service
 incident
 to
 the
 feast
 the
 people
 went
 in
 procession
 to
 the
 Pool
 of
 Siloam
 where
 a
 priest
 filled
 a
 golden
 ewer
 which
 he
 then
 carried
 to
 the
 altar
 and
 there
 poured
 out
 the
 water
 to
 the
 accompaniment
 of
 trumpet
 blasts
 and
 the
 acclamations
 of
 the
 assembled
 hosts
 According
 to
 authorities
 on
 Jewish
 customs
 this
 feature
 was
 omitted
 on
 the
 closing
 day
 of
 the
 feast
 On
 this
 last
 or
 great
 day
 which
 was
 marked
 by
 ceremonies
 of
 unusual
 solemnity
 and
 rejoicing
 Jesus
 was
 again
 in
 the
 temple
 It
 may
 have
 been
 with
 reference
 to
 the
 bringing
 of
 water
 from
 the
 pool
 or
 to
 the
 omission
 of
 the
 ceremony
 from
 the
 ritualistic
 procedure
 of
 the
 great
 day
 that
 Jesus
 cried
 aloud
 His
 voice
 resounding
 through
 the
 courts
 and
 arcades
 of
 the
 temple
 If
 any
 man
 thirst
 let
 him
 come
 unto
 me
 and
 drink
 He
 that
 believeth
 on
 me
 as
 the
 scripture
 hath
 said
 out
 of
 his
 belly
 shall
 flow
 rivers
 of
 living
 water
 John
 the
 recorder
 remarks
 parenthetically
 that
 this
 promise
 had
 reference
 to
 the
 bestowal
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 which
 at
 that
 time
 had
 not
 been
 granted
 nor
 was
 it
 to
 be
 until
 after
 the
 ascension
 of
 the
 risen
 Lord
 Again
 many
 of
 the
 people
 were
 so
 impressed
 that
 they
 declared
 Jesus
 could
 be
 none
 other
 than
 the
 Messiah
 but
 others
 objected
 saying
 that
 the
 Christ
 must
 come
 from
 Bethlehem
 of
 Judea
 and
 Jesus
 was
 known
 to
 have
 come
 from
 Galilee
 So
 there
 was
 further
 dissension
 and
 though
 some
 wanted
 Him
 apprehended
 not
 a
 man
 was
 found
 who
 would
 venture
 to
 lay
 hold
 on
 Him
 The
 police
 officers
 returned
 without
 their
 intended
 prisoner
 To
 the
 angry
 demand
 of
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 Pharisees
 as
 to
 why
 they
 had
 not
 brought
 Him
 they
 acknowledged
 that
 they
 had
 been
 so
 affected
 by
 His
 teachings
 as
 to
 be
 unable
 to
 make
 the
 arrest
 Never
 man
 spake
 like
 this
 man
 they
 said
 Their
 haughty
 masters
 were
 furious
 Are
 ye
 also
 deceived
 they
 demanded
 and
 further
 Have
 any
 of
 the
 rulers
 or
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 believed
 on
 him
 What
 was
 the
 opinion
 of
 the
 common
 people
 worth
 They
 had
 never
 learned
 the
 law
 and
 were
 therefore
 accursed
 and
 of
 no
 concern
 Yet
 with
 all
 this
 show
 of
 proud
 disdain
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 Pharisees
 were
 afraid
 of
 the
 common
 people
 and
 were
 again
 halted
 in
 their
 wicked
 course
 One
 voice
 of
 mild
 protest
 was
 heard
 in
 the
 assembly
 Nicodemus
 a
 member
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 and
 the
 same
 who
 had
 come
 to
 Jesus
 by
 night
 to
 inquire
 into
 the
 new
 teaching
 mustered
 courage
 enough
 to
 ask
 Doth
 our
 law
 judge
 any
 man
 before
 it
 hear
 him
 and
 know
 what
 he
 doeth
 The
 answer
 was
 insulting
 Maddened
 with
 bigotry
 and
 bloodthirsty
 fanaticism
 some
 of
 his
 colleagues
 turned
 upon
 him
 with
 the
 savage
 demand
 Art
 thou
 also
 of
 Galilee
 meaning
 Art
 thou
 also
 a
 disciple
 of
 this
 Galilean
 whom
 we
 hate
 Nicodemus
 was
 curtly
 told
 to
 study
 the
 scriptures
 and
 he
 would
 fail
 to
 find
 any
 prediction
 of
 a
 prophet
 arising
 in
 Galilee
 The
 anger
 of
 these
 learned
 bigots
 had
 blinded
 them
 even
 to
 their
 own
 vaunted
 knowledge
 for
 several
 of
 the
 ancient
 prophets
 were
 regarded
 as
 Galileans
 if
 however
 they
 had
 meant
 to
 refer
 only
 to
 that
 Prophet
 of
 whom
 Moses
 had
 spoken
 the
 Messiah
 they
 were
 correct
 since
 all
 predictions
 pointed
 to
 Bethlehem
 in
 Judea
 as
 His
 birthplace
 It
 is
 evident
 that
 Jesus
 was
 thought
 of
 as
 a
 native
 of
 Nazareth
 and
 that
 the
 circumstances
 of
 His
 birth
 were
 not
 of
 public
 knowledge
 GO
 AND
 SIN
 NO
 MORE
 After
 the
 festivities
 were
 over
 Jesus
 went
 to
 the
 temple
 one
 morning
 early
 and
 as
 He
 sat
 probably
 in
 the
 Court
 of
 the
 Women
 which
 was
 the
 usual
 place
 of
 public
 resort
 many
 gathered
 about
 Him
 and
 He
 proceeded
 to
 teach
 them
 as
 was
 His
 custom
 His
 discourse
 was
 interrupted
 by
 the
 arrival
 of
 a
 party
 of
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 with
 a
 woman
 in
 charge
 who
 they
 said
 was
 guilty
 of
 adultery
 To
 Jesus
 they
 presented
 this
 statement
 and
 question
 Now
 Moses
 in
 the
 law
 commanded
 us
 that
 such
 should
 be
 stoned
 but
 what
 sayest
 thou
 The
 submitting
 of
 the
 case
 to
 Jesus
 was
 a
 prearranged
 snare
 a
 deliberate
 attempt
 to
 find
 or
 make
 a
 cause
 for
 accusing
 Him
 Though
 it
 was
 not
 unusual
 for
 Jewish
 officials
 to
 consult
 rabbis
 of
 recognized
 wisdom
 and
 experience
 when
 difficult
 cases
 were
 to
 be
 decided
 the
 case
 in
 point
 involved
 no
 legal
 complications
 The
 womans
 guilt
 seems
 to
 have
 been
 unquestioned
 though
 the
 witnesses
 required
 by
 the
 statutes
 are
 not
 mentioned
 as
 appearing
 unless
 the
 accusing
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 are
 to
 be
 so
 considered
 the
 law
 was
 explicit
 and
 the
 custom
 of
 the
 times
 in
 dealing
 with
 such
 offenders
 was
 well
 known
 While
 it
 is
 true
 that
 the
 law
 of
 Moses
 had
 decreed
 death
 by
 stoning
 as
 the
 penalty
 for
 adultery
 the
 infliction
 of
 the
 extreme
 punishment
 had
 lapsed
 long
 before
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 One
 may
 reasonably
 ask
 why
 the
 womans
 partner
 in
 the
 crime
 was
 not
 brought
 for
 sentence
 since
 the
 law
 so
 zealously
 cited
 by
 the
 officious
 accusers
 provided
 for
 the
 punishment
 of
 both
 parties
 to
 the
 offense
 The
 question
 of
 the
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 But
 what
 sayest
 thou
 may
 have
 intimated
 their
 expectation
 that
 Jesus
 would
 declare
 the
 law
 obsolete
 perhaps
 they
 had
 heard
 of
 the
 Sermon
 on
 the
 Mount
 in
 which
 many
 requirements
 in
 advance
 of
 the
 Mosaic
 code
 had
 been
 proclaimed
 Had
 Jesus
 decided
 that
 the
 wretched
 woman
 ought
 to
 suffer
 death
 her
 accusers
 might
 have
 said
 that
 he
 was
 defying
 the
 existing
 authorities
 and
 possibly
 the
 charge
 of
 opposition
 to
 the
 Roman
 government
 might
 have
 been
 formulated
 since
 power
 to
 inflict
 the
 death
 penalty
 had
 been
 taken
 from
 all
 Jewish
 tribunals
 and
 moreover
 the
 crime
 with
 which
 this
 woman
 was
 charged
 was
 not
 a
 capital
 offense
 under
 Roman
 law
 Had
 He
 said
 that
 the
 woman
 should
 go
 unpunished
 or
 suffer
 only
 minor
 infliction
 the
 crafty
 Jews
 could
 have
 charged
 Him
 with
 disrespect
 for
 the
 law
 of
 Moses
 To
 these
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 Jesus
 at
 first
 gave
 little
 heed
 Stooping
 down
 He
 traced
 with
 His
 finger
 on
 the
 ground
 but
 as
 He
 wrote
 they
 continued
 to
 question
 Him
 Lifting
 Himself
 up
 He
 answered
 them
 in
 a
 terse
 sentence
 that
 has
 become
 proverbial
 He
 that
 is
 without
 sin
 among
 you
 let
 him
 first
 cast
 a
 stone
 at
 her
 Such
 was
 the
 law
 the
 accusers
 on
 whose
 testimony
 the
 death
 penalty
 was
 pronounced
 were
 to
 be
 the
 first
 to
 begin
 the
 work
 of
 execution
 Having
 spoken
 Jesus
 again
 stooped
 and
 wrote
 upon
 the
 ground
 The
 womans
 accusers
 were
 convicted
 by
 their
 own
 conscience
 shamed
 and
 in
 disgrace
 they
 slunk
 away
 all
 of
 them
 from
 the
 eldest
 to
 the
 youngest
 They
 knew
 themselves
 to
 be
 unfit
 to
 appear
 either
 as
 accusers
 or
 judges
 What
 cowards
 doth
 conscience
 make
 When
 Jesus
 had
 lifted
 up
 himself
 and
 saw
 none
 but
 the
 woman
 he
 said
 unto
 her
 Woman
 where
 are
 those
 thine
 accusers
 hath
 no
 man
 condemned
 thee
 She
 said
 No
 man
 Lord
 And
 Jesus
 said
 unto
 her
 Neither
 do
 I
 condemn
 thee
 go
 and
 sin
 no
 more
 The
 woman
 was
 repentant
 she
 remained
 humbly
 awaiting
 the
 Masters
 decision
 even
 after
 her
 accusers
 had
 gone
 Jesus
 did
 not
 expressly
 condone
 He
 declined
 to
 condemn
 but
 He
 sent
 the
 sinner
 away
 with
 a
 solemn
 adjuration
 to
 a
 better
 life
 THE
 LIGHT
 OF
 THE
 WORLD
 Sitting
 within
 the
 temple
 enclosure
 in
 the
 division
 known
 as
 the
 Treasury
 which
 was
 connected
 with
 the
 Court
 of
 the
 Women
 our
 Lord
 continued
 His
 teaching
 saying
 I
 am
 the
 light
 of
 the
 world
 he
 that
 followeth
 me
 shall
 not
 walk
 in
 darkness
 but
 shall
 have
 the
 light
 of
 life
 The
 great
 lamps
 set
 up
 in
 the
 court
 as
 a
 feature
 of
 the
 joyful
 celebration
 just
 ended
 gave
 point
 to
 our
 Lords
 avowal
 of
 Himself
 as
 the
 Light
 of
 the
 World
 It
 was
 another
 proclamation
 of
 His
 divinity
 as
 God
 and
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 The
 Pharisees
 challenged
 His
 testimony
 declaring
 it
 of
 no
 worth
 because
 He
 bore
 record
 of
 Himself
 Jesus
 admitted
 that
 He
 testified
 of
 Himself
 but
 affirmed
 nevertheless
 that
 what
 He
 said
 was
 true
 for
 He
 knew
 whereof
 He
 spoke
 whence
 He
 came
 and
 whither
 He
 would
 go
 while
 they
 spoke
 in
 ignorance
 They
 thought
 talked
 and
 judged
 after
 the
 ways
 of
 men
 and
 the
 frailties
 of
 the
 flesh
 He
 was
 not
 sitting
 in
 judgment
 but
 should
 He
 choose
 to
 judge
 then
 His
 judgment
 would
 be
 just
 for
 He
 was
 guided
 by
 the
 Father
 who
 sent
 Him
 Their
 law
 required
 the
 testimony
 of
 two
 witnesses
 for
 the
 legal
 determination
 of
 any
 question
 of
 fact
 and
 Jesus
 cited
 Himself
 and
 His
 Father
 as
 witnesses
 in
 support
 of
 His
 affirmation
 His
 opponents
 then
 asked
 with
 contemptuous
 or
 sarcastic
 intent
 Where
 is
 thy
 Father
 The
 reply
 was
 in
 lofty
 tone
 Ye
 neither
 know
 me
 nor
 my
 Father
 if
 ye
 had
 known
 me
 ye
 should
 have
 known
 my
 Father
 also
 Enraged
 at
 their
 own
 discomfiture
 the
 Pharisees
 would
 have
 seized
 Him
 but
 found
 themselves
 impotent
 No
 man
 laid
 hands
 on
 him
 for
 his
 hour
 was
 not
 yet
 come
 THE
 TRUTH
 SHALL
 MAKE
 YOU
 FREE
 Again
 addressing
 the
 mixed
 assemblage
 which
 probably
 comprized
 Pharisees
 scribes
 rabbis
 priests
 Levites
 and
 lay
 people
 Jesus
 repeated
 His
 former
 assertion
 that
 soon
 He
 would
 leave
 them
 and
 that
 whither
 He
 went
 they
 could
 not
 follow
 and
 added
 the
 fateful
 assurance
 that
 they
 would
 seek
 Him
 in
 vain
 and
 would
 die
 in
 their
 sins
 His
 solemn
 portent
 was
 treated
 with
 light
 concern
 if
 not
 contempt
 Some
 of
 them
 asked
 querulously
 Will
 he
 kill
 himself
 the
 implication
 being
 that
 in
 such
 case
 they
 surely
 would
 not
 follow
 Him
 for
 according
 to
 their
 dogma
 Gehenna
 was
 the
 place
 of
 suicides
 and
 they
 being
 of
 the
 chosen
 people
 were
 bound
 for
 heaven
 not
 hell
 The
 Lords
 dignified
 rejoinder
 was
 Ye
 are
 from
 beneath
 I
 am
 from
 above
 ye
 are
 of
 this
 world
 I
 am
 not
 of
 this
 world
 I
 said
 therefore
 unto
 you
 that
 ye
 shall
 die
 in
 your
 sins
 for
 if
 ye
 believe
 not
 that
 I
 am
 he
 ye
 shall
 die
 in
 your
 sins
 This
 reiteration
 of
 His
 distinctive
 supremacy
 brought
 forth
 the
 challenging
 question
 Who
 art
 thou
 Jesus
 replied
 Even
 the
 same
 that
 I
 said
 unto
 you
 from
 the
 beginning
 The
 many
 matters
 on
 which
 He
 might
 have
 judged
 them
 He
 refrained
 from
 mentioning
 but
 testified
 anew
 of
 the
 Father
 saying
 He
 that
 sent
 me
 is
 true
 and
 I
 speak
 to
 the
 world
 those
 things
 which
 I
 have
 heard
 of
 him
 Explicit
 as
 His
 earlier
 explanations
 had
 been
 the
 Jews
 in
 their
 gross
 prejudice
 understood
 not
 that
 he
 spake
 to
 them
 of
 the
 Father
 To
 His
 Father
 Jesus
 ascribed
 all
 honor
 and
 glory
 and
 repeatedly
 declared
 Himself
 as
 sent
 to
 do
 the
 Fathers
 will
 Then
 said
 Jesus
 unto
 them
 When
 ye
 have
 lifted
 up
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 then
 shall
 ye
 know
 that
 I
 am
 he
 and
 that
 I
 do
 nothing
 of
 myself
 but
 as
 my
 Father
 hath
 taught
 me
 I
 speak
 these
 things
 And
 he
 that
 sent
 me
 is
 with
 me
 the
 Father
 hath
 not
 left
 me
 alone
 for
 I
 do
 always
 those
 things
 that
 please
 him
 The
 evident
 earnestness
 and
 profound
 conviction
 with
 which
 Jesus
 spoke
 caused
 many
 of
 His
 hearers
 to
 believe
 on
 Him
 and
 these
 He
 addressed
 with
 the
 promise
 that
 if
 they
 continued
 in
 that
 belief
 and
 shaped
 their
 lives
 according
 to
 His
 word
 they
 should
 be
 His
 disciples
 indeed
 A
 further
 promise
 followed
 And
 ye
 shall
 know
 the
 truth
 and
 the
 truth
 shall
 make
 you
 free
 At
 these
 words
 so
 rich
 in
 blessing
 so
 full
 of
 comfort
 for
 the
 believing
 soul
 the
 people
 were
 stirred
 to
 angry
 demonstrations
 their
 Jewish
 temper
 was
 immediately
 ablaze
 To
 promise
 them
 freedom
 was
 to
 imply
 that
 they
 were
 not
 already
 free
 We
 be
 Abrahams
 seed
 and
 were
 never
 in
 bondage
 to
 any
 man
 how
 sayest
 thou
 Ye
 shall
 be
 made
 free
 In
 their
 unbridled
 fanaticism
 they
 had
 forgotten
 the
 bondage
 of
 Egypt
 the
 captivity
 of
 Babylon
 and
 were
 oblivious
 of
 their
 existing
 state
 of
 vassalage
 to
 Rome
 To
 say
 that
 Israel
 had
 never
 been
 in
 bondage
 was
 not
 only
 to
 convict
 themselves
 of
 falsehood
 but
 to
 stultify
 themselves
 wretchedly
 Jesus
 made
 it
 clear
 that
 He
 had
 not
 referred
 to
 freedom
 in
 its
 physical
 or
 political
 sense
 alone
 though
 to
 this
 conception
 their
 false
 disavowal
 had
 been
 directed
 the
 liberty
 He
 proclaimed
 was
 spiritual
 liberty
 the
 grievous
 bondage
 from
 which
 He
 would
 deliver
 them
 was
 the
 serfdom
 of
 sin
 To
 their
 vaunted
 boast
 that
 they
 were
 free
 men
 not
 slaves
 He
 replied
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Whosoever
 committeth
 sin
 is
 the
 servant
 of
 sin
 As
 a
 sinner
 every
 one
 of
 them
 was
 in
 slavery
 A
 bondservant
 Jesus
 reminded
 them
 was
 allowed
 in
 the
 masters
 house
 by
 sufferance
 only
 it
 was
 not
 his
 inherent
 right
 to
 remain
 there
 his
 owner
 could
 send
 him
 away
 at
 any
 time
 and
 might
 even
 sell
 him
 to
 another
 but
 a
 son
 of
 the
 family
 had
 of
 his
 own
 right
 a
 place
 in
 his
 fathers
 home
 Now
 if
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 made
 them
 free
 they
 would
 be
 free
 indeed
 Though
 they
 were
 of
 Abrahamic
 lineage
 in
 the
 flesh
 they
 were
 no
 heirs
 of
 Abraham
 in
 spirit
 or
 works
 Our
 Lords
 mention
 of
 His
 Father
 as
 distinct
 from
 their
 father
 drew
 forth
 the
 angry
 reiteration
 Abraham
 is
 our
 father
 to
 which
 Jesus
 replied
 If
 ye
 were
 Abrahams
 children
 ye
 would
 do
 the
 works
 of
 Abraham
 But
 now
 ye
 seek
 to
 kill
 me
 a
 man
 that
 hath
 told
 you
 the
 truth
 which
 I
 have
 heard
 of
 God
 this
 did
 not
 Abraham
 Ye
 do
 the
 deeds
 of
 your
 father
 In
 their
 blind
 anger
 they
 apparently
 construed
 this
 to
 imply
 that
 though
 they
 were
 children
 of
 Abrahams
 household
 some
 other
 man
 than
 Abraham
 was
 their
 actual
 progenitor
 or
 that
 they
 were
 not
 of
 unmixed
 Israelitish
 blood
 We
 be
 not
 born
 of
 fornication
 they
 cried
 we
 have
 one
 Father
 even
 God
 Jesus
 said
 unto
 them
 If
 God
 were
 your
 Father
 ye
 would
 love
 me
 for
 I
 proceeded
 forth
 and
 came
 from
 God
 neither
 came
 I
 of
 myself
 but
 he
 sent
 me
 They
 failed
 to
 understand
 because
 of
 their
 stubborn
 refusal
 to
 listen
 dispassionately
 With
 forceful
 accusation
 Jesus
 told
 them
 whose
 children
 they
 actually
 were
 as
 evinced
 by
 the
 hereditary
 traits
 manifest
 in
 their
 lives
 Ye
 are
 of
 your
 father
 the
 devil
 and
 the
 lusts
 of
 your
 father
 ye
 will
 do
 He
 was
 a
 murderer
 from
 the
 beginning
 and
 abode
 not
 in
 the
 truth
 because
 there
 is
 no
 truth
 in
 him
 When
 he
 speaketh
 a
 lie
 he
 speaketh
 of
 his
 own
 for
 he
 is
 a
 liar
 and
 the
 father
 of
 it
 And
 because
 I
 tell
 you
 the
 truth
 ye
 believe
 me
 not
 He
 challenged
 them
 to
 find
 sin
 in
 Him
 and
 then
 asked
 why
 if
 He
 spake
 the
 truth
 they
 so
 persistently
 refused
 to
 believe
 Him
 Answering
 His
 own
 question
 He
 told
 them
 that
 they
 were
 not
 of
 God
 and
 therefore
 they
 understood
 not
 the
 words
 of
 God
 The
 Master
 was
 unimpeachable
 His
 terse
 cogent
 assertions
 were
 unanswerable
 In
 impotent
 rage
 the
 discomfited
 Jews
 resorted
 to
 invective
 and
 calumny
 Say
 we
 not
 well
 that
 thou
 art
 a
 Samaritan
 and
 hast
 a
 devil
 they
 shrieked
 They
 had
 before
 called
 Him
 a
 Galilean
 that
 appellative
 was
 but
 mildly
 depreciatory
 and
 moreover
 was
 a
 truthful
 designation
 according
 to
 their
 knowledge
 but
 the
 epithet
 Samaritan
 was
 inspired
 by
 hate
 and
 by
 its
 application
 they
 meant
 to
 disown
 Him
 as
 a
 Jew
 The
 charge
 that
 He
 was
 a
 demoniac
 was
 but
 a
 repetition
 of
 earlier
 slanders
 Jesus
 answered
 I
 have
 not
 a
 devil
 but
 I
 honour
 my
 Father
 and
 ye
 do
 dishonour
 me
 Reverting
 to
 the
 eternal
 riches
 offered
 by
 His
 gospel
 the
 Master
 said
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 If
 a
 man
 keep
 my
 saying
 he
 shall
 never
 see
 death
 This
 rendered
 them
 the
 more
 infuriate
 Now
 we
 know
 that
 thou
 hast
 a
 devil
 they
 cried
 and
 as
 evidence
 of
 what
 they
 professed
 to
 regard
 as
 His
 insanity
 they
 cited
 the
 fact
 that
 great
 as
 were
 Abraham
 and
 the
 prophets
 they
 were
 dead
 yet
 Jesus
 dared
 to
 say
 that
 all
 who
 kept
 His
 sayings
 should
 be
 exempt
 from
 death
 Did
 He
 pretend
 to
 exalt
 Himself
 above
 Abraham
 and
 the
 prophets
 Whom
 makest
 thou
 thyself
 they
 demanded
 The
 Lords
 reply
 was
 a
 disclaimer
 of
 all
 selfaggrandizement
 His
 honor
 was
 not
 of
 His
 own
 seeking
 but
 was
 the
 gift
 of
 His
 Father
 whom
 He
 knew
 and
 were
 He
 to
 deny
 that
 He
 knew
 the
 Father
 He
 would
 be
 a
 liar
 like
 unto
 themselves
 Touching
 the
 relationship
 between
 Himself
 and
 the
 great
 patriarch
 of
 their
 race
 Jesus
 thus
 affirmed
 and
 emphasized
 His
 own
 supremacy
 Your
 father
 Abraham
 rejoiced
 to
 see
 my
 day
 and
 he
 saw
 it
 and
 was
 glad
 Not
 only
 angered
 but
 puzzled
 the
 Jews
 demanded
 further
 explanation
 Construing
 the
 last
 declaration
 as
 applying
 to
 the
 mortal
 state
 only
 they
 said
 Thou
 art
 not
 yet
 fifty
 years
 old
 and
 hast
 thou
 seen
 Abraham
 Jesus
 answered
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Before
 Abraham
 was
 I
 am
 This
 was
 an
 unequivocal
 and
 unambiguous
 declaration
 of
 our
 Lords
 eternal
 Godship
 By
 the
 awful
 title
 I
 AM
 He
 had
 made
 Himself
 known
 to
 Moses
 and
 thereafter
 was
 so
 known
 in
 Israel
 As
 already
 shown
 it
 is
 the
 equivalent
 of
 Yahveh
 or
 Jahveh
 now
 rendered
 Jehovah
 and
 signifies
 The
 Selfexistent
 One
 The
 Eternal
 The
 First
 and
 the
 Last
 Jewish
 traditionalism
 forbade
 the
 utterance
 of
 the
 sacred
 Name
 yet
 Jesus
 claimed
 it
 as
 His
 own
 In
 an
 orgy
 of
 selfrighteous
 indignation
 the
 Jews
 seized
 upon
 the
 stones
 that
 lay
 in
 the
 unfinished
 courts
 and
 would
 have
 crushed
 their
 Lord
 but
 the
 hour
 of
 His
 death
 had
 not
 yet
 come
 and
 unseen
 of
 them
 He
 passed
 through
 the
 crowd
 and
 departed
 from
 the
 temple
 His
 seniority
 to
 Abraham
 plainly
 referred
 to
 the
 status
 of
 each
 in
 the
 antemortal
 or
 preexistent
 state
 Jesus
 was
 as
 literally
 the
 Firstborn
 in
 the
 spiritworld
 as
 He
 was
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 in
 the
 flesh
 Christ
 is
 as
 truly
 the
 Elder
 Brother
 of
 Abraham
 and
 Adam
 as
 of
 the
 lastborn
 child
 of
 earth
 BODILY
 AND
 SPIRITUAL
 BLINDNESSSIGHT
 GIVEN
 TO
 A
 MAN
 ON
 THE
 SABBATH
 At
 Jerusalem
 Jesus
 mercifully
 gave
 sight
 to
 a
 man
 who
 had
 been
 blind
 from
 his
 birth
 The
 miracle
 is
 an
 instance
 of
 Sabbathday
 healing
 of
 more
 than
 ordinary
 interest
 because
 of
 its
 attendant
 incidents
 It
 is
 recorded
 by
 John
 alone
 and
 as
 usual
 with
 that
 writer
 his
 narrative
 is
 given
 with
 descriptive
 detail
 Jesus
 and
 His
 disciples
 saw
 the
 sightless
 one
 upon
 the
 street
 The
 poor
 man
 lived
 by
 begging
 The
 disciples
 eager
 to
 learn
 asked
 Master
 who
 did
 sin
 this
 man
 or
 his
 parents
 that
 he
 was
 born
 blind
 The
 Lords
 reply
 was
 Neither
 hath
 this
 man
 sinned
 nor
 his
 parents
 but
 that
 the
 works
 of
 God
 should
 be
 made
 manifest
 in
 him
 The
 disciples
 question
 implied
 their
 belief
 in
 a
 state
 of
 moral
 agency
 and
 choice
 antedating
 mortality
 else
 how
 could
 they
 have
 thought
 of
 the
 man
 having
 sinned
 so
 as
 to
 bring
 upon
 himself
 congenital
 blindness
 We
 are
 expressly
 told
 that
 he
 was
 born
 blind
 That
 he
 might
 have
 been
 a
 sufferer
 from
 the
 sins
 of
 his
 parents
 was
 conceivable
 The
 disciples
 evidently
 had
 been
 taught
 the
 great
 truth
 of
 an
 antemortal
 existence
 It
 is
 further
 to
 be
 seen
 that
 they
 looked
 upon
 bodily
 affliction
 as
 the
 result
 of
 personal
 sin
 Their
 generalization
 was
 too
 broad
 for
 while
 as
 shown
 by
 instances
 heretofore
 cited
 individual
 wickedness
 may
 and
 does
 bring
 physical
 ills
 in
 its
 train
 man
 is
 liable
 to
 err
 in
 his
 judgment
 as
 to
 the
 ultimate
 cause
 of
 affliction
 The
 Lords
 reply
 was
 sufficing
 the
 mans
 blindness
 would
 be
 turned
 to
 account
 in
 bringing
 about
 a
 manifestation
 of
 divine
 power
 As
 Jesus
 explained
 respecting
 His
 own
 ministry
 it
 was
 necessary
 that
 He
 do
 the
 Fathers
 work
 in
 the
 season
 appointed
 for
 His
 time
 was
 short
 With
 impressive
 pertinency
 as
 relating
 to
 the
 state
 of
 the
 man
 who
 had
 been
 in
 darkness
 all
 his
 days
 our
 Lord
 repeated
 the
 affirmation
 before
 made
 in
 the
 temple
 I
 am
 the
 light
 of
 the
 world
 The
 outward
 ministration
 to
 the
 blind
 man
 was
 different
 from
 the
 usual
 course
 followed
 by
 Jesus
 He
 spat
 on
 the
 ground
 and
 made
 clay
 of
 the
 spittle
 and
 he
 anointed
 the
 eyes
 of
 the
 blind
 man
 with
 the
 clay
 and
 then
 directed
 him
 to
 go
 to
 the
 pool
 of
 Siloam
 and
 wash
 in
 its
 waters
 The
 man
 went
 washed
 and
 came
 seeing
 He
 was
 evidently
 a
 wellknown
 character
 many
 had
 seen
 him
 in
 his
 accustomed
 place
 begging
 alms
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 had
 been
 blind
 from
 birth
 was
 also
 of
 common
 knowledge
 When
 therefore
 it
 was
 noised
 about
 that
 he
 could
 see
 there
 was
 much
 excitement
 and
 comment
 Some
 doubted
 that
 the
 man
 they
 questioned
 was
 the
 once
 sightless
 beggar
 but
 he
 assured
 them
 of
 his
 identity
 and
 told
 how
 he
 had
 been
 made
 to
 see
 They
 brought
 the
 man
 to
 the
 Pharisees
 who
 questioned
 him
 rigorously
 and
 having
 heard
 his
 account
 of
 the
 miracle
 tried
 to
 undermine
 his
 faith
 by
 telling
 him
 that
 Jesus
 who
 had
 healed
 him
 could
 not
 be
 a
 man
 of
 God
 since
 He
 had
 done
 the
 deed
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 Some
 of
 those
 who
 heard
 demurred
 to
 the
 Pharisaic
 deduction
 and
 asked
 How
 can
 a
 man
 that
 is
 a
 sinner
 do
 such
 miracles
 The
 man
 was
 questioned
 as
 to
 his
 personal
 opinion
 of
 Jesus
 and
 promptly
 answered
 He
 is
 a
 prophet
 The
 man
 knew
 his
 Benefactor
 to
 be
 more
 than
 any
 ordinary
 being
 as
 yet
 however
 he
 had
 no
 knowledge
 of
 Him
 as
 the
 Christ
 The
 inquisitorial
 Jews
 were
 afraid
 of
 the
 result
 of
 such
 a
 wondrous
 healing
 in
 that
 the
 people
 would
 support
 Jesus
 whom
 the
 rulers
 were
 determined
 to
 destroy
 They
 assumed
 it
 to
 be
 possible
 that
 the
 man
 had
 not
 been
 really
 blind
 so
 they
 summoned
 his
 parents
 who
 answered
 their
 interrogatories
 by
 affirming
 that
 he
 was
 their
 son
 and
 they
 knew
 him
 to
 have
 been
 born
 blind
 but
 as
 to
 how
 he
 had
 received
 sight
 or
 through
 whose
 ministration
 they
 refused
 to
 commit
 themselves
 knowing
 the
 rulers
 had
 decreed
 that
 any
 one
 who
 confessed
 Jesus
 to
 be
 the
 Christ
 should
 be
 cast
 out
 from
 the
 community
 of
 the
 synagog
 or
 as
 we
 would
 say
 today
 excommunicated
 from
 the
 Church
 With
 pardonable
 astuteness
 the
 parents
 said
 of
 their
 son
 He
 is
 of
 age
 ask
 him
 he
 shall
 speak
 for
 himself
 Compelled
 to
 acknowledge
 to
 themselves
 at
 least
 that
 the
 fact
 and
 the
 manner
 of
 the
 mans
 restoration
 to
 sight
 were
 supported
 by
 irrefutable
 evidence
 the
 crafty
 Jews
 called
 the
 man
 again
 and
 insinuatingly
 said
 unto
 him
 Give
 God
 the
 praise
 we
 know
 that
 this
 man
 is
 a
 sinner
 He
 replied
 fearlessly
 and
 with
 such
 pertinent
 logic
 as
 to
 completely
 offset
 their
 skill
 as
 crossexaminers
 Whether
 he
 be
 a
 sinner
 or
 no
 I
 know
 not
 one
 thing
 I
 know
 that
 whereas
 I
 was
 blind
 now
 I
 see
 He
 very
 properly
 declined
 to
 enter
 into
 a
 discussion
 with
 his
 learned
 questioners
 as
 to
 what
 constituted
 sin
 under
 their
 construction
 of
 the
 law
 of
 what
 he
 was
 ignorant
 he
 declined
 to
 speak
 but
 on
 one
 matter
 he
 was
 happily
 and
 gratefully
 certain
 that
 whereas
 he
 had
 been
 blind
 now
 he
 could
 see
 The
 Pharisaical
 inquisitors
 next
 tried
 to
 get
 the
 man
 to
 repeat
 his
 story
 of
 the
 means
 employed
 in
 the
 healing
 probably
 with
 the
 subtle
 purpose
 of
 leading
 him
 into
 inconsistent
 or
 contradictory
 statements
 but
 he
 replied
 with
 emphasis
 and
 possibly
 with
 some
 show
 of
 impatience
 I
 have
 told
 you
 already
 and
 ye
 did
 not
 hear
 wherefore
 would
 ye
 hear
 it
 again
 will
 ye
 also
 be
 his
 disciples
 They
 retorted
 with
 anger
 and
 reviled
 the
 man
 the
 ironical
 insinuation
 that
 they
 perchance
 wished
 to
 become
 disciples
 of
 Jesus
 was
 an
 insult
 they
 would
 not
 brook
 Thou
 art
 his
 disciple
 said
 they
 but
 we
 are
 Moses
 disciples
 We
 know
 that
 God
 spake
 unto
 Moses
 as
 for
 this
 fellow
 we
 know
 not
 from
 whence
 he
 is
 They
 were
 enraged
 that
 this
 unlettered
 mendicant
 should
 answer
 so
 boldly
 in
 their
 scholarly
 presence
 but
 the
 man
 was
 more
 than
 a
 match
 for
 all
 of
 them
 His
 rejoinder
 was
 maddening
 because
 it
 flouted
 their
 vaunted
 wisdom
 and
 withal
 was
 unanswerable
 Why
 herein
 is
 a
 marvellous
 thing
 said
 he
 that
 ye
 know
 not
 from
 whence
 he
 is
 and
 yet
 he
 hath
 opened
 mine
 eyes
 Now
 we
 know
 that
 God
 heareth
 not
 sinners
 but
 if
 any
 man
 be
 a
 worshipper
 of
 God
 and
 doeth
 his
 will
 him
 he
 heareth
 Since
 the
 world
 began
 was
 it
 not
 heard
 that
 any
 man
 opened
 the
 eyes
 of
 one
 that
 was
 born
 blind
 If
 this
 man
 were
 not
 of
 God
 he
 could
 do
 nothing
 For
 such
 an
 affront
 from
 a
 layman
 there
 was
 no
 precedent
 in
 all
 the
 lore
 of
 rabbis
 or
 scribes
 Thou
 wast
 altogether
 born
 in
 sins
 and
 dost
 thou
 teach
 us
 was
 their
 denunciatory
 though
 weak
 and
 inadequate
 rejoinder
 Unable
 to
 cope
 with
 the
 sometime
 sightless
 beggar
 in
 argument
 or
 demonstration
 they
 could
 at
 least
 exercize
 their
 official
 authority
 however
 unjustly
 by
 excommunicating
 him
 and
 this
 they
 promptly
 did
 Jesus
 heard
 that
 they
 had
 cast
 him
 out
 and
 when
 he
 had
 found
 him
 he
 said
 unto
 him
 Dost
 thou
 believe
 on
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 he
 answered
 and
 said
 Who
 is
 he
 Lord
 that
 I
 might
 believe
 on
 him
 And
 Jesus
 said
 unto
 him
 Thou
 hast
 both
 seen
 him
 and
 it
 is
 he
 that
 talketh
 with
 thee
 And
 he
 said
 Lord
 I
 believe
 And
 he
 worshipped
 him
 In
 commenting
 upon
 the
 matter
 Jesus
 was
 heard
 to
 say
 that
 one
 purpose
 of
 His
 coming
 into
 the
 world
 was
 that
 they
 which
 see
 not
 might
 see
 and
 that
 they
 which
 see
 might
 be
 made
 blind
 Some
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 caught
 the
 remark
 and
 asked
 in
 pride
 Are
 we
 blind
 also
 The
 Lords
 reply
 was
 a
 condemnation
 If
 ye
 were
 blind
 ye
 should
 have
 no
 sin
 but
 now
 ye
 say
 We
 see
 therefore
 your
 sin
 remaineth
 SHEPHERD
 AND
 SHEEPHERDER
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 He
 that
 entereth
 not
 by
 the
 door
 into
 the
 sheep
 fold
 but
 climbeth
 up
 some
 other
 way
 the
 same
 is
 a
 thief
 and
 a
 robber
 But
 he
 that
 entereth
 in
 by
 the
 door
 is
 the
 shepherd
 of
 the
 sheep
 With
 these
 words
 Jesus
 prefaced
 one
 of
 His
 most
 impressive
 discourses
 The
 mention
 of
 shepherd
 and
 sheep
 must
 have
 brought
 to
 the
 minds
 of
 His
 hearers
 many
 of
 the
 oftquoted
 passages
 from
 prophets
 and
 psalms
 The
 figure
 is
 an
 effective
 one
 and
 all
 the
 more
 so
 when
 we
 consider
 the
 circumstances
 under
 which
 it
 was
 used
 by
 the
 Master
 Pastoral
 conditions
 prevailed
 in
 Palestine
 and
 the
 dignity
 of
 the
 shepherds
 vocation
 was
 very
 generally
 recognized
 By
 specific
 prophecy
 a
 Shepherd
 had
 been
 promised
 to
 Israel
 David
 the
 king
 of
 whom
 all
 Israelites
 were
 proud
 had
 been
 taken
 directly
 from
 the
 sheepfold
 and
 had
 come
 with
 a
 shepherds
 crook
 in
 his
 hand
 to
 the
 anointing
 that
 made
 him
 royal
 As
 the
 Teacher
 showed
 a
 shepherd
 has
 free
 access
 to
 the
 sheep
 When
 they
 are
 folded
 within
 the
 enclosure
 of
 safety
 he
 enters
 at
 the
 gate
 he
 neither
 climbs
 over
 nor
 creeps
 in
 He
 the
 owner
 of
 the
 sheep
 loves
 them
 they
 know
 his
 voice
 and
 follow
 him
 as
 he
 leads
 from
 fold
 to
 pasture
 for
 he
 goes
 before
 the
 flock
 while
 the
 stranger
 though
 he
 be
 the
 herder
 they
 know
 not
 he
 must
 needs
 drive
 for
 he
 cannot
 lead
 Continuing
 the
 allegory
 which
 the
 recorder
 speaks
 of
 as
 a
 parable
 Jesus
 designated
 Himself
 as
 the
 door
 to
 the
 sheepfold
 and
 made
 plain
 that
 only
 through
 Him
 could
 the
 undershepherds
 rightly
 enter
 True
 there
 were
 some
 who
 sought
 by
 avoiding
 the
 portal
 and
 climbing
 over
 the
 fence
 to
 reach
 the
 folded
 flock
 but
 these
 were
 robbers
 trying
 to
 get
 at
 the
 sheep
 as
 prey
 their
 selfish
 and
 malignant
 purpose
 was
 to
 kill
 and
 carry
 off
 Changing
 the
 figure
 Christ
 proclaimed
 I
 am
 the
 good
 shepherd
 He
 then
 further
 showed
 and
 with
 eloquent
 exactness
 the
 difference
 between
 a
 shepherd
 and
 a
 hireling
 herder
 The
 one
 has
 personal
 interest
 in
 and
 love
 for
 his
 flock
 and
 knows
 each
 sheep
 by
 name
 the
 other
 knows
 them
 only
 as
 a
 flock
 the
 value
 of
 which
 is
 gaged
 by
 number
 to
 the
 hireling
 they
 are
 only
 as
 so
 many
 or
 so
 much
 While
 the
 shepherd
 is
 ready
 to
 fight
 in
 defense
 of
 his
 own
 and
 if
 necessary
 even
 imperil
 his
 life
 for
 his
 sheep
 the
 hireling
 flees
 when
 the
 wolf
 approaches
 leaving
 the
 way
 open
 for
 the
 ravening
 beast
 to
 scatter
 rend
 and
 kill
 Never
 has
 been
 written
 or
 spoken
 a
 stronger
 arraignment
 of
 false
 pastors
 unauthorized
 teachers
 selfseeking
 hirelings
 who
 teach
 for
 pelf
 and
 divine
 for
 dollars
 deceivers
 who
 pose
 as
 shepherds
 yet
 avoid
 the
 door
 and
 climb
 over
 some
 other
 way
 prophets
 in
 the
 devils
 employ
 who
 to
 achieve
 their
 masters
 purpose
 hesitate
 not
 to
 robe
 themselves
 in
 the
 garments
 of
 assumed
 sanctity
 and
 appear
 in
 sheeps
 clothing
 while
 inwardly
 they
 are
 ravening
 wolves
 With
 effective
 repetition
 Jesus
 continued
 I
 am
 the
 good
 shepherd
 and
 know
 my
 sheep
 and
 am
 known
 of
 mine
 As
 the
 Father
 knoweth
 me
 even
 so
 know
 I
 the
 Father
 and
 I
 lay
 down
 my
 life
 for
 the
 sheep
 For
 this
 cause
 was
 Jesus
 the
 Fathers
 Beloved
 Sonthat
 He
 was
 ready
 to
 lay
 down
 His
 life
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 the
 sheep
 That
 the
 sacrifice
 He
 was
 soon
 to
 render
 was
 in
 fact
 voluntary
 and
 not
 a
 forfeiture
 under
 compulsion
 is
 solemnly
 affirmed
 in
 the
 Saviors
 words
 Therefore
 doth
 my
 Father
 love
 me
 because
 I
 lay
 down
 my
 life
 that
 I
 might
 take
 it
 again
 No
 man
 taketh
 it
 from
 me
 but
 I
 lay
 it
 down
 of
 myself
 I
 have
 power
 to
 lay
 it
 down
 and
 I
 have
 power
 to
 take
 it
 again
 This
 commandment
 have
 I
 received
 of
 my
 Father
 The
 certainty
 of
 His
 death
 and
 of
 His
 subsequent
 resurrection
 are
 here
 reiterated
 A
 natural
 effect
 of
 His
 immortal
 origin
 as
 the
 earthborn
 Son
 of
 an
 immortal
 Sire
 was
 that
 He
 was
 immune
 to
 death
 except
 as
 He
 surrendered
 thereto
 The
 life
 of
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 could
 not
 be
 taken
 save
 as
 He
 willed
 and
 allowed
 The
 power
 to
 lay
 down
 His
 life
 was
 inherent
 in
 Himself
 as
 was
 the
 power
 to
 take
 up
 His
 slain
 body
 in
 an
 immortalized
 state
 These
 teachings
 caused
 further
 division
 among
 the
 Jews
 Some
 pretended
 to
 dispose
 of
 the
 matter
 by
 voicing
 anew
 the
 foolish
 assumption
 that
 Jesus
 was
 but
 an
 insane
 demoniac
 and
 that
 therefore
 His
 words
 were
 not
 worthy
 of
 attention
 Others
 with
 consistency
 said
 These
 are
 not
 the
 words
 of
 him
 that
 hath
 a
 devil
 Can
 a
 devil
 open
 the
 eyes
 of
 the
 blind
 So
 it
 was
 that
 a
 few
 believed
 many
 doubted
 though
 partly
 convinced
 and
 some
 condemned
 As
 part
 of
 this
 profound
 discourse
 Jesus
 said
 And
 other
 sheep
 I
 have
 which
 are
 not
 of
 this
 fold
 them
 also
 I
 must
 bring
 and
 they
 shall
 hear
 my
 voice
 and
 there
 shall
 be
 one
 fold
 and
 one
 shepherd
 The
 other
 sheep
 here
 referred
 to
 constituted
 the
 separated
 flock
 or
 remnant
 of
 the
 house
 of
 Joseph
 who
 six
 centuries
 prior
 to
 the
 birth
 of
 Christ
 had
 been
 miraculously
 detached
 from
 the
 Jewish
 fold
 in
 Palestine
 and
 had
 been
 taken
 beyond
 the
 great
 deep
 to
 the
 American
 continent
 When
 to
 them
 the
 resurrected
 Christ
 appeared
 He
 thus
 spake
 And
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 that
 ye
 are
 they
 of
 whom
 I
 said
 other
 sheep
 I
 have
 which
 are
 not
 of
 this
 fold
 them
 also
 I
 must
 bring
 and
 they
 shall
 hear
 my
 voice
 and
 there
 shall
 be
 one
 fold
 and
 one
 shepherd
 The
 Jews
 had
 vaguely
 understood
 Christs
 reference
 to
 other
 sheep
 as
 meaning
 in
 some
 obscure
 way
 the
 Gentile
 nations
 and
 because
 of
 their
 unbelief
 and
 consequent
 inability
 to
 rightly
 comprehend
 Jesus
 had
 withheld
 any
 plainer
 exposition
 of
 His
 meaning
 for
 so
 He
 informed
 the
 Nephites
 had
 the
 Father
 directed
 This
 much
 did
 the
 Father
 command
 me
 He
 explained
 that
 I
 should
 tell
 unto
 them
 That
 other
 sheep
 I
 have
 which
 are
 not
 of
 this
 fold
 them
 also
 I
 must
 bring
 and
 they
 shall
 hear
 my
 voice
 and
 there
 shall
 be
 one
 fold
 and
 one
 shepherd
 On
 the
 same
 occasion
 the
 Lord
 declared
 that
 there
 were
 yet
 other
 sheep
 those
 of
 the
 Lost
 or
 Ten
 Tribes
 to
 whom
 He
 was
 then
 about
 to
 go
 and
 who
 would
 eventually
 be
 brought
 forth
 from
 their
 place
 of
 exile
 and
 become
 part
 of
 the
 one
 blessed
 fold
 under
 the
 governance
 of
 the
 one
 supreme
 Shepherd
 and
 King

 CHAPTER
 
 
 The
 Feast
 of
 TabernaclesIn
 the
 order
 of
 yearly
 occurrence
 this
 was
 the
 third
 of
 the
 great
 festivals
 the
 observance
 of
 which
 was
 among
 the
 national
 characteristics
 of
 the
 people
 of
 Israel
 the
 others
 were
 the
 Passover
 and
 the
 feast
 of
 Weeks
 or
 Pentecost
 at
 each
 of
 the
 three
 all
 the
 males
 in
 Israel
 were
 required
 to
 appear
 before
 the
 Lord
 in
 formal
 celebration
 of
 the
 respective
 feast
 Exo
 
 The
 feast
 of
 Tabernacles
 was
 also
 known
 as
 the
 feast
 of
 ingathering
 Exo
 
 it
 was
 both
 a
 memorial
 and
 a
 current
 harvest
 celebration
 In
 commemoration
 of
 their
 long
 journeying
 in
 the
 wilderness
 following
 their
 deliverance
 from
 Egypt
 in
 the
 course
 of
 which
 journey
 they
 had
 to
 live
 in
 tents
 and
 improvized
 booths
 the
 people
 of
 Israel
 were
 required
 to
 observe
 annually
 a
 festival
 lasting
 seven
 days
 with
 an
 added
 day
 of
 holy
 convocation
 During
 the
 week
 the
 people
 lived
 in
 booths
 bowers
 or
 tabernacles
 made
 of
 the
 branches
 or
 boughs
 of
 goodly
 trees
 wattled
 with
 willows
 from
 the
 brook
 Lev
 
 Numb
 
 Deut
 
 
 The
 festival
 lasted
 from
 the
 th
 to
 the
 d
 of
 the
 month
 Tizri
 the
 seventh
 in
 the
 Hebrew
 calendar
 corresponding
 to
 parts
 of
 our
 September
 and
 October
 It
 was
 made
 to
 follow
 soon
 after
 the
 annual
 Day
 of
 Atonement
 which
 was
 a
 time
 of
 penitence
 and
 affliction
 of
 the
 soul
 in
 sorrow
 for
 sin
 Lev
 
 The
 altar
 sacrifices
 at
 the
 feast
 of
 Tabernacles
 exceeded
 those
 prescribed
 for
 other
 festivals
 and
 comprized
 a
 daily
 offering
 of
 two
 rams
 fourteen
 lambs
 and
 a
 kid
 as
 a
 sin
 offering
 and
 in
 addition
 a
 varying
 number
 of
 young
 bullocks
 thirteen
 of
 which
 were
 sacrificed
 on
 the
 first
 day
 twelve
 on
 the
 second
 eleven
 on
 the
 third
 and
 so
 on
 to
 the
 seventh
 day
 on
 which
 seven
 were
 offered
 making
 in
 all
 seventy
 bullocks
 Numb
 
 Rabbinism
 invested
 this
 number
 seventy
 and
 the
 graded
 diminution
 in
 the
 number
 of
 altar
 victims
 with
 much
 symbolical
 significance
 not
 set
 forth
 in
 the
 law
 At
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 tradition
 had
 greatly
 embellished
 many
 of
 the
 prescribed
 observances
 Thus
 the
 boughs
 of
 goodly
 trees
 more
 literally
 rendered
 fruit
 Lev
 
 had
 come
 to
 be
 understood
 as
 the
 citron
 fruit
 and
 this
 every
 orthodox
 Jew
 carried
 in
 one
 hand
 while
 in
 the
 other
 he
 bore
 a
 leafy
 branch
 or
 a
 bunch
 of
 twigs
 known
 as
 the
 lulab
 when
 he
 repaired
 to
 the
 temple
 for
 the
 morning
 sacrifice
 and
 in
 the
 joyous
 processions
 of
 the
 day
 The
 ceremonial
 carrying
 of
 water
 from
 the
 spring
 of
 Siloam
 to
 the
 altar
 of
 sacrifice
 was
 a
 prominent
 feature
 of
 the
 service
 This
 water
 was
 mingled
 with
 wine
 at
 the
 altar
 and
 the
 mixture
 was
 poured
 upon
 the
 sacrificial
 offering
 Many
 authorities
 hold
 that
 the
 bringing
 of
 water
 from
 the
 pool
 was
 omitted
 on
 the
 last
 or
 great
 day
 of
 the
 feast
 and
 it
 is
 inferred
 that
 Jesus
 had
 in
 mind
 the
 circumstance
 of
 the
 omission
 when
 He
 cried
 If
 any
 man
 thirst
 let
 him
 come
 unto
 me
 and
 drink
 At
 night
 during
 the
 progress
 of
 the
 feast
 great
 lamps
 were
 kept
 burning
 in
 the
 temple
 courts
 and
 this
 incident
 Christ
 may
 have
 used
 as
 an
 objective
 illustration
 in
 his
 proclamation
 I
 am
 the
 light
 of
 the
 world

 excerpt
 from

 Life
 and
 Times
 of
 Jesus
 The
 Messiah
 vol
 ii
 p
 
 When
 the
 Templeprocession
 had
 reached
 the
 Pool
 of
 Siloam
 the
 priest
 filled
 his
 golden
 pitcher
 from
 its
 waters
 Then
 they
 went
 back
 to
 the
 Temple
 so
 timing
 it
 that
 they
 should
 arrive
 just
 as
 they
 were
 laying
 the
 pieces
 of
 the
 sacrifice
 on
 the
 great
 altar
 of
 burntoffering
 towards
 the
 close
 of
 the
 ordinary
 morningsacrifice
 service
 A
 threefold
 blast
 of
 the
 priests
 trumpets
 welcomed
 the
 arrival
 of
 the
 priest
 as
 he
 entered
 through
 the
 Water
 Gate
 which
 obtained
 its
 name
 from
 this
 ceremony
 and
 passed
 straight
 into
 the
 Court
 of
 the
 Priests
 Immediately
 after
 the
 pouring
 of
 the
 water
 the
 great
 Hallel
 consisting
 of
 Psalms
 
 to
 
 inclusive
 was
 chanted
 antiphonally
 or
 rather
 with
 responses
 to
 the
 accompaniment
 of
 the
 flute
 In
 further
 symbolism
 of
 this
 Feast
 as
 pointing
 to
 the
 ingathering
 of
 the
 heathen
 nations
 the
 public
 services
 closed
 with
 a
 procession
 round
 the
 altar
 by
 the
 priests
 But
 on
 the
 last
 the
 Great
 Day
 of
 the
 Feast
 this
 procession
 of
 priests
 made
 the
 circuit
 of
 the
 altar
 not
 only
 once
 but
 seven
 times
 as
 if
 they
 were
 again
 compassing
 but
 now
 with
 prayer
 the
 Gentile
 Jericho
 which
 barred
 their
 possession
 of
 the
 promised
 land
 
 The
 Test
 of
 our
 Lords
 DoctrineAny
 man
 may
 know
 for
 himself
 whether
 the
 doctrine
 of
 Christ
 is
 of
 God
 or
 not
 by
 simply
 doing
 the
 will
 of
 the
 Father
 John
 
 Surely
 it
 is
 a
 more
 convincing
 course
 than
 that
 of
 relying
 upon
 anothers
 word
 The
 writer
 was
 once
 approached
 by
 an
 incredulous
 student
 in
 college
 who
 stated
 that
 he
 could
 not
 accept
 as
 true
 the
 published
 results
 of
 a
 certain
 chemical
 analysis
 since
 the
 specified
 amounts
 of
 some
 of
 the
 ingredients
 were
 so
 infinitesimally
 small
 that
 he
 could
 not
 believe
 it
 possible
 to
 determine
 such
 minute
 quantities
 The
 student
 was
 but
 a
 beginner
 in
 chemistry
 and
 with
 his
 little
 knowledge
 he
 had
 undertaken
 to
 judge
 as
 to
 the
 possibilities
 of
 the
 science
 He
 was
 told
 to
 do
 the
 things
 his
 instructor
 prescribed
 and
 he
 should
 some
 day
 know
 for
 himself
 whether
 the
 results
 were
 true
 or
 false
 In
 the
 senior
 year
 of
 his
 course
 he
 received
 for
 laboratory
 analysis
 a
 portion
 of
 the
 very
 substance
 whose
 composition
 he
 had
 once
 questioned
 With
 the
 skill
 attained
 by
 faithful
 devotion
 he
 successfully
 completed
 the
 analysis
 and
 reported
 results
 similar
 to
 those
 which
 in
 his
 inexperience
 he
 had
 thought
 impossible
 to
 obtain
 He
 was
 manly
 enough
 to
 acknowledge
 as
 unfounded
 his
 earlier
 skepticism
 and
 rejoiced
 in
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 had
 been
 able
 to
 demonstrate
 the
 truth
 for
 himself
 
 The
 Pool
 of
 SiloamThe
 names
 Shiloah
 Shelah
 Neh
 
 Siloah
 in
 authorized
 version
 and
 Siloam
 are
 the
 exact
 equivalent
 in
 Hebrew
 and
 Greek
 respectively
 of
 Silwan
 in
 the
 modern
 Arabic
 name
 Ain
 Silwan
 of
 the
 pool
 at
 the
 mouth
 of
 ElWad
 All
 the
 ancient
 references
 agree
 with
 this
 identification
 compare
 Neh
 
 Josephus
 Wars
 of
 the
 Jews
 v
 
 
 
 
 
 ii

 In
 spite
 of
 its
 modern
 designation
 as
 an
 ain

 Siloam
 is
 not
 a
 spring

 Whence
 was
 the
 Messiah
 to
 ComeMany
 stifled
 their
 inward
 promptings
 to
 a
 belief
 in
 Jesus
 as
 the
 Messiah
 by
 the
 objection
 that
 all
 prophecies
 relating
 to
 His
 coming
 pointed
 to
 Bethlehem
 as
 His
 birthplace
 and
 Jesus
 was
 of
 Galilee
 Others
 rejected
 Him
 because
 they
 had
 been
 taught
 that
 no
 man
 was
 to
 know
 whence
 the
 Messiah
 came
 and
 they
 all
 knew
 Jesus
 came
 from
 Galilee
 The
 seeming
 inconsistency
 is
 thus
 explained
 The
 city
 of
 David
 or
 Bethlehem
 in
 Judea
 was
 beyond
 question
 the
 foreappointed
 place
 of
 the
 Messiahs
 birth
 but
 the
 rabbis
 had
 erroneously
 taught
 that
 soon
 after
 birth
 the
 Christ
 Child
 would
 be
 caught
 away
 and
 after
 a
 time
 would
 appear
 as
 a
 Man
 and
 that
 no
 one
 would
 know
 whence
 or
 how
 He
 had
 returned
 Geikie
 ii
 p
 
 citing
 Lightfoot
 in
 part
 thus
 states
 the
 popular
 criticism
 Do
 not
 the
 rabbis
 tell
 us
 said
 some
 that
 the
 Messiah
 will
 be
 born
 at
 Bethlehem
 but
 that
 He
 will
 be
 snatched
 away
 by
 spirits
 and
 tempests
 soon
 after
 His
 birth
 and
 that
 when
 He
 returns
 the
 second
 time
 no
 one
 will
 know
 from
 whence
 He
 has
 come
 But
 we
 know
 this
 man
 comes
 from
 Nazareth
 
 The
 Record
 Relating
 to
 the
 Woman
 Taken
 in
 AdulterySome
 modern
 critics
 claim
 that
 the
 verses
 John
 
 and
 
 inclusive
 are
 out
 of
 place
 as
 they
 appear
 in
 the
 authorized
 or
 King
 James
 version
 of
 the
 Bible
 on
 the
 grounds
 that
 the
 incident
 therein
 recorded
 does
 not
 appear
 in
 certain
 of
 the
 ancient
 manuscript
 copies
 of
 Johns
 Gospel
 and
 that
 the
 style
 of
 the
 narrative
 is
 distinctive
 In
 some
 manuscripts
 it
 appears
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 book
 Other
 manuscripts
 contain
 the
 account
 as
 it
 appears
 in
 the
 English
 Bible
 Canon
 Farrar
 pertinently
 asks
 p
 
 note
 why
 if
 the
 incident
 is
 out
 of
 place
 or
 not
 of
 Johns
 authorship
 so
 many
 important
 manuscripts
 give
 place
 to
 it
 as
 we
 have
 it
 
 The

 of
 the

 within
 the
 inner
 courts
 was
 open
 to
 Israelites
 of
 both
 sexes
 and
 was
 known
 distinctively
 as
 the
 Court

 This
 was
 a
 colonnaded
 enclosure

 constituted
 the
 place
 of
 general

 in
 the
 prescribed

 SheepfoldDummelows
 Commentary
 says
 on
 John
 
 To
 understand
 the
 imagery
 it
 must
 be
 remembered
 that
 Eastern
 folds
 are
 large
 open
 enclosures
 into
 which
 several
 flocks
 are
 driven
 at
 the
 approach
 of
 night
 There
 is
 only
 one
 door
 which
 a
 single
 shepherd
 guards
 while
 the
 others
 go
 home
 to
 rest
 In
 the
 morning
 the
 shepherds
 return
 are
 recognized
 by
 the
 doorkeeper
 call
 their
 flocks
 round
 them
 and
 lead
 them
 forth
 to
 pasture

 CHAPTER
 
 OUR
 LORDS
 MINISTRY
 IN
 PEREA
 AND
 JUDEA
 When
 or
 under
 what
 attendant
 circumstances
 our
 Lord
 departed
 from
 Jerusalem
 after
 the
 Feast
 of
 Tabernacles
 in
 the
 last
 autumn
 of
 His
 earthly
 life
 we
 are
 not
 told
 The
 writers
 of
 the
 synoptic
 Gospels
 have
 recorded
 numerous
 discourses
 parables
 and
 miracles
 as
 incidents
 of
 a
 journey
 toward
 Jerusalem
 in
 the
 course
 of
 which
 Jesus
 accompanied
 by
 the
 apostles
 traversed
 parts
 of
 Samaria
 and
 Perea
 and
 the
 outlying
 sections
 of
 Judea
 We
 read
 of
 Christs
 presence
 in
 Jerusalem
 at
 the
 Feast
 of
 Dedication
 between
 two
 and
 three
 months
 after
 the
 Feast
 of
 Tabernacles
 and
 it
 is
 probable
 that
 some
 of
 the
 events
 now
 to
 be
 considered
 occurred
 during
 that
 interval
 That
 Jesus
 left
 Jerusalem
 soon
 after
 the
 Feast
 of
 Tabernacles
 is
 certain
 whether
 He
 returned
 to
 Galilee
 or
 went
 only
 into
 Perea
 possibly
 with
 a
 short
 detour
 across
 the
 border
 into
 Samaria
 is
 not
 conclusively
 stated
 We
 shall
 here
 as
 heretofore
 devote
 our
 study
 primarily
 to
 His
 words
 and
 works
 with
 but
 minor
 regard
 to
 place
 time
 or
 sequence
 As
 the
 time
 of
 His
 foreknown
 betrayal
 and
 crucifixion
 drew
 near
 he
 steadfastly
 set
 his
 face
 to
 go
 to
 Jerusalem
 though
 as
 we
 shall
 find
 He
 turned
 northward
 on
 two
 occasions
 once
 when
 He
 retired
 to
 the
 region
 of
 Bethabara
 and
 again
 to
 Ephraim
 HIS
 REJECTION
 IN
 SAMARIA
 Jesus
 sent
 messengers
 ahead
 to
 announce
 His
 coming
 and
 to
 prepare
 for
 His
 reception
 In
 one
 of
 the
 Samaritan
 villages
 He
 was
 refused
 entertainment
 and
 a
 hearing
 because
 his
 face
 was
 as
 though
 he
 would
 go
 to
 Jerusalem
 Racial
 prejudice
 had
 superseded
 the
 obligations
 of
 hospitality
 This
 repulse
 is
 in
 unfavorable
 contrast
 with
 the
 circumstances
 of
 His
 earlier
 visit
 among
 the
 Samaritans
 when
 He
 had
 been
 received
 with
 gladness
 and
 entreated
 to
 remain
 but
 on
 that
 occasion
 He
 was
 journeying
 not
 toward
 but
 farther
 from
 Jerusalem
 The
 disrespect
 shown
 by
 the
 Samaritans
 was
 more
 than
 the
 disciples
 could
 endure
 without
 protest
 James
 and
 John
 those
 Sons
 of
 Thunder
 were
 so
 resentful
 as
 to
 yearn
 for
 vengeance
 Said
 they
 Lord
 wilt
 thou
 that
 we
 command
 fire
 to
 come
 down
 from
 heaven
 and
 consume
 them
 even
 as
 Elias
 did
 Jesus
 rebuked
 His
 uncharitable
 servants
 thus
 Ye
 know
 not
 what
 manner
 of
 spirit
 ye
 are
 of
 For
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 is
 not
 come
 to
 destroy
 mens
 lives
 but
 to
 save
 them
 Repulsed
 in
 this
 village
 the
 little
 company
 went
 to
 another
 as
 the
 Twelve
 had
 been
 instructed
 to
 do
 under
 like
 circumstances
 This
 was
 but
 one
 of
 the
 impressive
 lessons
 given
 to
 the
 apostles
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 tolerance
 forbearance
 charity
 patience
 and
 longsuffering
 Luke
 gives
 next
 place
 to
 the
 incident
 of
 three
 men
 who
 were
 desirous
 or
 willing
 to
 become
 disciples
 of
 Christ
 one
 of
 them
 seems
 to
 have
 been
 discouraged
 at
 the
 prospect
 of
 hardship
 such
 as
 the
 ministry
 entailed
 the
 others
 wished
 to
 be
 temporarily
 excused
 from
 service
 one
 that
 he
 might
 attend
 the
 burial
 of
 his
 father
 the
 other
 that
 he
 might
 first
 bid
 his
 loved
 ones
 farewell
 This
 or
 a
 similar
 occurrence
 is
 recorded
 by
 Matthew
 in
 another
 connection
 and
 has
 already
 received
 attention
 in
 these
 pages
 THE
 SEVENTY
 CHARGED
 AND
 SENT
 The
 supreme
 importance
 of
 our
 Lords
 ministry
 and
 the
 shortness
 of
 the
 time
 remaining
 to
 Him
 in
 the
 flesh
 demanded
 more
 missionary
 laborers
 The
 Twelve
 were
 to
 remain
 with
 Him
 to
 the
 end
 every
 hour
 of
 possible
 instruction
 and
 training
 had
 to
 be
 utilized
 in
 their
 further
 preparation
 for
 the
 great
 responsibilities
 that
 would
 rest
 upon
 them
 after
 the
 Masters
 departure
 As
 assistants
 in
 the
 ministry
 He
 called
 and
 commissioned
 the
 Seventy
 and
 straightway
 sent
 them
 forth
 two
 and
 two
 before
 his
 face
 into
 every
 city
 and
 place
 whither
 he
 himself
 would
 come
 The
 need
 of
 their
 service
 was
 explained
 in
 the
 introduction
 to
 the
 impressive
 charge
 by
 which
 they
 were
 instructed
 in
 the
 duties
 of
 their
 calling
 Therefore
 said
 he
 unto
 them
 The
 harvest
 truly
 is
 great
 but
 the
 labourers
 are
 few
 pray
 ye
 therefore
 the
 Lord
 of
 the
 harvest
 that
 he
 would
 send
 forth
 labourers
 into
 his
 harvest
 Many
 matters
 on
 which
 the
 Twelve
 had
 been
 instructed
 prior
 to
 their
 missionary
 tour
 were
 now
 repeated
 to
 the
 Seventy
 They
 were
 told
 that
 they
 must
 expect
 unfriendly
 and
 even
 hostile
 treatment
 their
 situation
 would
 be
 as
 that
 of
 lambs
 among
 wolves
 They
 were
 to
 travel
 without
 purse
 or
 scrip
 and
 thus
 necessarily
 to
 depend
 upon
 the
 provision
 that
 God
 would
 make
 through
 those
 to
 whom
 they
 came
 As
 their
 mission
 was
 urgent
 they
 were
 not
 to
 stop
 on
 the
 way
 to
 make
 or
 renew
 personal
 acquaintanceships
 On
 entering
 a
 house
 they
 were
 to
 invoke
 peace
 upon
 it
 if
 the
 household
 deserved
 the
 gift
 peace
 would
 rest
 therein
 but
 otherwise
 the
 Lords
 servants
 would
 feel
 that
 their
 invocation
 was
 void
 To
 any
 family
 by
 whom
 they
 were
 received
 they
 were
 to
 impart
 blessinghealing
 the
 afflicted
 and
 proclaiming
 that
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 had
 come
 nigh
 unto
 that
 house
 They
 were
 not
 to
 go
 from
 one
 house
 to
 another
 seeking
 better
 entertainment
 nor
 should
 they
 expect
 or
 desire
 to
 be
 feasted
 but
 they
 should
 accept
 what
 was
 offered
 eating
 that
 which
 was
 set
 before
 them
 thus
 sharing
 with
 the
 family
 If
 rejected
 in
 any
 city
 they
 were
 to
 depart
 therefrom
 leaving
 however
 their
 solemn
 testimony
 that
 the
 city
 had
 turned
 away
 from
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 which
 had
 been
 brought
 to
 its
 doors
 and
 attesting
 the
 same
 by
 ridding
 themselves
 of
 the
 dust
 of
 that
 place
 It
 was
 not
 for
 them
 to
 pronounce
 anathema
 or
 curse
 but
 the
 Lord
 assured
 them
 that
 such
 a
 city
 would
 bring
 upon
 itself
 a
 fate
 worse
 than
 the
 doom
 of
 Sodom
 He
 reminded
 them
 that
 they
 were
 His
 servants
 and
 therefore
 whoever
 heard
 or
 refused
 to
 hear
 them
 would
 be
 judged
 as
 having
 so
 treated
 Him
 They
 were
 not
 restrained
 as
 the
 Twelve
 had
 been
 from
 entering
 Samaritan
 towns
 or
 the
 lands
 of
 the
 Gentiles
 This
 difference
 is
 consistent
 with
 the
 changed
 conditions
 for
 now
 the
 prospective
 itinerary
 of
 Jesus
 would
 take
 Him
 into
 nonJewish
 territory
 where
 His
 fame
 had
 already
 spread
 and
 furthermore
 His
 plan
 provided
 for
 an
 extension
 of
 the
 gospel
 propaganda
 which
 was
 to
 be
 ultimately
 worldwide
 The
 narrow
 Jewish
 prejudice
 against
 Gentiles
 in
 general
 and
 Samaritans
 in
 particular
 was
 to
 be
 discountenanced
 and
 proof
 of
 this
 intent
 could
 not
 be
 better
 given
 than
 by
 sending
 authorized
 ministers
 among
 those
 peoples
 We
 must
 keep
 in
 mind
 the
 progressiveness
 of
 the
 Lords
 work
 At
 first
 the
 field
 of
 gospel
 preaching
 was
 confined
 to
 the
 land
 of
 Israel
 but
 the
 beginning
 of
 its
 extension
 was
 inaugurated
 during
 our
 Lords
 life
 and
 was
 expressly
 enjoined
 upon
 the
 apostles
 after
 His
 resurrection
 Duly
 instructed
 the
 Seventy
 set
 out
 upon
 their
 mission
 Mention
 of
 the
 condemnation
 that
 would
 follow
 wilful
 rejection
 of
 the
 authorized
 servants
 of
 God
 aroused
 in
 our
 Lords
 mind
 sad
 memories
 of
 the
 repulses
 He
 had
 suffered
 and
 of
 the
 many
 unrepentant
 souls
 in
 the
 cities
 wherein
 He
 had
 accomplished
 so
 many
 mighty
 works
 In
 profound
 sorrow
 He
 predicted
 the
 woes
 then
 impending
 over
 Chorazin
 Bethsaida
 and
 Capernaum
 THE
 SEVENTY
 RETURN
 Considerable
 time
 may
 have
 elapsed
 weeks
 or
 possibly
 months
 between
 the
 departure
 of
 the
 Seventy
 and
 their
 return
 We
 are
 not
 told
 when
 or
 where
 they
 rejoined
 the
 Master
 but
 this
 we
 know
 that
 the
 authority
 and
 power
 of
 Christ
 had
 been
 abundantly
 manifest
 in
 their
 ministry
 and
 that
 they
 had
 rejoiced
 in
 the
 realization
 Lord
 said
 they
 even
 the
 devils
 are
 subject
 unto
 us
 through
 thy
 name
 This
 testimony
 was
 followed
 by
 the
 Lords
 solemn
 statement
 I
 beheld
 Satan
 as
 lightning
 fall
 from
 heaven
 This
 was
 said
 with
 reference
 to
 the
 expulsion
 of
 the
 rebellious
 son
 of
 the
 morning
 after
 his
 defeat
 by
 Michael
 and
 the
 heavenly
 hosts
 Commending
 the
 Seventy
 for
 their
 faithful
 labors
 the
 Lord
 gave
 them
 assurance
 of
 further
 power
 on
 the
 implied
 condition
 of
 their
 continued
 worthiness
 I
 give
 unto
 you
 power
 to
 tread
 on
 serpents
 and
 scorpions
 and
 over
 all
 the
 power
 of
 the
 enemy
 and
 nothing
 shall
 by
 any
 means
 hurt
 you
 The
 promise
 that
 they
 should
 tread
 on
 serpents
 and
 scorpions
 included
 immunity
 from
 injury
 by
 venomous
 creatures
 if
 encountered
 in
 the
 path
 of
 duty
 and
 power
 to
 prevail
 over
 the
 wicked
 spirits
 that
 serve
 the
 devil
 who
 is
 elsewhere
 expressly
 called
 the
 serpent
 Great
 as
 was
 the
 power
 and
 authority
 thus
 imparted
 these
 disciples
 were
 told
 not
 to
 rejoice
 in
 such
 nor
 primarily
 in
 the
 fact
 that
 evil
 spirits
 were
 subject
 unto
 them
 but
 rather
 because
 they
 were
 accepted
 of
 the
 Lord
 and
 that
 their
 names
 were
 written
 in
 heaven
 The
 righteous
 joy
 of
 His
 servants
 and
 His
 contemplation
 of
 their
 faithfulness
 caused
 Jesus
 to
 rejoice
 His
 happiness
 found
 its
 most
 appropriate
 expression
 in
 prayer
 and
 thus
 He
 prayed
 I
 thank
 thee
 O
 Father
 Lord
 of
 heaven
 and
 earth
 that
 thou
 hast
 hid
 these
 things
 from
 the
 wise
 and
 prudent
 and
 hast
 revealed
 them
 unto
 babes
 even
 so
 Father
 for
 so
 it
 seemed
 good
 in
 thy
 sight
 Compared
 with
 the
 learned
 men
 of
 the
 time
 such
 as
 the
 rabbis
 and
 scribes
 whose
 knowledge
 served
 but
 to
 harden
 their
 hearts
 against
 the
 truth
 these
 devoted
 servants
 were
 as
 babes
 in
 humility
 trust
 and
 faith
 Such
 children
 were
 and
 are
 among
 the
 nobles
 of
 the
 kingdom
 As
 in
 the
 hours
 of
 darkest
 sorrow
 so
 in
 this
 moment
 of
 righteous
 exultation
 over
 the
 faithfulness
 of
 His
 followers
 Jesus
 communed
 with
 the
 Father
 to
 do
 whose
 will
 was
 His
 sole
 purpose
 Our
 Lords
 joy
 on
 this
 occasion
 is
 comparable
 to
 that
 which
 He
 experienced
 when
 Peter
 had
 burst
 forth
 with
 the
 confession
 of
 his
 soul
 Thou
 art
 the
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 the
 living
 God
 In
 solemn
 discourse
 Jesus
 said
 All
 things
 are
 delivered
 to
 me
 of
 my
 Father
 and
 no
 man
 knoweth
 who
 the
 Son
 is
 but
 the
 Father
 and
 who
 the
 Father
 is
 but
 the
 Son
 and
 he
 to
 whom
 the
 Son
 will
 reveal
 him
 Then
 in
 more
 intimate
 communion
 with
 the
 disciples
 He
 added
 Blessed
 are
 the
 eyes
 which
 see
 the
 things
 that
 ye
 see
 For
 I
 tell
 you
 that
 many
 prophets
 and
 kings
 have
 desired
 to
 see
 those
 things
 which
 ye
 see
 and
 have
 not
 seen
 them
 and
 to
 hear
 those
 things
 which
 ye
 hear
 and
 have
 not
 heard
 them
 WHO
 IS
 MY
 NEIGHBOR
 We
 have
 seen
 that
 the
 Pharisees
 and
 their
 kind
 were
 constantly
 on
 the
 alert
 to
 annoy
 and
 if
 possible
 disconcert
 Jesus
 on
 questions
 of
 law
 and
 doctrine
 and
 to
 provoke
 Him
 to
 some
 overt
 utterance
 or
 deed
 It
 may
 be
 such
 an
 attempt
 that
 is
 recorded
 by
 Luke
 in
 immediate
 sequence
 to
 his
 account
 of
 the
 joyous
 return
 of
 the
 Seventy
 for
 he
 tells
 us
 that
 the
 certain
 lawyer
 of
 whom
 he
 speaks
 put
 a
 question
 to
 tempt
 Jesus
 Viewing
 the
 questioners
 motive
 with
 all
 possible
 charity
 for
 the
 basal
 meaning
 of
 the
 verb
 which
 appears
 in
 our
 version
 of
 the
 Bible
 as
 to
 tempt
 is
 that
 of
 putting
 to
 test
 or
 trial
 and
 not
 necessarily
 and
 solely
 to
 allure
 into
 evil
 though
 the
 element
 of
 entrapping
 or
 ensnaring
 is
 connoted
 we
 may
 assume
 that
 he
 wished
 to
 test
 the
 knowledge
 and
 wisdom
 of
 the
 famous
 Teacher
 probably
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 embarrassing
 Him
 Certainly
 his
 purpose
 was
 not
 that
 of
 sincere
 search
 for
 truth
 This
 lawyer
 standing
 up
 among
 the
 people
 who
 had
 gathered
 to
 hear
 Jesus
 asked
 Master
 what
 shall
 I
 do
 to
 inherit
 eternal
 life
 Jesus
 replied
 by
 a
 counter
 question
 in
 which
 was
 plainly
 intimated
 that
 if
 this
 man
 who
 was
 professedly
 learned
 in
 the
 law
 had
 read
 and
 studied
 properly
 he
 should
 know
 without
 asking
 what
 he
 ought
 to
 do
 What
 is
 written
 in
 the
 law
 how
 readest
 thou
 The
 man
 replied
 with
 an
 admirable
 summary
 of
 the
 commandments
 Thou
 shalt
 love
 the
 Lord
 thy
 God
 with
 all
 thy
 heart
 and
 with
 all
 thy
 soul
 and
 with
 all
 thy
 strength
 and
 with
 all
 thy
 mind
 and
 thy
 neighbour
 as
 thyself
 The
 answer
 was
 approved
 This
 do
 and
 thou
 shalt
 live
 said
 Jesus
 These
 simple
 words
 conveyed
 a
 rebuke
 as
 the
 lawyer
 must
 have
 realized
 they
 indicated
 the
 contrast
 between
 knowing
 and
 doing
 Having
 thus
 failed
 in
 his
 plan
 to
 confound
 the
 Master
 and
 probably
 realizing
 that
 he
 a
 lawyer
 had
 made
 no
 creditable
 display
 of
 his
 erudition
 by
 asking
 so
 simple
 a
 question
 and
 then
 answering
 it
 himself
 he
 tamely
 sought
 to
 justify
 himself
 by
 inquiring
 further
 And
 who
 is
 my
 neighbour
 We
 may
 well
 be
 grateful
 for
 the
 lawyers
 question
 for
 it
 served
 to
 draw
 from
 the
 Masters
 inexhaustible
 store
 of
 wisdom
 one
 of
 His
 most
 appreciated
 parables
 The
 story
 is
 known
 as
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Good
 Samaritan
 it
 runs
 as
 follows
 A
 certain
 man
 went
 down
 from
 Jerusalem
 to
 Jericho
 and
 fell
 among
 thieves
 which
 stripped
 him
 of
 his
 raiment
 and
 wounded
 him
 and
 departed
 leaving
 him
 half
 dead
 And
 by
 chance
 there
 came
 down
 a
 certain
 priest
 that
 way
 and
 when
 he
 saw
 him
 he
 passed
 by
 on
 the
 other
 side
 And
 likewise
 a
 Levite
 when
 he
 was
 at
 the
 place
 came
 and
 looked
 on
 him
 and
 passed
 by
 on
 the
 other
 side
 But
 a
 certain
 Samaritan
 as
 he
 journeyed
 came
 where
 he
 was
 and
 when
 he
 saw
 him
 he
 had
 compassion
 on
 him
 and
 went
 to
 him
 and
 bound
 up
 his
 wounds
 pouring
 in
 oil
 and
 wine
 and
 set
 him
 on
 his
 own
 beast
 and
 brought
 him
 to
 an
 inn
 and
 took
 care
 of
 him
 And
 on
 the
 morrow
 when
 he
 departed
 he
 took
 out
 two
 pence
 and
 gave
 them
 to
 the
 host
 and
 said
 unto
 him
 Take
 care
 of
 him
 and
 whatsoever
 thou
 spendest
 more
 when
 I
 come
 again
 I
 will
 repay
 thee
 Then
 of
 the
 lawyer
 Jesus
 asked
 Which
 now
 of
 these
 three
 thinkest
 thou
 was
 neighbor
 unto
 him
 that
 fell
 among
 the
 thieves
 And
 he
 said
 He
 that
 shewed
 mercy
 on
 him
 Then
 said
 Jesus
 unto
 him
 Go
 and
 do
 thou
 likewise
 Whatever
 of
 motive
 there
 may
 have
 been
 in
 the
 lawyers
 query
 Who
 is
 my
 neighbour
 aside
 from
 that
 of
 selfjustification
 and
 a
 desire
 to
 retreat
 in
 the
 best
 form
 possible
 from
 an
 embarrassing
 situation
 we
 may
 conceive
 to
 lie
 in
 the
 wish
 to
 find
 a
 limitation
 in
 the
 application
 of
 the
 law
 beyond
 which
 he
 would
 not
 be
 bound
 to
 go
 If
 he
 had
 to
 love
 his
 neighbors
 as
 he
 loved
 himself
 he
 wanted
 to
 have
 as
 few
 neighbors
 as
 possible
 His
 desire
 may
 have
 been
 somewhat
 akin
 to
 that
 of
 Peter
 who
 was
 eager
 to
 learn
 just
 how
 many
 times
 he
 was
 required
 to
 forgive
 an
 offending
 brother
 The
 parable
 with
 which
 our
 Lord
 replied
 to
 the
 lawyers
 question
 is
 rich
 in
 interest
 as
 a
 story
 alone
 and
 particularly
 so
 as
 an
 embodiment
 of
 precious
 lessons
 It
 was
 withal
 so
 true
 to
 existing
 conditions
 that
 like
 the
 story
 of
 the
 sower
 who
 went
 forth
 to
 sow
 and
 other
 parables
 given
 by
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 it
 may
 be
 true
 history
 as
 well
 as
 parable
 The
 road
 between
 Jerusalem
 and
 Jericho
 was
 known
 to
 be
 infested
 by
 highway
 robbers
 indeed
 a
 section
 of
 the
 thoroughfare
 was
 called
 the
 Red
 Path
 or
 Bloody
 Way
 because
 of
 the
 frequent
 atrocities
 committed
 thereon
 Jericho
 was
 prominent
 as
 a
 residence
 place
 for
 priests
 and
 Levites
 A
 priest
 who
 out
 of
 respect
 to
 his
 office
 if
 for
 none
 other
 cause
 should
 have
 been
 willing
 and
 prompt
 in
 acts
 of
 mercy
 caught
 sight
 of
 the
 wounded
 traveler
 and
 passed
 by
 on
 the
 far
 side
 of
 the
 road
 A
 Levite
 followed
 he
 paused
 to
 look
 then
 passed
 on
 These
 ought
 to
 have
 remembered
 the
 specified
 requirement
 of
 the
 lawthat
 if
 one
 saw
 an
 ass
 or
 an
 ox
 fall
 down
 by
 the
 way
 he
 should
 not
 hide
 himself
 but
 should
 surely
 help
 the
 owner
 to
 lift
 the
 creature
 up
 again
 If
 such
 was
 their
 duty
 toward
 a
 brothers
 beast
 much
 greater
 was
 their
 obligation
 when
 a
 brother
 himself
 was
 in
 so
 extreme
 a
 plight
 Doubtless
 priest
 as
 well
 as
 Levite
 salved
 his
 conscience
 with
 ample
 excuse
 for
 his
 inhumane
 conduct
 he
 may
 have
 been
 in
 a
 hurry
 or
 was
 fearful
 perhaps
 that
 the
 robbers
 would
 return
 and
 make
 him
 also
 a
 victim
 of
 their
 outrage
 Excuses
 are
 easy
 to
 find
 they
 spring
 up
 as
 readily
 and
 plentifully
 as
 weeds
 by
 the
 wayside
 When
 the
 Samaritan
 came
 along
 and
 saw
 the
 wretched
 state
 of
 the
 wounded
 man
 he
 had
 no
 excuse
 for
 he
 wanted
 none
 Having
 done
 what
 he
 could
 by
 way
 of
 emergency
 treatment
 as
 recognized
 in
 the
 medical
 practise
 of
 the
 day
 he
 placed
 the
 injured
 one
 upon
 his
 own
 beast
 probably
 a
 mule
 or
 an
 ass
 and
 took
 him
 to
 the
 nearest
 inn
 where
 he
 tended
 him
 personally
 and
 made
 arrangements
 for
 his
 further
 care
 The
 essential
 difference
 between
 the
 Samaritan
 and
 the
 others
 was
 that
 the
 one
 had
 a
 compassionate
 heart
 while
 they
 were
 unloving
 and
 selfish
 Though
 not
 definitely
 stated
 the
 victim
 of
 the
 robbers
 was
 almost
 certainly
 a
 Jew
 the
 point
 of
 the
 parable
 requires
 it
 to
 be
 so
 That
 the
 merciful
 one
 was
 a
 Samaritan
 showed
 that
 the
 people
 called
 heretic
 and
 despized
 by
 the
 Jews
 could
 excel
 in
 good
 works
 To
 a
 Jew
 none
 but
 Jews
 were
 neighbors
 We
 are
 not
 justified
 in
 regarding
 priest
 Levite
 or
 Samaritan
 as
 the
 type
 of
 his
 class
 doubtless
 there
 were
 many
 kind
 and
 charitable
 Jews
 and
 many
 heartless
 Samaritans
 but
 the
 Masters
 lesson
 was
 admirably
 illustrated
 by
 the
 characters
 in
 the
 parable
 and
 the
 words
 of
 His
 application
 were
 pungent
 in
 their
 simplicity
 and
 appropriateness
 MARTHA
 AND
 MARY
 On
 one
 of
 His
 visits
 to
 Bethany
 a
 small
 town
 about
 two
 miles
 from
 Jerusalem
 Jesus
 was
 received
 at
 the
 home
 where
 dwelt
 two
 sisters
 Martha
 and
 Mary
 Martha
 was
 housekeeper
 and
 therefore
 she
 assumed
 responsibility
 for
 the
 proper
 treatment
 of
 the
 distinguished
 Guest
 While
 she
 busied
 herself
 with
 preparations
 and
 was
 cumbered
 about
 much
 serving
 well
 intended
 for
 the
 comfort
 and
 entertainment
 of
 Jesus
 Mary
 sat
 at
 the
 Masters
 feet
 listening
 with
 reverent
 attention
 to
 His
 words
 Martha
 grew
 fretful
 in
 her
 bustling
 anxiety
 and
 came
 in
 saying
 Lord
 dost
 thou
 not
 care
 that
 my
 sister
 hath
 left
 me
 to
 serve
 alone
 bid
 her
 therefore
 that
 she
 help
 me
 She
 was
 talking
 to
 Jesus
 but
 really
 at
 Mary
 For
 the
 moment
 she
 had
 lost
 her
 calmness
 in
 undue
 worry
 over
 incidental
 details
 It
 is
 reasonable
 to
 infer
 that
 Jesus
 was
 on
 terms
 of
 familiarity
 in
 the
 household
 else
 the
 good
 woman
 would
 scarcely
 have
 appealed
 to
 Him
 in
 a
 little
 matter
 of
 domestic
 concern
 He
 replied
 to
 her
 complaining
 words
 with
 marked
 tenderness
 Martha
 Martha
 thou
 art
 careful
 and
 troubled
 about
 many
 things
 but
 one
 thing
 is
 needful
 and
 Mary
 hath
 chosen
 that
 good
 part
 which
 shall
 not
 be
 taken
 away
 from
 her
 There
 was
 no
 reproof
 of
 Marthas
 desire
 to
 provide
 well
 nor
 any
 sanction
 of
 possible
 neglect
 on
 Marys
 part
 We
 must
 suppose
 that
 Mary
 had
 been
 a
 willing
 helper
 before
 the
 Masters
 arrival
 but
 now
 that
 He
 had
 come
 she
 chose
 to
 remain
 with
 Him
 Had
 she
 been
 culpably
 neglectful
 of
 her
 duty
 Jesus
 would
 not
 have
 commended
 her
 course
 He
 desired
 not
 wellserved
 meals
 and
 material
 comforts
 only
 but
 the
 company
 of
 the
 sisters
 and
 above
 all
 their
 receptive
 attention
 to
 what
 He
 had
 to
 say
 He
 had
 more
 to
 give
 them
 than
 they
 could
 possibly
 provide
 for
 Him
 Jesus
 loved
 the
 two
 sisters
 and
 their
 brother
 as
 well
 Both
 these
 women
 were
 devoted
 to
 Jesus
 and
 each
 expressed
 herself
 in
 her
 own
 way
 Martha
 was
 of
 a
 practical
 turn
 concerned
 in
 material
 service
 she
 was
 by
 nature
 hospitable
 and
 selfdenying
 Mary
 contemplative
 and
 more
 spiritually
 inclined
 showed
 her
 devotion
 through
 the
 service
 of
 companionship
 and
 appreciation
 By
 inattention
 to
 household
 duties
 the
 little
 touches
 that
 make
 or
 mar
 the
 family
 peace
 many
 a
 woman
 has
 reduced
 her
 home
 to
 a
 comfortless
 house
 and
 many
 another
 has
 eliminated
 the
 essential
 elements
 of
 home
 by
 her
 selfassumed
 and
 persistent
 drudgery
 in
 which
 she
 denies
 to
 her
 dear
 ones
 the
 cheer
 of
 her
 loving
 companionship
 Onesided
 service
 however
 devoted
 may
 become
 neglect
 There
 is
 a
 time
 for
 labor
 inside
 the
 home
 as
 in
 the
 open
 in
 every
 family
 time
 should
 be
 found
 for
 cultivating
 that
 better
 part
 that
 one
 thing
 needfultrue
 spiritual
 development
 ASK
 AND
 IT
 SHALL
 BE
 GIVEN
 YOU
 And
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 that
 as
 he
 was
 praying
 in
 a
 certain
 place
 when
 he
 ceased
 one
 of
 his
 disciples
 said
 unto
 him
 Lord
 teach
 us
 to
 pray
 Our
 Lords
 example
 and
 the
 spirit
 of
 prayer
 manifest
 in
 His
 daily
 life
 moved
 the
 disciples
 to
 ask
 for
 instruction
 as
 to
 how
 they
 should
 pray
 No
 form
 of
 private
 prayer
 was
 given
 in
 the
 law
 but
 formal
 prayers
 had
 been
 prescribed
 by
 the
 Jewish
 authorities
 and
 John
 the
 Baptist
 had
 instructed
 his
 followers
 in
 the
 mode
 or
 manner
 of
 prayer
 Responding
 to
 the
 disciples
 request
 Jesus
 repeated
 that
 brief
 epitome
 of
 soulful
 adoration
 and
 supplication
 which
 we
 call
 the
 Lords
 Prayer
 This
 He
 had
 before
 given
 in
 connection
 with
 the
 Sermon
 on
 the
 Mount
 On
 this
 occasion
 of
 its
 repetition
 the
 Lord
 supplemented
 the
 prayer
 by
 explaining
 the
 imperative
 necessity
 of
 earnestness
 and
 enduring
 persistency
 in
 praying
 The
 lesson
 was
 made
 plain
 by
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Friend
 at
 Midnight
 And
 he
 said
 unto
 them
 Which
 of
 you
 shall
 have
 a
 friend
 and
 shall
 go
 unto
 him
 at
 midnight
 and
 say
 unto
 him
 Friend
 lend
 me
 three
 loaves
 For
 a
 friend
 of
 mine
 in
 his
 journey
 is
 come
 to
 me
 and
 I
 have
 nothing
 to
 set
 before
 him
 And
 he
 from
 within
 shall
 answer
 and
 say
 Trouble
 me
 not
 the
 door
 is
 now
 shut
 and
 my
 children
 are
 with
 me
 in
 bed
 I
 cannot
 rise
 and
 give
 thee
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Though
 he
 will
 not
 rise
 and
 give
 him
 because
 he
 is
 his
 friend
 yet
 because
 of
 his
 importunity
 he
 will
 rise
 and
 give
 him
 as
 many
 as
 he
 needeth
 The
 man
 to
 whose
 home
 a
 friend
 had
 come
 at
 midnight
 could
 not
 let
 his
 belated
 and
 weary
 guest
 go
 hungry
 yet
 there
 was
 no
 bread
 in
 the
 house
 He
 made
 his
 visitors
 wants
 his
 own
 and
 pleaded
 at
 his
 neighbors
 door
 as
 though
 asking
 for
 himself
 The
 neighbor
 was
 loath
 to
 leave
 his
 comfortable
 bed
 and
 disturb
 his
 household
 to
 accommodate
 another
 but
 finding
 that
 the
 man
 at
 the
 door
 was
 importunate
 he
 at
 last
 arose
 and
 gave
 him
 what
 he
 asked
 so
 as
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 him
 and
 be
 able
 to
 sleep
 in
 peace
 The
 Master
 added
 by
 way
 of
 comment
 and
 instruction
 Ask
 and
 it
 shall
 be
 given
 you
 seek
 and
 ye
 shall
 find
 knock
 and
 it
 shall
 be
 opened
 unto
 you
 The
 hospitable
 man
 in
 the
 parable
 had
 refused
 to
 be
 repulsed
 he
 kept
 on
 knocking
 until
 the
 door
 was
 opened
 and
 as
 a
 result
 received
 what
 he
 wanted
 found
 what
 he
 had
 set
 out
 to
 obtain
 The
 parable
 is
 regarded
 by
 some
 as
 a
 difficult
 one
 to
 apply
 since
 it
 deals
 with
 the
 selfish
 and
 comfortloving
 element
 of
 human
 nature
 and
 apparently
 uses
 this
 to
 symbolize
 Gods
 deliberate
 delay
 The
 explanation
 however
 is
 clear
 when
 the
 context
 is
 duly
 considered
 The
 Lords
 lesson
 was
 that
 if
 man
 with
 all
 his
 selfishness
 and
 disinclination
 to
 give
 will
 nevertheless
 grant
 what
 his
 neighbor
 with
 proper
 purpose
 asks
 and
 continues
 to
 ask
 in
 spite
 of
 objection
 and
 temporary
 refusal
 with
 assured
 certainty
 will
 God
 grant
 what
 is
 persistently
 asked
 in
 faith
 and
 with
 righteous
 intent
 No
 parallelism
 lies
 between
 mans
 selfish
 refusal
 and
 Gods
 wise
 and
 beneficent
 waiting
 There
 must
 be
 a
 consciousness
 of
 real
 need
 for
 prayer
 and
 real
 trust
 in
 God
 to
 make
 prayer
 effective
 and
 in
 mercy
 the
 Father
 sometimes
 delays
 the
 granting
 that
 the
 asking
 may
 be
 more
 fervent
 But
 in
 the
 words
 of
 Jesus
 If
 ye
 then
 being
 evil
 know
 how
 to
 give
 good
 gifts
 unto
 your
 children
 how
 much
 more
 shall
 your
 heavenly
 Father
 give
 the
 Holy
 Spirit
 to
 them
 that
 ask
 him
 Sometime
 later
 Jesus
 spake
 another
 parable
 the
 moral
 of
 which
 is
 so
 closely
 akin
 to
 that
 of
 the
 story
 of
 the
 midnight
 visitor
 as
 to
 suggest
 the
 study
 of
 the
 later
 lesson
 here
 It
 is
 known
 as
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Unjust
 Judge
 or
 of
 the
 Importunate
 Widow
 There
 was
 in
 a
 city
 a
 judge
 which
 feared
 not
 God
 neither
 regarded
 man
 And
 there
 was
 a
 widow
 in
 that
 city
 and
 she
 came
 unto
 him
 saying
 Avenge
 me
 of
 mine
 adversary
 And
 he
 would
 not
 for
 a
 while
 but
 afterward
 he
 said
 within
 himself
 Though
 I
 fear
 not
 God
 nor
 regard
 man
 Yet
 because
 this
 widow
 troubleth
 me
 I
 will
 avenge
 her
 lest
 by
 her
 continual
 coming
 she
 weary
 me
 The
 judge
 was
 of
 wicked
 character
 he
 denied
 justice
 to
 the
 widow
 who
 could
 obtain
 redress
 from
 none
 other
 He
 was
 moved
 to
 action
 by
 the
 desire
 to
 escape
 the
 womans
 importunity
 Let
 us
 beware
 of
 the
 error
 of
 comparing
 his
 selfish
 action
 with
 the
 ways
 of
 God
 Jesus
 did
 not
 indicate
 that
 as
 the
 wicked
 judge
 finally
 yielded
 to
 supplication
 so
 would
 God
 do
 but
 He
 pointed
 out
 that
 if
 even
 such
 a
 being
 as
 this
 judge
 who
 feared
 not
 God
 neither
 regarded
 man
 would
 at
 last
 hear
 and
 grant
 the
 widows
 plea
 no
 one
 should
 doubt
 that
 God
 the
 Just
 and
 Merciful
 will
 hear
 and
 answer
 The
 judges
 obduracy
 though
 wholly
 wicked
 on
 his
 part
 may
 have
 been
 ultimately
 advantageous
 to
 the
 widow
 Had
 she
 easily
 obtained
 redress
 she
 might
 have
 become
 again
 unwary
 and
 perchance
 a
 worse
 adversary
 than
 the
 first
 might
 have
 oppressed
 her
 The
 Lords
 purpose
 in
 giving
 the
 parable
 is
 specifically
 stated
 it
 was
 to
 this
 end
 that
 men
 ought
 always
 to
 pray
 and
 not
 to
 faint
 CRITICISM
 ON
 PHARISEES
 AND
 LAWYERS
 Varied
 comment
 as
 to
 the
 source
 of
 our
 Lords
 superhuman
 powers
 was
 aroused
 afresh
 by
 His
 merciful
 act
 of
 expelling
 a
 demon
 from
 a
 man
 who
 in
 consequence
 of
 this
 evil
 possession
 had
 been
 dumb
 The
 old
 Pharisaic
 theory
 that
 He
 cast
 out
 devils
 through
 the
 power
 of
 Beelzebub
 the
 chief
 of
 the
 devils
 was
 revived
 The
 utter
 foolishness
 of
 such
 a
 conception
 was
 demonstrated
 as
 it
 had
 been
 on
 an
 earlier
 occasion
 to
 which
 we
 have
 given
 attention
 The
 spiritual
 darkness
 in
 which
 evil
 men
 grope
 for
 signs
 the
 disappointment
 and
 condemnation
 that
 await
 them
 and
 other
 precious
 precepts
 Jesus
 elucidated
 in
 further
 discourse
 Then
 by
 invitation
 He
 went
 to
 the
 house
 of
 a
 certain
 Pharisee
 to
 dine
 Other
 Pharisees
 as
 also
 lawyers
 and
 scribes
 were
 present
 Jesus
 intentionally
 omitted
 the
 ceremonial
 washing
 of
 hands
 which
 all
 others
 in
 the
 company
 scrupulously
 performed
 before
 taking
 their
 places
 at
 table
 This
 omission
 caused
 a
 murmur
 of
 disapproval
 if
 not
 an
 open
 expression
 of
 faultfinding
 Jesus
 utilized
 the
 occasion
 by
 voicing
 a
 pungent
 criticism
 of
 Pharisaic
 externalism
 which
 He
 likened
 to
 the
 cleansing
 of
 cups
 and
 platters
 on
 the
 outside
 while
 the
 inside
 is
 left
 filthy
 Fools
 said
 He
 did
 not
 he
 that
 made
 that
 which
 is
 without
 make
 that
 which
 is
 within
 also
 In
 another
 form
 we
 may
 ask
 Did
 not
 God
 who
 established
 the
 outward
 observances
 of
 the
 law
 ordain
 the
 inward
 and
 spiritual
 requirements
 of
 the
 gospel
 also
 In
 response
 to
 a
 question
 by
 one
 of
 the
 lawyers
 Jesus
 included
 them
 in
 His
 sweeping
 reproof
 Pharisees
 and
 scribes
 resented
 the
 censure
 to
 which
 they
 had
 been
 subjected
 and
 began
 to
 urge
 him
 vehemently
 and
 to
 provoke
 him
 to
 speak
 of
 many
 things
 laying
 wait
 for
 him
 and
 seeking
 to
 catch
 something
 out
 of
 his
 mouth
 that
 they
 might
 accuse
 him
 As
 our
 Lords
 recorded
 utterances
 on
 this
 occasion
 appear
 also
 in
 His
 final
 denunciation
 of
 Pharisaism
 later
 delivered
 at
 the
 temple
 we
 may
 well
 defer
 further
 consideration
 of
 the
 matter
 until
 we
 take
 up
 in
 order
 that
 notable
 occurrence
 THE
 DISCIPLES
 ADMONISHED
 AND
 ENCOURAGED
 Popular
 interest
 in
 our
 Lords
 movements
 was
 strong
 in
 the
 region
 beyond
 Jordan
 as
 it
 had
 been
 in
 Galilee
 We
 read
 of
 Him
 surrounded
 by
 an
 innumerable
 multitude
 of
 people
 insomuch
 that
 they
 trode
 one
 upon
 another
 Addressing
 the
 multitude
 and
 more
 particularly
 His
 disciples
 Jesus
 warned
 them
 of
 the
 leaven
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 which
 He
 characterized
 as
 hypocrisy
 The
 recent
 scene
 at
 the
 table
 of
 a
 Pharisee
 gave
 special
 significance
 to
 the
 warning
 Some
 of
 the
 precepts
 recorded
 in
 connection
 with
 His
 Galilean
 ministry
 were
 here
 repeated
 and
 particular
 stress
 was
 laid
 upon
 the
 superiority
 of
 the
 soul
 to
 the
 body
 and
 of
 eternal
 life
 as
 contrasted
 with
 the
 brief
 duration
 of
 mortal
 existence
 One
 man
 in
 the
 company
 intent
 on
 selfish
 interests
 and
 unable
 to
 see
 beyond
 the
 material
 affairs
 of
 life
 spoke
 out
 saying
 Master
 speak
 to
 my
 brother
 that
 he
 divide
 the
 inheritance
 with
 me
 Jesus
 promptly
 refused
 to
 act
 as
 mediator
 or
 judge
 in
 the
 matter
 Man
 who
 made
 me
 a
 judge
 or
 a
 divider
 over
 you
 was
 the
 Masters
 rejoinder
 The
 wisdom
 underlying
 His
 refusal
 to
 interfere
 is
 apparent
 As
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 guilty
 woman
 who
 had
 been
 brought
 before
 Him
 for
 judgment
 so
 in
 this
 instance
 He
 refrained
 from
 intervention
 in
 matters
 of
 legal
 administration
 An
 opposite
 course
 would
 have
 probably
 involved
 Him
 in
 useless
 disputation
 and
 might
 have
 given
 color
 to
 a
 complaint
 that
 He
 was
 arrogating
 to
 Himself
 the
 functions
 of
 the
 legally
 established
 tribunals
 The
 mans
 appeal
 however
 was
 made
 the
 nucleus
 of
 valuable
 instruction
 his
 clamor
 for
 a
 share
 in
 the
 family
 inheritance
 caused
 Jesus
 to
 say
 Take
 heed
 and
 beware
 of
 covetousness
 for
 a
 mans
 life
 consisteth
 not
 in
 the
 abundance
 of
 the
 things
 which
 he
 possesseth
 This
 combined
 admonition
 and
 profound
 statement
 of
 truth
 was
 emphasized
 by
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Foolish
 Rich
 Man
 Thus
 runs
 the
 story
 The
 ground
 of
 a
 certain
 rich
 man
 brought
 forth
 plentifully
 And
 he
 thought
 within
 himself
 saying
 What
 shall
 I
 do
 because
 I
 have
 no
 room
 where
 to
 bestow
 my
 fruits
 And
 he
 said
 This
 will
 I
 do
 I
 will
 pull
 down
 my
 barns
 and
 build
 greater
 and
 there
 will
 I
 bestow
 all
 my
 fruits
 and
 my
 goods
 And
 I
 will
 say
 to
 my
 soul
 Soul
 thou
 hast
 much
 goods
 laid
 up
 for
 many
 years
 take
 thine
 ease
 eat
 drink
 and
 be
 merry
 But
 God
 said
 unto
 him
 Thou
 fool
 this
 night
 thy
 soul
 shall
 be
 required
 of
 thee
 then
 whose
 shall
 those
 things
 be
 which
 thou
 hast
 provided
 So
 is
 he
 that
 layeth
 up
 treasure
 for
 himself
 and
 is
 not
 rich
 toward
 God
 The
 mans
 abundance
 had
 been
 accumulated
 through
 labor
 and
 thrift
 neglected
 or
 poorlytilled
 fields
 do
 not
 yield
 plentifully
 He
 is
 not
 represented
 as
 one
 in
 possession
 of
 wealth
 not
 rightfully
 his
 own
 His
 plans
 for
 the
 proper
 care
 of
 his
 fruits
 and
 goods
 were
 not
 of
 themselves
 evil
 though
 he
 might
 have
 considered
 better
 ways
 of
 distributing
 his
 surplus
 as
 for
 the
 relief
 of
 the
 needy
 His
 sin
 was
 twofold
 first
 he
 regarded
 his
 great
 store
 chiefly
 as
 the
 means
 of
 securing
 personal
 ease
 and
 sensuous
 indulgence
 secondly
 in
 his
 material
 prosperity
 he
 failed
 to
 acknowledge
 God
 and
 even
 counted
 the
 years
 as
 his
 own
 In
 the
 hour
 of
 his
 selfish
 jubilation
 he
 was
 smitten
 Whether
 the
 voice
 of
 God
 came
 to
 him
 as
 a
 fearsome
 presentiment
 of
 impending
 death
 or
 by
 angel
 messenger
 or
 how
 otherwise
 we
 are
 not
 informed
 but
 the
 voice
 spoke
 his
 doom
 Thou
 fool
 this
 night
 thy
 soul
 shall
 be
 required
 of
 thee
 He
 had
 used
 his
 time
 and
 his
 powers
 of
 body
 and
 mind
 to
 sow
 reap
 and
 garnerall
 for
 himself
 And
 what
 came
 of
 it
 all
 Whose
 should
 be
 the
 wealth
 to
 amass
 which
 he
 had
 jeopardized
 his
 soul
 Had
 he
 been
 other
 than
 a
 fool
 he
 might
 have
 realized
 as
 Solomon
 had
 done
 the
 vanity
 of
 hoarding
 wealth
 for
 another
 and
 he
 perhaps
 of
 uncertain
 character
 to
 possess
 Turning
 to
 the
 disciples
 Jesus
 reiterated
 some
 of
 the
 glorious
 truths
 He
 had
 uttered
 when
 preaching
 on
 the
 mount
 and
 pointed
 to
 the
 birds
 of
 the
 air
 the
 lilies
 and
 grass
 of
 the
 field
 as
 examples
 of
 the
 Fathers
 watchful
 care
 He
 admonished
 His
 hearers
 to
 seek
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 and
 doing
 so
 they
 should
 find
 all
 needful
 things
 added
 Fear
 not
 little
 flock
 He
 added
 in
 tone
 of
 affectionate
 and
 paternal
 regard
 for
 it
 is
 your
 Fathers
 good
 pleasure
 to
 give
 you
 the
 kingdom
 They
 were
 urged
 to
 store
 their
 wealth
 in
 bags
 that
 wax
 not
 old
 containers
 suited
 to
 the
 heavenly
 treasure
 which
 unlike
 the
 goods
 of
 the
 foolish
 rich
 man
 shall
 not
 be
 left
 behind
 when
 the
 soul
 is
 summoned
 The
 man
 whose
 treasure
 is
 of
 earth
 leaves
 it
 all
 at
 death
 he
 whose
 wealth
 is
 in
 heaven
 goes
 to
 his
 own
 and
 death
 is
 but
 the
 portal
 to
 his
 treasury
 The
 disciples
 were
 admonished
 to
 be
 ever
 ready
 waiting
 as
 servants
 wait
 at
 night
 with
 lights
 burning
 for
 their
 masters
 return
 and
 inasmuch
 as
 the
 lord
 of
 the
 household
 comes
 at
 his
 will
 in
 the
 early
 or
 later
 watches
 if
 when
 he
 comes
 he
 finds
 his
 faithful
 servants
 ready
 to
 open
 immediately
 to
 his
 knock
 he
 will
 honor
 them
 as
 they
 deserve
 So
 is
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 to
 come
 perhaps
 when
 least
 expected
 To
 a
 question
 interjected
 by
 Peter
 as
 to
 whether
 this
 parable
 was
 spoken
 to
 the
 Twelve
 only
 or
 to
 all
 Jesus
 made
 no
 direct
 reply
 the
 answer
 however
 was
 conveyed
 in
 the
 continuation
 of
 the
 allegory
 of
 contrast
 between
 faithful
 and
 wicked
 servants
 Who
 then
 is
 that
 faithful
 and
 wise
 steward
 whom
 his
 lord
 shall
 make
 ruler
 over
 his
 household
 to
 give
 them
 their
 portion
 of
 meat
 in
 due
 season
 The
 faithful
 steward
 is
 a
 good
 type
 of
 the
 apostles
 individually
 or
 as
 a
 body
 As
 stewards
 they
 were
 charged
 with
 the
 care
 of
 the
 other
 servants
 and
 of
 the
 household
 and
 as
 to
 them
 more
 had
 been
 given
 than
 to
 the
 others
 so
 of
 them
 more
 would
 be
 required
 and
 they
 would
 be
 held
 to
 strict
 accountability
 for
 their
 stewardship
 The
 Lord
 then
 referred
 feelingly
 to
 His
 own
 mission
 and
 especially
 to
 the
 dreadful
 experiences
 then
 soon
 to
 befall
 Him
 saying
 I
 have
 a
 baptism
 to
 be
 baptised
 with
 and
 how
 am
 I
 straitened
 till
 it
 be
 accomplished
 He
 told
 again
 of
 the
 strife
 and
 dissension
 that
 would
 follow
 the
 preaching
 of
 His
 gospel
 and
 dwelt
 upon
 the
 significance
 of
 then
 current
 events
 To
 those
 who
 ever
 ready
 to
 interpret
 the
 signs
 of
 the
 weather
 yet
 remained
 wilfully
 blind
 to
 the
 important
 developments
 of
 the
 times
 He
 applied
 the
 caustic
 epithet
 hypocrites
 EXCEPT
 YE
 REPENT
 YE
 SHALL
 ALL
 LIKEWISE
 PERISH
 Some
 of
 the
 people
 who
 had
 been
 listening
 to
 our
 Lords
 discourse
 reported
 to
 Him
 the
 circumstances
 of
 a
 tragical
 event
 that
 had
 taken
 place
 probably
 but
 a
 short
 time
 before
 inside
 the
 temple
 walls
 A
 number
 of
 Galileans
 had
 been
 slain
 by
 Roman
 soldiers
 at
 the
 base
 of
 the
 altar
 so
 that
 their
 blood
 had
 mingled
 with
 that
 of
 the
 sacrificial
 victims
 It
 is
 probable
 that
 the
 slaughter
 of
 these
 Galileans
 was
 incident
 to
 some
 violent
 demonstration
 of
 Jewish
 resentment
 against
 Roman
 authority
 which
 the
 procurator
 Pilate
 construed
 as
 an
 incipient
 insurrection
 to
 be
 promptly
 and
 forcibly
 quelled
 Such
 outbursts
 were
 not
 uncommon
 and
 the
 Roman
 tower
 or
 fortress
 of
 Antonia
 had
 been
 erected
 in
 a
 commanding
 position
 overlooking
 the
 temple
 grounds
 and
 connected
 therewith
 by
 a
 wide
 flight
 of
 steps
 so
 that
 soldiers
 could
 have
 ready
 access
 to
 the
 enclosure
 at
 the
 first
 indication
 of
 turmoil
 The
 purpose
 of
 the
 informants
 who
 brought
 this
 matter
 to
 the
 attention
 of
 Jesus
 is
 not
 stated
 but
 we
 find
 probability
 in
 the
 thought
 that
 His
 reference
 to
 the
 signs
 of
 the
 times
 had
 reminded
 them
 of
 the
 tragedy
 and
 that
 they
 were
 inclined
 to
 speculate
 as
 to
 the
 deeper
 significance
 of
 the
 occurrence
 Some
 may
 have
 wondered
 as
 to
 whether
 the
 fate
 of
 the
 Galilean
 victims
 had
 befallen
 them
 as
 a
 merited
 retribution
 Anyway
 to
 some
 such
 conception
 as
 this
 Jesus
 directed
 His
 reply
 By
 question
 and
 answer
 He
 assured
 them
 that
 those
 who
 had
 so
 been
 slain
 were
 not
 to
 be
 considered
 as
 sinners
 above
 other
 Galileans
 But
 said
 He
 except
 ye
 repent
 ye
 shall
 all
 likewise
 perish
 Then
 referring
 on
 His
 own
 initiative
 to
 another
 catastrophe
 He
 cited
 the
 instance
 of
 eighteen
 persons
 who
 had
 been
 killed
 by
 the
 fall
 of
 a
 tower
 at
 Siloam
 and
 affirmed
 that
 these
 were
 not
 to
 be
 counted
 greater
 sinners
 than
 other
 Jerusalemites
 But
 came
 the
 reiteration
 except
 ye
 repent
 ye
 shall
 all
 likewise
 perish
 There
 were
 perhaps
 some
 who
 believed
 that
 the
 men
 upon
 whom
 the
 tower
 had
 fallen
 had
 deserved
 their
 fate
 and
 this
 conception
 is
 the
 more
 probable
 if
 the
 generally
 accepted
 assumption
 be
 correct
 that
 the
 calamity
 came
 upon
 the
 men
 while
 they
 were
 engaged
 under
 Roman
 employ
 in
 work
 on
 the
 aqueduct
 for
 the
 construction
 of
 which
 Pilate
 had
 used
 the
 corban
 or
 sacred
 treasure
 given
 by
 vow
 to
 the
 temple
 It
 is
 not
 mans
 prerogative
 to
 pass
 upon
 the
 purposes
 and
 designs
 of
 God
 nor
 to
 judge
 by
 human
 reason
 alone
 that
 this
 person
 or
 that
 suffers
 disaster
 as
 a
 direct
 result
 of
 individual
 sin
 Nevertheless
 men
 have
 ever
 been
 prone
 to
 so
 judge
 There
 are
 many
 inheritors
 of
 the
 spirit
 of
 Jobs
 friends
 who
 assumed
 his
 guilt
 as
 certain
 because
 of
 the
 great
 misfortunes
 and
 sufferings
 that
 had
 come
 upon
 him
 Even
 while
 Jesus
 spake
 calamity
 dark
 and
 dire
 was
 impending
 over
 temple
 city
 and
 nation
 and
 unless
 the
 people
 would
 repent
 and
 accept
 the
 Messiah
 then
 in
 their
 midst
 the
 decree
 of
 destruction
 would
 be
 carried
 to
 its
 dread
 fulfilment
 Hence
 as
 Jesus
 said
 except
 the
 people
 repented
 they
 should
 perish
 The
 imperative
 need
 of
 reformation
 was
 illustrated
 by
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Barren
 Fig
 Tree
 A
 certain
 man
 had
 a
 fig
 tree
 planted
 in
 his
 vineyard
 and
 he
 came
 and
 sought
 fruit
 thereon
 and
 found
 none
 Then
 said
 he
 unto
 the
 dresser
 of
 his
 vineyard
 Behold
 these
 three
 years
 I
 come
 seeking
 fruit
 on
 this
 fig
 tree
 and
 find
 none
 cut
 it
 down
 why
 cumbereth
 it
 the
 ground
 And
 he
 answering
 said
 unto
 him
 Lord
 let
 it
 alone
 this
 year
 also
 till
 I
 shall
 dig
 about
 it
 and
 dung
 it
 And
 if
 it
 bear
 fruit
 well
 and
 if
 not
 then
 after
 that
 thou
 shalt
 cut
 it
 down
 In
 Jewish
 literature
 particularly
 in
 rabbinical
 lore
 the
 fig
 tree
 is
 of
 frequent
 mention
 as
 a
 symbol
 of
 the
 nation
 The
 warning
 conveyed
 in
 the
 parable
 is
 plain
 the
 element
 of
 possible
 escape
 is
 no
 less
 evident
 If
 the
 fig
 tree
 represents
 the
 covenant
 people
 then
 the
 vineyard
 is
 naturally
 the
 world
 at
 large
 and
 the
 dresser
 of
 the
 vineyard
 is
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 who
 by
 personal
 ministry
 and
 solicitous
 care
 makes
 intercession
 for
 the
 barren
 tree
 in
 the
 hope
 that
 it
 may
 yet
 bear
 fruit
 The
 parable
 is
 of
 universal
 application
 but
 so
 far
 as
 it
 had
 special
 bearing
 upon
 the
 Jewish
 fig
 tree
 of
 that
 time
 it
 was
 attended
 by
 an
 awful
 sequel
 The
 Baptist
 had
 cried
 out
 in
 warning
 that
 the
 ax
 was
 even
 then
 in
 readiness
 and
 every
 unfruitful
 tree
 would
 be
 hewn
 down
 A
 WOMAN
 HEALED
 ON
 THE
 SABBATH
 On
 a
 certain
 Sabbath
 Jesus
 was
 teaching
 in
 a
 synagog
 of
 what
 place
 we
 are
 not
 told
 though
 it
 was
 probably
 in
 one
 of
 the
 towns
 of
 Perea
 There
 was
 present
 a
 woman
 who
 for
 eighteen
 years
 had
 been
 suffering
 from
 an
 infirmity
 that
 had
 so
 drawn
 and
 atrophied
 the
 muscles
 as
 to
 bend
 her
 body
 so
 that
 she
 could
 in
 no
 wise
 straighten
 herself
 Jesus
 called
 her
 to
 Him
 and
 without
 waiting
 for
 petition
 or
 request
 said
 simply
 Woman
 thou
 art
 loosed
 from
 thine
 infirmity
 These
 words
 He
 accompanied
 by
 the
 layingon
 of
 hands
 a
 feature
 of
 His
 healing
 ministrations
 not
 always
 performed
 She
 was
 healed
 forthwith
 and
 stood
 erect
 and
 acknowledging
 the
 source
 of
 the
 power
 by
 which
 she
 had
 been
 released
 from
 her
 bonds
 glorified
 God
 in
 a
 fervent
 prayer
 of
 thanksgiving
 Doubtless
 many
 of
 the
 beholders
 rejoiced
 with
 her
 but
 there
 was
 one
 whose
 soul
 was
 stirred
 by
 indignation
 only
 and
 he
 the
 ruler
 of
 the
 synagog
 Instead
 of
 addressing
 himself
 to
 Jesus
 of
 whose
 power
 he
 may
 have
 been
 afraid
 he
 vented
 his
 ill
 feeling
 upon
 the
 people
 by
 telling
 them
 there
 were
 six
 days
 in
 which
 men
 ought
 to
 work
 and
 that
 on
 those
 days
 they
 who
 wished
 to
 be
 healed
 should
 come
 but
 not
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 The
 rebuke
 was
 ostensibly
 directed
 to
 the
 people
 especially
 to
 the
 woman
 who
 had
 received
 the
 blessing
 but
 in
 reality
 against
 Jesus
 for
 if
 there
 were
 any
 element
 of
 work
 in
 the
 healing
 it
 had
 been
 done
 by
 Him
 not
 by
 the
 woman
 nor
 by
 others
 Upon
 the
 ruler
 of
 the
 synagog
 the
 Lord
 turned
 with
 direct
 address
 Thou
 hypocrite
 doth
 not
 each
 one
 of
 you
 on
 the
 sabbath
 loose
 his
 ox
 or
 his
 ass
 from
 the
 stall
 and
 lead
 him
 away
 to
 watering
 And
 ought
 not
 this
 woman
 being
 a
 daughter
 of
 Abraham
 whom
 Satan
 hath
 bound
 lo
 these
 eighteen
 years
 be
 loosed
 from
 this
 bond
 on
 the
 sabbath
 day
 It
 may
 be
 inferred
 that
 the
 womans
 affliction
 had
 been
 more
 deeply
 seated
 than
 in
 the
 muscles
 for
 Luke
 who
 was
 himself
 a
 physician
 tells
 us
 she
 had
 a
 spirit
 of
 infirmity
 and
 records
 the
 significant
 words
 of
 the
 Lord
 to
 the
 effect
 that
 Satan
 had
 held
 her
 bound
 for
 eighteen
 years
 But
 whatever
 her
 ailment
 whether
 wholly
 physical
 or
 in
 part
 mental
 and
 spiritual
 she
 was
 freed
 from
 her
 bonds
 Again
 was
 the
 Christ
 triumphant
 His
 adversaries
 were
 shamed
 into
 silence
 while
 the
 believers
 rejoiced
 The
 rebuke
 to
 the
 ruler
 of
 the
 synagog
 was
 followed
 by
 a
 brief
 discourse
 in
 which
 Jesus
 gave
 to
 these
 people
 some
 of
 the
 teachings
 before
 delivered
 in
 Galilee
 these
 included
 the
 parables
 of
 the
 mustard
 seed
 and
 the
 leaven
 WILL
 MANY
 OR
 FEW
 BE
 SAVED
 Continuing
 His
 journey
 toward
 Jerusalem
 Jesus
 taught
 in
 many
 of
 the
 cities
 and
 towns
 of
 Perea
 His
 coming
 had
 probably
 been
 announced
 by
 the
 Seventy
 who
 had
 been
 sent
 to
 prepare
 the
 people
 for
 His
 ministry
 One
 of
 those
 who
 had
 been
 impressed
 by
 His
 doctrines
 submitted
 this
 question
 Lord
 are
 there
 few
 that
 be
 saved
 Jesus
 replied
 Strive
 to
 enter
 in
 at
 the
 strait
 gate
 for
 many
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 will
 seek
 to
 enter
 in
 and
 shall
 not
 be
 able
 The
 counsel
 was
 enlarged
 upon
 to
 show
 that
 neglect
 or
 procrastination
 in
 obeying
 the
 requirements
 for
 salvation
 may
 result
 in
 the
 souls
 loss
 When
 the
 door
 is
 shut
 in
 judgment
 many
 will
 come
 knocking
 and
 some
 will
 plead
 that
 they
 had
 known
 the
 Lord
 having
 eaten
 and
 drunk
 in
 His
 company
 and
 that
 He
 had
 taught
 upon
 their
 streets
 but
 to
 them
 who
 had
 failed
 to
 accept
 the
 truth
 when
 offered
 the
 Lord
 shall
 say
 I
 tell
 you
 I
 know
 you
 not
 whence
 ye
 are
 depart
 from
 me
 all
 ye
 workers
 of
 iniquity
 The
 people
 were
 warned
 that
 their
 Israelitish
 lineage
 would
 in
 no
 wise
 save
 them
 for
 many
 who
 were
 not
 of
 the
 covenant
 people
 would
 believe
 and
 be
 saved
 while
 unworthy
 Israelites
 would
 be
 thrust
 out
 So
 is
 it
 that
 There
 are
 last
 which
 shall
 be
 first
 and
 there
 are
 first
 which
 shall
 be
 last
 JESUS
 WARNED
 OF
 HERODS
 DESIGN
 On
 the
 day
 of
 the
 discourse
 last
 noted
 certain
 Pharisees
 came
 to
 Jesus
 with
 this
 warning
 and
 advice
 Get
 thee
 out
 and
 depart
 hence
 for
 Herod
 will
 kill
 thee
 We
 have
 heretofore
 found
 the
 Pharisees
 in
 open
 hostility
 to
 the
 Lord
 or
 secretly
 plotting
 against
 Him
 and
 some
 commentators
 regard
 this
 warning
 as
 another
 evidence
 of
 Pharisaic
 cunningpossibly
 intended
 to
 rid
 the
 province
 of
 Christs
 presence
 or
 designed
 to
 drive
 Him
 toward
 Jerusalem
 where
 He
 would
 be
 again
 within
 easy
 reach
 of
 the
 supreme
 tribunal
 Ought
 we
 not
 to
 be
 liberal
 and
 charitable
 in
 our
 judgment
 as
 to
 the
 intent
 of
 others
 Doubtless
 there
 were
 good
 men
 in
 the
 fraternity
 of
 Pharisees
 and
 those
 who
 came
 informing
 Christ
 of
 a
 plot
 against
 His
 life
 were
 possibly
 impelled
 by
 humane
 motives
 and
 may
 even
 have
 been
 believers
 at
 heart
 That
 Herod
 had
 designs
 against
 our
 Lords
 liberty
 or
 life
 appears
 most
 probable
 in
 the
 answer
 Jesus
 made
 He
 received
 the
 information
 in
 all
 seriousness
 and
 His
 comment
 thereon
 is
 one
 of
 the
 strongest
 of
 His
 utterances
 against
 an
 individual
 Go
 ye
 said
 He
 and
 tell
 that
 fox
 Behold
 I
 cast
 out
 devils
 and
 I
 do
 cures
 to
 day
 and
 to
 morrow
 and
 the
 third
 day
 I
 shall
 be
 perfected
 The
 specifying
 of
 today
 tomorrow
 and
 the
 third
 day
 was
 a
 means
 of
 expressing
 the
 present
 in
 which
 the
 Lord
 was
 then
 acting
 the
 immediate
 future
 in
 which
 He
 would
 continue
 to
 minister
 since
 as
 He
 knew
 the
 day
 of
 His
 death
 was
 yet
 several
 months
 distant
 and
 the
 time
 at
 which
 his
 earthly
 work
 would
 be
 finished
 and
 He
 be
 perfected
 He
 placed
 beyond
 doubt
 the
 fact
 that
 He
 did
 not
 intend
 to
 hasten
 His
 steps
 neither
 cut
 short
 His
 journey
 nor
 cease
 His
 labors
 through
 fear
 of
 Herod
 Antipas
 who
 for
 craft
 and
 cunning
 was
 best
 typified
 by
 a
 sly
 and
 murderous
 fox
 Nevertheless
 it
 was
 Christs
 intention
 to
 go
 on
 and
 soon
 in
 ordinary
 course
 He
 would
 leave
 Perea
 which
 was
 part
 of
 Herods
 domain
 and
 enter
 Judea
 and
 at
 the
 foreknown
 time
 would
 make
 His
 final
 entry
 into
 Jerusalem
 for
 in
 that
 city
 was
 He
 to
 accomplish
 his
 sacrifice
 It
 cannot
 be
 He
 explained
 that
 a
 prophet
 perish
 out
 of
 Jerusalem
 The
 awful
 reality
 that
 He
 the
 Christ
 would
 be
 slain
 in
 the
 chief
 city
 of
 Israel
 wrung
 from
 Him
 the
 pathetic
 apostrophe
 over
 Jerusalem
 which
 was
 repeated
 when
 for
 the
 last
 time
 His
 voice
 was
 heard
 within
 the
 temple
 walls
 NOTES
 TO
 CHAPTER
 
 
 Christs
 Ministry
 Following
 His
 Final
 Withdrawal
 From
 GalileeJohn
 tells
 us
 that
 when
 Jesus
 went
 from
 Galilee
 to
 Jerusalem
 to
 attend
 the
 Feast
 of
 Tabernacles
 He
 went
 not
 openly
 but
 as
 it
 were
 in
 secret
 
 It
 appears
 improbable
 that
 the
 numerous
 works
 recorded
 by
 the
 synoptic
 writers
 as
 features
 of
 our
 Lords
 ministry
 which
 extended
 from
 Galilee
 through
 Perea
 into
 Samaria
 and
 parts
 of
 Judea
 could
 have
 attended
 that
 special
 and
 as
 it
 were
 secret
 journey
 at
 the
 time
 of
 the
 Feast
 of
 Tabernacles
 The
 lack
 of
 agreement
 among
 writers
 as
 to
 the
 sequence
 of
 events
 in
 Christs
 life
 is
 wide
 A
 comparison
 of
 the
 Harmonies
 published
 in
 the
 most
 prominent
 Bible
 Helps
 see
 eg
 Oxford
 and
 Bagster
 Helps
 exemplifies
 these
 divergent
 views
 The
 subjectmatter
 of
 our
 Lords
 teachings
 maintains
 its
 own
 intrinsic
 worth
 irrespective
 of
 merely
 circumstantial
 incidents
 The
 following
 excerpt
 from
 Farrar
 Life
 of
 Christ
 chap
 
 will
 be
 of
 assistance
 to
 the
 student
 who
 should
 bear
 in
 mind
 however
 that
 it
 is
 professedly
 but
 a
 tentative
 or
 possible
 arrangement
 It
 is
 well
 known
 that
 the
 whole
 of
 one
 great
 section
 in
 St
 Lukefrom
 
 to
 forms
 an
 episode
 in
 the
 Gospel
 narrative
 of
 which
 many
 incidents
 are
 narrated
 by
 this
 Evangelist
 alone
 and
 in
 which
 the
 few
 identifications
 of
 time
 and
 place
 all
 point
 to
 one
 slow
 and
 solemn
 progress
 from
 Galilee
 to
 Jerusalem
 
 
 
 
 Now
 after
 the
 Feast
 of
 Dedication
 our
 Lord
 retired
 into
 Perea
 until
 He
 was
 summoned
 thence
 by
 the
 death
 of
 Lazarus
 John
 
 
 
 after
 the
 resurrection
 raising
 of
 Lazarus
 He
 fled
 to
 Ephraim
 
 and
 He
 did
 not
 leave
 His
 retirement
 at
 Ephraim
 until
 He
 went
 to
 Bethany
 six
 days
 before
 His
 final
 Passover
 
 This
 great
 journey
 therefore
 from
 Galilee
 to
 Jerusalem
 so
 rich
 in
 occasions
 which
 called
 forth
 some
 of
 His
 most
 memorable
 utterances
 must
 have
 been
 either
 a
 journey
 to
 the
 Feast
 of
 Tabernacles
 or
 to
 the
 Feast
 of
 Dedication
 That
 it
 could
 not
 have
 been
 the
 former
 may
 be
 regarded
 as
 settled
 not
 only
 on
 other
 grounds
 but
 decisively
 because
 that
 was
 a
 rapid
 and
 secret
 journey
 this
 an
 eminently
 public
 and
 leisurely
 one
 Almost
 every
 inquirer
 seems
 to
 differ
 to
 a
 greater
 or
 less
 degree
 as
 to
 the
 exact
 sequence
 and
 chronology
 of
 the
 events
 which
 follow
 Without
 entering
 into
 minute
 and
 tedious
 disquisitions
 where
 absolute
 certainty
 is
 impossible
 I
 will
 narrate
 this
 period
 of
 our
 Lords
 life
 in
 the
 order
 which
 after
 repeated
 study
 of
 the
 Gospels
 appears
 to
 me
 to
 be
 the
 most
 probable
 and
 in
 the
 separate
 details
 of
 which
 I
 have
 found
 myself
 again
 and
 again
 confirmed
 by
 the
 conclusions
 of
 other
 independent
 inquirers
 And
 here
 I
 will
 only
 premise
 my
 conviction
 
 That
 the
 episode
 of
 St
 Luke
 up
 to
 
 mainly
 refers
 to
 a
 single
 journey
 although
 unity
 of
 subject
 or
 other
 causes
 may
 have
 led
 the
 sacred
 writer
 to
 weave
 into
 his
 narrative
 some
 events
 or
 utterances
 which
 belong
 to
 an
 earlier
 or
 later
 epoch
 
 That
 the
 order
 of
 the
 facts
 narrated
 even
 by
 St
 Luke
 alone
 is
 not
 and
 does
 not
 in
 any
 way
 claim
 to
 be
 strictly
 chronological
 so
 that
 the
 place
 of
 any
 event
 in
 the
 narrative
 by
 no
 means
 necessarily
 indicates
 its
 true
 position
 in
 the
 order
 of
 time
 
 That
 this
 journey
 is
 identical
 with
 that
 which
 is
 partially
 recorded
 in
 Matt
 
 
 Mark
 
 
 That
 as
 seems
 obvious
 from
 internal
 evidence
 the
 events
 narrated
 in
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 Luke
 
 belong
 not
 to
 this
 journey
 but
 to
 the
 last
 which
 Jesus
 ever
 tookthe
 journey
 from
 Ephraim
 to
 Bethany
 and
 Jerusalem
 
 Jesus
 at
 the
 Home
 in
 BethanySome
 writers
 eg
 Edersheim
 place
 this
 incident
 as
 having
 occurred
 in
 the
 course
 of
 our
 Lords
 journey
 to
 Jerusalem
 to
 attend
 the
 Feast
 of
 Tabernacles
 others
 eg
 Geikie
 assume
 that
 it
 took
 place
 immediately
 after
 that
 feast
 and
 yet
 others
 eg
 Farrar
 assign
 it
 to
 the
 eve
 of
 the
 Feast
 of
 Dedication
 nearly
 three
 months
 later
 The
 place
 given
 it
 in
 the
 text
 is
 that
 in
 which
 it
 appears
 in
 the
 scriptural
 record
 
 Shall
 but
 Few
 be
 SavedThrough
 latterday
 revelation
 we
 learn
 that
 graded
 conditions
 await
 us
 in
 the
 hereafter
 and
 that
 beyond
 salvation
 are
 the
 higher
 glories
 of
 exaltation
 The
 specified
 kingdoms
 or
 glories
 of
 the
 redeemed
 excepting
 the
 sons
 of
 perdition
 are
 the
 Celestial
 the
 Terrestrial
 and
 the
 Telestial
 Those
 who
 obtain
 place
 in
 the
 Telestial
 the
 lowest
 of
 the
 three
 are
 shown
 to
 be
 as
 innumerable
 as
 the
 stars
 in
 the
 firmament
 of
 heaven
 or
 as
 the
 sand
 upon
 the
 seashore
 And
 these
 shall
 not
 be
 equal
 For
 they
 shall
 be
 judged
 according
 to
 their
 works
 and
 every
 man
 shall
 receive
 according
 to
 his
 own
 works
 his
 own
 dominion
 in
 the
 mansions
 which
 are
 prepared
 And
 they
 shall
 be
 servants
 of
 the
 Most
 High
 but
 where
 God
 and
 Christ
 dwell
 they
 cannot
 come
 worlds

 CHAPTER
 
 CONTINUATION
 OF
 THE
 PEREAN
 AND
 JUDEAN
 MINISTRY
 IN
 THE
 HOUSE
 OF
 ONE
 OF
 THE
 CHIEF
 PHARISEES
 On
 a
 certain
 Sabbath
 Jesus
 was
 a
 guest
 at
 the
 house
 of
 a
 prominent
 Pharisee
 A
 man
 afflicted
 with
 dropsy
 was
 there
 he
 may
 have
 come
 with
 the
 hope
 of
 receiving
 a
 blessing
 or
 possibly
 his
 presence
 had
 been
 planned
 by
 the
 host
 or
 others
 as
 a
 means
 of
 tempting
 Jesus
 to
 work
 a
 miracle
 on
 the
 holy
 day
 The
 exercize
 of
 our
 Lords
 healing
 power
 was
 at
 least
 thought
 of
 if
 not
 openly
 intimated
 or
 suggested
 for
 we
 read
 that
 Jesus
 answering
 spake
 unto
 the
 lawyers
 and
 Pharisees
 saying
 Is
 it
 lawful
 to
 heal
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 day
 No
 one
 ventured
 to
 reply
 Jesus
 forthwith
 healed
 the
 man
 then
 He
 turned
 to
 the
 assembled
 company
 and
 asked
 Which
 of
 you
 shall
 have
 an
 ass
 or
 an
 ox
 fallen
 into
 a
 pit
 and
 will
 not
 straightway
 pull
 him
 out
 on
 the
 sabbath
 day
 The
 learned
 expositors
 of
 the
 law
 remained
 prudently
 silent
 Observing
 the
 eager
 activity
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 guests
 in
 securing
 for
 themselves
 prominent
 places
 at
 table
 Jesus
 instructed
 them
 in
 a
 matter
 of
 good
 manners
 pointing
 out
 not
 only
 the
 propriety
 but
 the
 advantage
 of
 decent
 selfrestraint
 An
 invited
 guest
 should
 not
 select
 for
 himself
 the
 seat
 of
 honor
 for
 some
 one
 more
 distinguished
 than
 he
 may
 come
 and
 the
 host
 would
 say
 Give
 this
 man
 place
 Better
 is
 it
 to
 take
 a
 lower
 seat
 then
 possibly
 the
 lord
 of
 the
 feast
 may
 say
 Friend
 go
 up
 higher
 The
 moral
 follows
 For
 whosoever
 exalteth
 himself
 shall
 be
 abased
 and
 he
 that
 humbleth
 himself
 shall
 be
 exalted
 This
 festive
 gathering
 at
 the
 house
 of
 the
 chief
 Pharisee
 included
 persons
 of
 prominence
 and
 note
 rich
 men
 and
 officials
 leading
 Pharisees
 renowned
 scholars
 famous
 rabbis
 and
 the
 like
 Looking
 over
 the
 distinguished
 company
 Jesus
 said
 When
 thou
 makest
 a
 dinner
 or
 a
 supper
 call
 not
 thy
 friends
 nor
 thy
 brethren
 neither
 thy
 kinsmen
 nor
 thy
 rich
 neighbours
 lest
 they
 also
 bid
 thee
 again
 and
 a
 recompence
 be
 made
 thee
 But
 when
 thou
 makest
 a
 feast
 call
 the
 poor
 the
 maimed
 the
 lame
 the
 blind
 And
 thou
 shalt
 be
 blessed
 for
 they
 cannot
 recompense
 thee
 for
 thou
 shalt
 be
 recompensed
 at
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 just
 This
 bit
 of
 wholesome
 advice
 was
 construed
 as
 a
 reproof
 and
 some
 one
 attempted
 to
 relieve
 the
 embarrassing
 situation
 by
 exclaiming
 Blessed
 is
 he
 that
 shall
 eat
 bread
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 The
 remark
 was
 an
 allusion
 to
 the
 great
 festival
 which
 according
 to
 Jewish
 traditionalism
 was
 to
 be
 a
 feature
 of
 signal
 importance
 in
 the
 Messianic
 dispensation
 Jesus
 promptly
 turned
 the
 circumstance
 to
 good
 account
 by
 basing
 thereon
 the
 profoundly
 significant
 Parable
 of
 the
 Great
 Supper
 A
 certain
 man
 made
 a
 great
 supper
 and
 bade
 many
 And
 sent
 his
 servant
 at
 supper
 time
 to
 say
 to
 them
 that
 were
 bidden
 Come
 for
 all
 things
 are
 now
 ready
 And
 they
 all
 with
 one
 consent
 began
 to
 make
 excuse
 The
 first
 said
 unto
 him
 I
 have
 bought
 a
 piece
 of
 ground
 and
 I
 must
 needs
 go
 and
 see
 it
 I
 pray
 thee
 have
 me
 excused
 And
 another
 said
 I
 have
 bought
 five
 yoke
 of
 oxen
 and
 I
 go
 to
 prove
 them
 I
 pray
 thee
 have
 me
 excused
 And
 another
 said
 I
 have
 married
 a
 wife
 and
 therefore
 I
 cannot
 come
 So
 that
 servant
 came
 and
 shewed
 his
 lord
 these
 things
 Then
 the
 master
 of
 the
 house
 being
 angry
 said
 to
 his
 servant
 Go
 out
 quickly
 into
 the
 streets
 and
 lanes
 of
 the
 city
 and
 bring
 in
 hither
 the
 poor
 and
 the
 maimed
 and
 the
 halt
 and
 the
 blind
 And
 the
 servant
 said
 Lord
 it
 is
 done
 as
 thou
 hast
 commanded
 and
 yet
 there
 is
 room
 And
 the
 lord
 said
 unto
 the
 servant
 Go
 out
 into
 the
 highways
 and
 hedges
 and
 compel
 them
 to
 come
 in
 that
 my
 house
 may
 be
 filled
 For
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 none
 of
 those
 men
 which
 were
 bidden
 shall
 taste
 of
 my
 supper
 The
 story
 implies
 that
 invitations
 had
 been
 given
 sufficiently
 early
 to
 the
 chosen
 and
 prospective
 guests
 then
 on
 the
 day
 of
 the
 feast
 a
 messenger
 was
 sent
 to
 notify
 them
 again
 as
 was
 the
 custom
 of
 the
 time
 Though
 called
 a
 supper
 the
 meal
 was
 to
 be
 a
 sumptuous
 one
 moreover
 the
 principal
 meal
 of
 the
 day
 was
 commonly
 spoken
 of
 as
 supper
 One
 man
 after
 another
 declined
 to
 attend
 one
 saying
 I
 pray
 thee
 have
 me
 excused
 another
 I
 cannot
 come
 The
 matters
 that
 engaged
 the
 time
 and
 attention
 of
 those
 who
 had
 been
 bidden
 or
 as
 we
 would
 say
 invited
 to
 the
 feast
 were
 not
 of
 themselves
 discreditable
 far
 less
 sinful
 but
 to
 arbitrarily
 allow
 personal
 affairs
 to
 annul
 an
 honorable
 engagement
 once
 accepted
 was
 to
 manifest
 discourtesy
 disrespect
 and
 practical
 insult
 toward
 the
 provider
 of
 the
 feast
 The
 man
 who
 had
 bought
 a
 field
 could
 have
 deferred
 the
 inspection
 he
 who
 had
 just
 purchased
 cattle
 could
 have
 waited
 a
 day
 to
 try
 them
 under
 the
 yoke
 and
 the
 newly
 married
 man
 could
 have
 left
 his
 bride
 and
 his
 friends
 for
 the
 period
 of
 the
 supper
 that
 he
 had
 promised
 to
 attend
 Plainly
 none
 of
 these
 people
 wanted
 to
 be
 present
 The
 master
 of
 the
 house
 was
 justly
 angry
 His
 command
 to
 bring
 in
 the
 poor
 and
 the
 maimed
 the
 halt
 and
 the
 blind
 from
 the
 city
 streets
 must
 have
 appealed
 to
 those
 who
 listened
 to
 our
 Lords
 recital
 as
 a
 reminiscence
 of
 His
 counsel
 given
 a
 few
 minutes
 before
 concerning
 the
 kind
 of
 guests
 a
 rich
 man
 could
 invite
 with
 profit
 to
 his
 soul
 The
 second
 sending
 out
 of
 the
 servant
 this
 time
 into
 the
 highways
 and
 hedges
 outside
 the
 city
 walls
 to
 bring
 in
 even
 the
 country
 poor
 indicated
 boundless
 benevolence
 and
 firm
 determination
 on
 the
 householders
 part
 Explication
 of
 the
 parable
 was
 left
 to
 the
 learned
 men
 to
 whom
 the
 story
 was
 addressed
 Surely
 some
 of
 them
 would
 fathom
 its
 meaning
 in
 part
 at
 least
 The
 covenant
 people
 Israel
 were
 the
 specially
 invited
 guests
 They
 had
 been
 bidden
 long
 enough
 aforetime
 and
 by
 their
 own
 profession
 as
 the
 Lords
 own
 had
 agreed
 to
 be
 partakers
 of
 the
 feast
 When
 all
 was
 ready
 on
 the
 appointed
 day
 they
 were
 severally
 summoned
 by
 the
 Messenger
 who
 had
 been
 sent
 by
 the
 Father
 He
 was
 even
 then
 in
 their
 midst
 But
 the
 cares
 of
 riches
 the
 allurement
 of
 material
 things
 and
 the
 pleasures
 of
 social
 and
 domestic
 life
 had
 engrossed
 them
 and
 they
 prayed
 to
 be
 excused
 or
 irreverently
 declared
 they
 could
 not
 or
 would
 not
 come
 Then
 the
 gladsome
 invitation
 was
 to
 be
 carried
 to
 the
 Gentiles
 who
 were
 looked
 upon
 as
 spiritually
 poor
 maimed
 halt
 and
 blind
 And
 later
 even
 the
 pagans
 beyond
 the
 walls
 strangers
 in
 the
 gates
 of
 the
 holy
 city
 would
 be
 bidden
 to
 the
 supper
 These
 surprized
 at
 the
 unexpected
 summons
 would
 hesitate
 until
 by
 gentle
 urging
 and
 effective
 assurance
 that
 they
 were
 really
 included
 among
 the
 bidden
 guests
 they
 would
 feel
 themselves
 constrained
 or
 compelled
 to
 come
 The
 possibility
 of
 some
 of
 the
 discourteous
 ones
 arriving
 later
 after
 they
 had
 attended
 to
 their
 more
 absorbing
 affairs
 is
 indicated
 in
 the
 Lords
 closing
 words
 For
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 none
 of
 those
 men
 which
 were
 bidden
 shall
 taste
 of
 my
 supper
 COUNTING
 THE
 COST
 As
 had
 been
 in
 Galilee
 so
 was
 it
 in
 Perea
 and
 Judeagreat
 multitudes
 attended
 the
 Master
 whenever
 He
 appeared
 in
 public
 When
 once
 a
 scribe
 has
 presented
 himself
 as
 a
 disciple
 offering
 to
 follow
 wherever
 the
 Master
 led
 Jesus
 had
 indicated
 the
 selfdenial
 privation
 and
 suffering
 incident
 to
 devoted
 service
 with
 the
 result
 that
 the
 mans
 enthusiasm
 was
 soon
 spent
 So
 now
 to
 the
 eager
 multitude
 Jesus
 applied
 a
 test
 of
 sincerity
 He
 would
 have
 only
 genuine
 disciples
 not
 enthusiasts
 of
 a
 day
 ready
 to
 desert
 His
 cause
 when
 effort
 and
 sacrifice
 were
 most
 needed
 Thus
 did
 He
 sift
 the
 people
 If
 any
 man
 come
 to
 me
 and
 hate
 not
 his
 father
 and
 mother
 and
 wife
 and
 children
 and
 brethren
 and
 sisters
 yea
 and
 his
 own
 life
 also
 he
 cannot
 be
 my
 disciple
 And
 whosoever
 doth
 not
 bear
 his
 cross
 and
 come
 after
 me
 cannot
 be
 my
 disciple
 Literal
 hatred
 toward
 ones
 family
 was
 not
 specified
 as
 a
 condition
 of
 discipleship
 indeed
 a
 man
 who
 indulges
 hatred
 or
 any
 other
 evil
 passion
 is
 a
 subject
 for
 repentance
 and
 reformation
 The
 preeminence
 of
 duty
 toward
 God
 over
 personal
 or
 family
 demands
 on
 the
 part
 of
 one
 who
 had
 assumed
 the
 obligations
 of
 a
 disciple
 was
 the
 precept
 As
 Jesus
 pointed
 out
 it
 is
 good
 commonsense
 to
 count
 well
 the
 cost
 before
 one
 enters
 upon
 a
 great
 undertaking
 even
 in
 ordinary
 affairs
 A
 man
 who
 wishes
 to
 build
 say
 a
 tower
 or
 a
 house
 tries
 to
 determine
 before
 he
 begins
 the
 work
 what
 the
 expense
 will
 be
 otherwise
 he
 may
 be
 able
 to
 do
 no
 more
 than
 lay
 the
 foundation
 then
 not
 only
 will
 he
 find
 himself
 a
 loser
 for
 the
 unfinished
 structure
 will
 be
 of
 no
 service
 but
 people
 may
 laugh
 at
 his
 lack
 of
 prudent
 forethought
 So
 also
 a
 king
 finding
 his
 realm
 menaced
 by
 hostile
 invaders
 does
 not
 rush
 into
 battle
 recklessly
 he
 first
 tries
 to
 ascertain
 the
 strength
 of
 the
 enemys
 forces
 and
 then
 if
 the
 odds
 against
 him
 be
 too
 great
 he
 sends
 an
 embassage
 to
 treat
 for
 peace
 So
 likewise
 said
 Jesus
 to
 the
 people
 around
 Him
 whosoever
 he
 be
 of
 you
 that
 forsaketh
 not
 all
 that
 he
 hath
 he
 cannot
 be
 my
 disciple
 All
 who
 entered
 His
 service
 would
 be
 expected
 to
 maintain
 their
 selfsacrificing
 devotion
 He
 wanted
 no
 disciples
 who
 would
 become
 like
 salt
 that
 had
 spoiled
 unsavory
 and
 useless
 He
 that
 hath
 ears
 to
 hear
 let
 him
 hear
 SALVATION
 FOR
 PUBLICANS
 AND
 SINNERSILLUSTRATIVE
 PARABLES
 The
 Pharisees
 in
 Galilee
 had
 intolerantly
 criticized
 Jesus
 because
 of
 His
 friendly
 and
 helpful
 ministry
 among
 the
 publicans
 and
 their
 associates
 who
 were
 disparagingly
 classed
 together
 as
 publicans
 and
 sinners
 He
 had
 replied
 to
 these
 uncharitable
 aspersions
 by
 saying
 that
 a
 physician
 is
 most
 needed
 by
 them
 that
 are
 sick
 and
 that
 He
 had
 come
 to
 call
 sinners
 to
 repentance
 The
 Judean
 Pharisees
 raised
 a
 similar
 complaint
 and
 were
 particularly
 virulent
 when
 they
 saw
 that
 all
 the
 publicans
 and
 sinners
 drew
 near
 to
 hear
 Him
 He
 met
 their
 murmurs
 by
 presenting
 a
 number
 of
 parables
 designed
 to
 show
 the
 incumbent
 duty
 of
 trying
 to
 recover
 the
 lost
 and
 the
 joy
 of
 success
 in
 such
 Godlike
 endeavor
 The
 first
 of
 the
 series
 of
 parables
 was
 that
 of
 the
 Lost
 Sheep
 this
 we
 have
 considered
 in
 connection
 with
 its
 earlier
 delivery
 in
 the
 course
 of
 instruction
 to
 the
 disciples
 in
 Galilee
 Its
 application
 in
 the
 present
 instance
 however
 is
 somewhat
 different
 from
 that
 of
 its
 former
 presentation
 The
 lesson
 on
 this
 later
 occasion
 was
 directed
 to
 the
 selfseeking
 Pharisees
 and
 scribes
 who
 personified
 the
 theocracy
 and
 whose
 bounden
 duty
 it
 should
 have
 been
 to
 care
 for
 the
 strayed
 and
 the
 lost
 If
 the
 publicans
 and
 sinners
 whom
 these
 ecclesiasts
 so
 generally
 contemned
 were
 nearly
 as
 bad
 as
 they
 were
 represented
 to
 be
 if
 they
 were
 men
 who
 had
 broken
 through
 the
 closehedged
 path
 of
 the
 law
 and
 had
 become
 in
 a
 measure
 apostate
 they
 were
 the
 ones
 toward
 whom
 the
 helping
 hand
 of
 missionary
 service
 could
 be
 best
 extended
 In
 no
 instance
 of
 Pharisaic
 slur
 upon
 or
 open
 denunciation
 of
 these
 publicans
 and
 sinners
 do
 we
 find
 Jesus
 defending
 their
 alleged
 evil
 ways
 His
 attitude
 toward
 these
 spiritually
 sick
 folk
 was
 that
 of
 a
 devoted
 physician
 His
 concern
 over
 these
 strayed
 sheep
 was
 that
 of
 a
 loving
 shepherd
 whose
 chief
 desire
 was
 to
 find
 them
 out
 and
 bring
 them
 back
 to
 the
 fold
 This
 neither
 the
 theocracy
 as
 a
 system
 nor
 its
 officials
 as
 individual
 ministers
 even
 attempted
 to
 do
 The
 shepherd
 on
 finding
 the
 sheep
 that
 was
 lost
 thinks
 not
 at
 the
 time
 of
 reprimand
 or
 punishment
 on
 the
 contrary
 when
 he
 hath
 found
 it
 he
 layeth
 it
 on
 his
 shoulders
 rejoicing
 And
 when
 he
 cometh
 home
 he
 calleth
 together
 his
 friends
 and
 neighbours
 saying
 unto
 them
 Rejoice
 with
 me
 for
 I
 have
 found
 my
 sheep
 which
 was
 lost
 A
 direct
 application
 of
 the
 parable
 appears
 in
 the
 Lords
 concise
 address
 to
 the
 Pharisees
 and
 scribes
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 that
 likewise
 joy
 shall
 be
 in
 heaven
 over
 one
 sinner
 that
 repenteth
 more
 than
 over
 ninety
 and
 nine
 just
 persons
 which
 need
 no
 repentance
 Were
 they
 the
 ninety
 and
 nine
 who
 by
 selfestimation
 had
 strayed
 not
 being
 just
 persons
 which
 need
 no
 repentance
 Some
 readers
 say
 they
 catch
 this
 note
 of
 just
 sarcasm
 in
 the
 Masters
 concluding
 words
 In
 the
 earlier
 part
 of
 the
 story
 the
 Lord
 Himself
 appears
 as
 the
 solicitous
 Shepherd
 and
 by
 plain
 implication
 His
 example
 is
 such
 as
 the
 theocratic
 leaders
 ought
 to
 emulate
 Such
 a
 conception
 puts
 the
 Pharisees
 and
 scribes
 in
 the
 position
 of
 shepherds
 rather
 than
 of
 sheep
 Both
 explications
 are
 tenable
 and
 each
 is
 of
 value
 as
 portraying
 the
 status
 and
 duty
 of
 professing
 servants
 of
 the
 Master
 in
 all
 ages
 Without
 break
 in
 the
 narrative
 the
 Lord
 passed
 from
 the
 story
 of
 the
 lost
 sheep
 to
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Lost
 Coin
 Either
 what
 woman
 having
 ten
 pieces
 of
 silver
 if
 she
 lose
 one
 piece
 doth
 not
 light
 a
 candle
 and
 sweep
 the
 house
 and
 seek
 diligently
 till
 she
 find
 it
 And
 when
 she
 hath
 found
 it
 she
 calleth
 her
 friends
 and
 her
 neighbours
 together
 saying
 Rejoice
 with
 me
 for
 I
 have
 found
 the
 piece
 which
 I
 had
 lost
 Likewise
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 there
 is
 joy
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 angels
 of
 God
 over
 one
 sinner
 that
 repenteth
 Between
 this
 parable
 and
 that
 of
 the
 lost
 sheep
 there
 are
 certain
 notable
 differences
 though
 the
 lesson
 in
 each
 is
 in
 general
 the
 same
 The
 sheep
 had
 strayed
 by
 its
 own
 volition
 the
 coin
 had
 been
 dropped
 and
 so
 was
 lost
 as
 a
 result
 of
 inattention
 or
 culpable
 carelessness
 on
 the
 part
 of
 its
 owner
 The
 woman
 discovering
 her
 loss
 institutes
 a
 diligent
 search
 she
 sweeps
 the
 house
 and
 perhaps
 learns
 of
 dirty
 corners
 dusty
 recesses
 cobwebby
 nooks
 to
 which
 she
 had
 been
 oblivious
 in
 her
 selfcomplacency
 as
 an
 outwardly
 clean
 and
 conventional
 housewife
 Her
 search
 is
 rewarded
 by
 the
 recovery
 of
 the
 lost
 piece
 and
 is
 incidentally
 beneficial
 in
 the
 cleansing
 of
 her
 house
 Her
 joy
 is
 like
 that
 of
 the
 shepherd
 wending
 his
 way
 homeward
 with
 the
 sheep
 upon
 his
 shouldersonce
 lost
 but
 now
 regained
 The
 woman
 who
 by
 lack
 of
 care
 lost
 the
 precious
 piece
 may
 be
 taken
 to
 represent
 the
 theocracy
 of
 the
 time
 and
 the
 Church
 as
 an
 institution
 in
 any
 dispensational
 period
 then
 the
 pieces
 of
 silver
 every
 one
 a
 genuine
 coin
 of
 the
 realm
 bearing
 the
 image
 of
 the
 great
 King
 are
 the
 souls
 committed
 to
 the
 care
 of
 the
 Church
 and
 the
 lost
 piece
 symbolizes
 the
 souls
 that
 are
 neglected
 and
 for
 a
 time
 at
 least
 lost
 sight
 of
 by
 the
 authorized
 ministers
 of
 the
 Gospel
 of
 Christ
 These
 cogent
 illustrations
 were
 followed
 by
 one
 yet
 richer
 in
 imagery
 and
 more
 impressively
 elaborate
 in
 detail
 It
 is
 the
 never
 to
 be
 forgotten
 Parable
 of
 the
 Prodigal
 Son
 And
 he
 said
 A
 certain
 man
 had
 two
 sons
 And
 the
 younger
 of
 them
 said
 to
 his
 father
 Father
 give
 me
 the
 portion
 of
 goods
 that
 falleth
 to
 me
 And
 he
 divided
 unto
 them
 his
 living
 And
 not
 many
 days
 after
 the
 younger
 son
 gathered
 all
 together
 and
 took
 his
 journey
 into
 a
 far
 country
 and
 there
 wasted
 his
 substance
 with
 riotous
 living
 And
 when
 he
 had
 spent
 all
 there
 arose
 a
 mighty
 famine
 in
 that
 land
 and
 he
 began
 to
 be
 in
 want
 And
 he
 went
 and
 joined
 himself
 to
 a
 citizen
 of
 that
 country
 and
 he
 sent
 him
 into
 his
 fields
 to
 feed
 swine
 And
 he
 would
 fain
 have
 filled
 his
 belly
 with
 the
 husks
 that
 the
 swine
 did
 eat
 and
 no
 man
 gave
 unto
 him
 And
 when
 he
 came
 to
 himself
 he
 said
 How
 many
 hired
 servants
 of
 my
 fathers
 have
 bread
 enough
 and
 to
 spare
 and
 I
 perish
 with
 hunger
 I
 will
 arise
 and
 go
 to
 my
 father
 and
 will
 say
 unto
 him
 Father
 I
 have
 sinned
 against
 heaven
 and
 before
 thee
 And
 am
 no
 more
 worthy
 to
 be
 called
 thy
 son
 make
 me
 as
 one
 of
 thy
 hired
 servants
 And
 he
 arose
 and
 came
 to
 his
 father
 But
 when
 he
 was
 yet
 a
 great
 way
 off
 his
 father
 saw
 him
 and
 had
 compassion
 and
 ran
 and
 fell
 on
 his
 neck
 and
 kissed
 him
 And
 the
 son
 said
 unto
 him
 Father
 I
 have
 sinned
 against
 heaven
 and
 in
 thy
 sight
 and
 am
 no
 more
 worthy
 to
 be
 called
 thy
 son
 But
 the
 father
 said
 to
 his
 servants
 Bring
 forth
 the
 best
 robe
 and
 put
 it
 on
 him
 and
 put
 a
 ring
 on
 his
 hand
 and
 shoes
 on
 his
 feet
 And
 bring
 hither
 the
 fatted
 calf
 and
 kill
 it
 and
 let
 us
 eat
 and
 be
 merry
 For
 this
 my
 son
 was
 dead
 and
 is
 alive
 again
 he
 was
 lost
 and
 is
 found
 And
 they
 began
 to
 be
 merry
 Now
 his
 elder
 son
 was
 in
 the
 field
 and
 as
 he
 came
 and
 drew
 nigh
 to
 the
 house
 he
 heard
 musick
 and
 dancing
 And
 he
 called
 one
 of
 the
 servants
 and
 asked
 what
 these
 things
 meant
 And
 he
 said
 unto
 him
 Thy
 brother
 is
 come
 and
 thy
 father
 hath
 killed
 the
 fatted
 calf
 because
 he
 hath
 received
 him
 safe
 and
 sound
 And
 he
 was
 angry
 and
 would
 not
 go
 in
 therefore
 came
 his
 father
 out
 and
 intreated
 him
 And
 he
 answering
 said
 to
 his
 father
 Lo
 these
 many
 years
 do
 I
 serve
 thee
 neither
 transgressed
 I
 at
 any
 time
 thy
 commandment
 and
 yet
 thou
 never
 gavest
 me
 a
 kid
 that
 I
 might
 make
 merry
 with
 my
 friends
 But
 as
 soon
 as
 this
 thy
 son
 was
 come
 which
 hath
 devoured
 thy
 living
 with
 harlots
 thou
 hast
 killed
 for
 him
 the
 fatted
 calf
 And
 he
 said
 unto
 him
 Son
 thou
 art
 ever
 with
 me
 and
 all
 that
 I
 have
 is
 thine
 It
 was
 meet
 that
 we
 should
 make
 merry
 and
 be
 glad
 for
 this
 thy
 brother
 was
 dead
 and
 is
 alive
 again
 and
 was
 lost
 and
 is
 found
 The
 demand
 of
 the
 younger
 son
 for
 a
 portion
 of
 the
 patrimony
 even
 during
 his
 fathers
 lifetime
 is
 an
 instance
 of
 deliberate
 and
 unfilial
 desertion
 the
 duties
 of
 family
 cooperation
 had
 grown
 distasteful
 to
 him
 and
 the
 wholesome
 discipline
 of
 the
 home
 had
 become
 irksome
 He
 was
 determined
 to
 break
 away
 from
 all
 home
 ties
 forgetful
 of
 what
 home
 had
 done
 for
 him
 and
 the
 debt
 of
 gratitude
 and
 duty
 by
 which
 he
 was
 morally
 bound
 He
 went
 into
 a
 far
 country
 and
 as
 he
 thought
 beyond
 the
 reach
 of
 the
 fathers
 directing
 influence
 He
 had
 his
 season
 of
 riotous
 living
 of
 unrestrained
 indulgence
 and
 evil
 pleasure
 through
 it
 all
 wasting
 his
 strength
 of
 body
 and
 mind
 and
 squandering
 his
 fathers
 substance
 for
 what
 he
 had
 received
 had
 been
 given
 as
 a
 concession
 and
 not
 as
 the
 granting
 of
 any
 legal
 or
 just
 demand
 Adversity
 came
 upon
 him
 and
 proved
 to
 be
 a
 more
 effective
 minister
 for
 good
 than
 pleasure
 had
 been
 He
 was
 reduced
 to
 the
 lowest
 and
 most
 menial
 service
 that
 of
 herding
 swine
 which
 occupation
 to
 a
 Jew
 was
 the
 extreme
 of
 degradation
 Suffering
 brought
 him
 to
 himself
 He
 the
 son
 of
 honorable
 parentage
 was
 feeding
 pigs
 and
 eating
 with
 them
 while
 even
 the
 hired
 servants
 at
 home
 had
 good
 food
 in
 plenty
 and
 to
 spare
 He
 realized
 not
 alone
 his
 abject
 foolishness
 in
 leaving
 his
 fathers
 wellspread
 table
 to
 batten
 with
 hogs
 but
 the
 unrighteousness
 of
 his
 selfish
 desertion
 he
 was
 not
 only
 remorseful
 but
 repentant
 He
 had
 sinned
 against
 his
 father
 and
 against
 God
 he
 would
 return
 confess
 his
 sin
 and
 ask
 not
 to
 be
 reinstated
 as
 a
 son
 but
 to
 be
 allowed
 to
 work
 as
 a
 hired
 servant
 Having
 resolved
 he
 delayed
 not
 but
 immediately
 set
 out
 to
 find
 his
 long
 way
 back
 to
 home
 and
 father
 The
 father
 became
 aware
 of
 the
 prodigals
 approach
 and
 hastened
 to
 meet
 him
 Without
 a
 word
 of
 condemnation
 the
 loving
 parent
 embraced
 and
 kissed
 the
 wayward
 but
 now
 penitent
 boy
 who
 overcome
 by
 this
 undeserved
 affection
 humbly
 acknowledged
 his
 error
 and
 sorrowfully
 confessed
 that
 he
 was
 not
 worthy
 to
 be
 known
 as
 his
 fathers
 son
 It
 is
 noteworthy
 that
 in
 his
 contrite
 confession
 he
 did
 not
 ask
 to
 be
 accepted
 as
 a
 hired
 servant
 as
 he
 had
 resolved
 to
 do
 the
 fathers
 joy
 was
 too
 sacred
 to
 be
 thus
 marred
 he
 would
 please
 his
 father
 best
 by
 placing
 himself
 unreservedly
 at
 that
 fathers
 disposal
 The
 rough
 garb
 of
 poverty
 was
 discarded
 for
 the
 best
 robe
 a
 ring
 was
 placed
 on
 his
 finger
 as
 a
 mark
 of
 reinstatement
 shoes
 told
 of
 restored
 sonship
 not
 of
 employment
 as
 a
 hired
 servant
 The
 fathers
 glad
 heart
 could
 express
 itself
 only
 in
 acts
 of
 abundant
 kindness
 a
 feast
 was
 made
 ready
 for
 was
 not
 the
 son
 once
 counted
 as
 dead
 now
 alive
 Had
 not
 the
 lost
 been
 found
 again
 So
 far
 the
 story
 sustains
 a
 relation
 of
 close
 analogy
 to
 the
 two
 parables
 that
 preceded
 it
 in
 the
 same
 discourse
 the
 part
 following
 introduces
 another
 important
 symbolism
 No
 one
 had
 complained
 at
 the
 recovery
 of
 the
 stray
 sheep
 nor
 at
 the
 finding
 of
 the
 lost
 coin
 friends
 had
 rejoiced
 with
 the
 finder
 in
 each
 case
 But
 the
 fathers
 happiness
 at
 the
 return
 of
 the
 prodigal
 was
 interrupted
 by
 the
 grumbling
 protest
 of
 the
 elder
 son
 He
 on
 approaching
 the
 house
 had
 observed
 the
 evidences
 of
 festal
 joy
 and
 instead
 of
 entering
 as
 was
 his
 right
 had
 inquired
 of
 one
 of
 the
 servants
 as
 to
 the
 cause
 of
 the
 unusual
 rejoicing
 On
 learning
 that
 his
 brother
 had
 returned
 and
 that
 the
 father
 had
 prepared
 a
 festival
 in
 honor
 of
 the
 event
 this
 elder
 son
 grew
 angry
 and
 churlishly
 refused
 to
 enter
 the
 house
 even
 after
 his
 father
 had
 come
 out
 and
 entreated
 him
 He
 cited
 his
 own
 faithfulness
 and
 devotion
 to
 the
 routine
 labor
 of
 the
 farm
 to
 which
 claim
 of
 excellence
 the
 father
 did
 not
 demur
 but
 the
 son
 and
 heir
 reproached
 his
 father
 for
 having
 failed
 to
 give
 him
 so
 much
 as
 a
 kid
 with
 which
 to
 make
 merry
 with
 his
 friends
 while
 now
 that
 the
 wayward
 and
 spendthrift
 son
 had
 come
 back
 the
 father
 had
 killed
 for
 him
 even
 the
 fatted
 calf
 There
 is
 significance
 in
 the
 elder
 ones
 designation
 of
 the
 penitent
 as
 this
 thy
 son
 rather
 than
 my
 brother
 The
 elder
 son
 deafened
 by
 selfish
 anger
 refused
 to
 hear
 aright
 the
 affectionate
 assurance
 Son
 thou
 art
 ever
 with
 me
 and
 all
 that
 I
 have
 is
 thine
 and
 with
 heart
 hardened
 by
 unbrotherly
 resentment
 he
 stood
 unmoved
 by
 the
 emotional
 and
 loving
 outburst
 this
 thy
 brother
 was
 dead
 and
 is
 alive
 again
 and
 was
 lost
 and
 is
 found
 We
 are
 not
 justified
 in
 extolling
 the
 virtue
 of
 repentance
 on
 the
 part
 of
 the
 prodigal
 above
 the
 faithful
 plodding
 service
 of
 his
 brother
 who
 had
 remained
 at
 home
 true
 to
 the
 duties
 required
 of
 him
 The
 devoted
 son
 was
 the
 heir
 the
 father
 did
 not
 disparage
 his
 worth
 nor
 deny
 his
 deserts
 His
 displeasure
 over
 the
 rejoicing
 incident
 to
 the
 return
 of
 his
 wayward
 brother
 was
 an
 exhibition
 of
 illiberality
 and
 narrowness
 but
 of
 the
 two
 brothers
 the
 elder
 was
 the
 more
 faithful
 whatever
 his
 minor
 defects
 may
 have
 been
 The
 particular
 point
 emphasized
 in
 the
 Lords
 lesson
 however
 had
 to
 do
 with
 his
 uncharitable
 and
 selfish
 weaknesses
 Pharisees
 and
 scribes
 to
 whom
 this
 masterpiece
 of
 illustrative
 incident
 was
 delivered
 must
 have
 taken
 to
 themselves
 its
 personal
 application
 They
 were
 typified
 by
 the
 elder
 son
 laboriously
 attentive
 to
 routine
 methodically
 plodding
 by
 rule
 and
 rote
 in
 the
 multifarious
 labors
 of
 the
 field
 without
 interest
 except
 that
 of
 self
 and
 all
 unwilling
 to
 welcome
 a
 repentant
 publican
 or
 a
 returned
 sinner
 From
 all
 such
 they
 were
 estranged
 such
 a
 one
 might
 be
 to
 the
 indulgent
 and
 forgiving
 Father
 this
 thy
 son
 but
 never
 to
 them
 a
 brother
 They
 cared
 not
 who
 or
 how
 many
 were
 lost
 so
 long
 as
 they
 were
 undisturbed
 in
 heirship
 and
 possession
 by
 the
 return
 of
 penitent
 prodigals
 But
 the
 parable
 was
 not
 for
 them
 alone
 it
 is
 a
 living
 perennial
 yielding
 the
 fruit
 of
 wholesome
 doctrine
 and
 soulsustaining
 nourishment
 for
 all
 time
 Not
 a
 word
 appears
 in
 condonation
 or
 excuse
 for
 the
 prodigals
 sin
 upon
 that
 the
 Father
 could
 not
 look
 with
 the
 least
 degree
 of
 allowance
 but
 over
 that
 sinners
 repentance
 and
 contrition
 of
 soul
 God
 and
 the
 household
 of
 heaven
 rejoiced
 The
 three
 parables
 which
 appear
 in
 the
 scriptural
 record
 as
 parts
 of
 a
 continuous
 discourse
 are
 as
 one
 in
 portraying
 the
 joy
 that
 abounds
 in
 heaven
 over
 the
 recovery
 of
 a
 soul
 once
 numbered
 among
 the
 lost
 whether
 that
 soul
 be
 best
 symbolized
 by
 a
 sheep
 that
 had
 wandered
 afar
 a
 coin
 that
 had
 dropped
 out
 of
 sight
 through
 the
 custodians
 neglect
 or
 a
 son
 who
 would
 deliberately
 sever
 himself
 from
 home
 and
 heaven
 There
 is
 no
 justification
 for
 the
 inference
 that
 a
 repentant
 sinner
 is
 to
 be
 given
 precedence
 over
 a
 righteous
 soul
 who
 has
 resisted
 sin
 were
 such
 the
 way
 of
 God
 then
 Christ
 the
 one
 sinless
 Man
 would
 be
 surpassed
 in
 the
 Fathers
 esteem
 by
 regenerate
 offenders
 Unqualifiedly
 offensive
 as
 is
 sin
 the
 sinner
 is
 yet
 precious
 in
 the
 Fathers
 eyes
 because
 of
 the
 possibility
 of
 his
 repentance
 and
 return
 to
 righteousness
 The
 loss
 of
 a
 soul
 is
 a
 very
 real
 and
 a
 very
 great
 loss
 to
 God
 He
 is
 pained
 and
 grieved
 thereby
 for
 it
 is
 His
 will
 that
 not
 one
 should
 perish
 DISCIPLES
 INSTRUCTED
 BY
 PARABLE
 Addressing
 Himself
 more
 directly
 to
 the
 disciples
 present
 who
 on
 this
 occasion
 probably
 comprized
 in
 addition
 to
 the
 apostles
 many
 believers
 including
 even
 some
 of
 the
 publicans
 Jesus
 spake
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Unrighteous
 Steward
 And
 he
 said
 also
 unto
 his
 disciples
 There
 was
 a
 certain
 rich
 man
 which
 had
 a
 steward
 and
 the
 same
 was
 accused
 unto
 him
 that
 he
 had
 wasted
 his
 goods
 And
 he
 called
 him
 and
 said
 unto
 him
 How
 is
 it
 that
 I
 hear
 this
 of
 thee
 give
 an
 account
 of
 thy
 stewardship
 for
 thou
 mayest
 be
 no
 longer
 steward
 Then
 the
 steward
 said
 within
 himself
 What
 shall
 I
 do
 for
 my
 lord
 taketh
 away
 from
 me
 the
 stewardship
 I
 cannot
 dig
 to
 beg
 I
 am
 ashamed
 I
 am
 resolved
 what
 to
 do
 that
 when
 I
 am
 put
 out
 of
 the
 stewardship
 they
 may
 receive
 me
 into
 their
 houses
 So
 he
 called
 every
 one
 of
 his
 lords
 debtors
 unto
 him
 and
 said
 unto
 the
 first
 How
 much
 owest
 thou
 unto
 my
 lord
 And
 he
 said
 An
 hundred
 measures
 of
 oil
 And
 he
 said
 unto
 him
 Take
 thy
 bill
 and
 sit
 down
 quickly
 and
 write
 fifty
 Then
 said
 he
 to
 another
 And
 how
 much
 owest
 thou
 And
 he
 said
 An
 hundred
 measures
 of
 wheat
 And
 he
 said
 unto
 him
 Take
 thy
 bill
 and
 write
 fourscore
 And
 the
 lord
 commended
 the
 unjust
 steward
 because
 he
 had
 done
 wisely
 for
 the
 children
 of
 this
 world
 are
 in
 their
 generation
 wiser
 than
 the
 children
 of
 light
 The
 three
 preceding
 parables
 show
 forth
 their
 lessons
 through
 the
 relationship
 of
 close
 analogy
 and
 intimate
 similarities
 this
 one
 teaches
 rather
 by
 its
 contrast
 of
 situations
 The
 steward
 in
 the
 story
 was
 the
 duly
 authorized
 agent
 of
 his
 employer
 holding
 what
 we
 would
 call
 the
 powerofattorney
 to
 act
 in
 his
 masters
 name
 He
 was
 called
 to
 account
 because
 a
 report
 of
 his
 wastefulness
 and
 lack
 of
 care
 had
 reached
 the
 masters
 ears
 The
 steward
 did
 not
 deny
 his
 guilt
 and
 forthwith
 he
 received
 notice
 of
 dismissal
 Considerable
 time
 would
 be
 required
 for
 making
 up
 his
 accounts
 preparatory
 to
 turning
 the
 stewardship
 over
 to
 his
 successor
 This
 interval
 during
 which
 he
 remained
 in
 authority
 he
 determined
 to
 use
 so
 far
 as
 possible
 to
 his
 own
 advantage
 even
 though
 he
 wrought
 further
 injustice
 to
 his
 masters
 interests
 He
 contemplated
 the
 condition
 of
 dependence
 in
 which
 he
 would
 soon
 find
 himself
 Through
 unthrift
 and
 extravagance
 he
 had
 failed
 to
 lay
 by
 any
 store
 from
 his
 earnings
 he
 had
 wasted
 his
 own
 and
 his
 lords
 substance
 He
 felt
 that
 he
 was
 unfit
 for
 hard
 manual
 labor
 and
 he
 would
 be
 ashamed
 to
 beg
 particularly
 in
 the
 community
 in
 which
 he
 had
 been
 a
 lavish
 spender
 and
 a
 man
 of
 influence
 With
 the
 desire
 to
 put
 others
 under
 some
 obligation
 to
 himself
 so
 that
 when
 he
 was
 deposed
 he
 could
 the
 more
 effectively
 appeal
 to
 them
 he
 called
 his
 lords
 debtors
 and
 authorized
 them
 to
 change
 their
 bonds
 bills
 of
 sale
 or
 notes
 of
 hand
 so
 as
 to
 show
 a
 greatly
 decreased
 indebtedness
 Without
 doubt
 these
 acts
 were
 unrighteous
 he
 defrauded
 his
 employer
 and
 enriched
 the
 debtors
 through
 whom
 he
 hoped
 to
 be
 benefited
 Most
 of
 us
 are
 surprized
 to
 know
 that
 the
 master
 learning
 what
 his
 farseeing
 though
 selfish
 and
 dishonest
 steward
 had
 done
 condoned
 the
 offense
 and
 actually
 commended
 him
 for
 his
 foresight
 because
 he
 had
 done
 wisely
 as
 our
 version
 reads
 or
 because
 he
 had
 done
 prudently
 as
 many
 scholars
 aver
 to
 be
 the
 better
 rendering
 In
 pointing
 the
 moral
 of
 the
 parable
 Jesus
 said
 For
 the
 children
 of
 this
 world
 are
 in
 their
 generation
 wiser
 than
 the
 children
 of
 light
 And
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Make
 to
 yourselves
 friends
 of
 the
 mammon
 of
 unrighteousness
 that
 when
 ye
 fail
 they
 may
 receive
 you
 into
 everlasting
 habitations
 Our
 Lords
 purpose
 was
 to
 show
 the
 contrast
 between
 the
 care
 thoughtfulness
 and
 devotion
 of
 men
 engaged
 in
 the
 moneymaking
 affairs
 of
 earth
 and
 the
 half
 hearted
 ways
 of
 many
 who
 are
 professedly
 striving
 after
 spiritual
 riches
 Worldlyminded
 men
 do
 not
 neglect
 provision
 for
 their
 future
 years
 and
 often
 are
 sinfully
 eager
 to
 amass
 plenty
 while
 the
 children
 of
 light
 or
 those
 who
 believe
 spiritual
 wealth
 to
 be
 above
 all
 earthly
 possessions
 are
 less
 energetic
 prudent
 or
 wise
 By
 mammon
 of
 unrighteousness
 we
 may
 understand
 material
 wealth
 or
 worldly
 things
 While
 far
 inferior
 to
 the
 treasures
 of
 heaven
 money
 or
 that
 which
 it
 represents
 may
 be
 the
 means
 of
 accomplishing
 good
 and
 of
 furthering
 the
 purposes
 of
 God
 Our
 Lords
 admonition
 was
 to
 utilize
 mammon
 in
 good
 works
 while
 it
 lasted
 for
 some
 day
 it
 shall
 fail
 and
 only
 the
 results
 achieved
 through
 its
 use
 shall
 endure
 If
 the
 wicked
 steward
 when
 cast
 out
 from
 his
 masters
 house
 because
 of
 unworthiness
 might
 hope
 to
 be
 received
 into
 the
 homes
 of
 these
 whom
 he
 had
 favored
 how
 much
 more
 confidently
 may
 they
 who
 are
 genuinely
 devoted
 to
 the
 right
 hope
 to
 be
 received
 into
 the
 everlasting
 mansions
 of
 God
 Such
 seems
 to
 be
 part
 of
 the
 lesson
 It
 was
 not
 the
 stewards
 dishonesty
 that
 was
 extolled
 his
 prudence
 and
 foresight
 were
 commended
 however
 for
 while
 he
 misapplied
 his
 masters
 substance
 he
 gave
 relief
 to
 the
 debtors
 and
 in
 so
 doing
 he
 did
 not
 exceed
 his
 legal
 powers
 for
 he
 was
 still
 steward
 though
 he
 was
 morally
 guilty
 of
 malfeasance
 The
 lesson
 may
 be
 summed
 up
 in
 this
 wise
 Make
 such
 use
 of
 your
 wealth
 as
 shall
 insure
 you
 friends
 hereafter
 Be
 diligent
 for
 the
 day
 in
 which
 you
 can
 use
 your
 earthly
 riches
 will
 soon
 pass
 Take
 a
 lesson
 from
 even
 the
 dishonest
 and
 the
 evil
 if
 they
 are
 so
 prudent
 as
 to
 provide
 for
 the
 only
 future
 they
 think
 of
 how
 much
 more
 should
 you
 who
 believe
 in
 an
 eternal
 future
 provide
 therefor
 If
 you
 have
 not
 learned
 wisdom
 and
 prudence
 in
 the
 use
 of
 unrighteous
 mammon
 how
 can
 you
 be
 trusted
 with
 the
 more
 enduring
 riches
 If
 you
 have
 not
 learned
 how
 to
 use
 properly
 the
 wealth
 of
 another
 which
 has
 been
 committed
 to
 you
 as
 steward
 how
 can
 you
 expect
 to
 be
 successful
 in
 the
 handling
 of
 great
 wealth
 should
 such
 be
 given
 you
 as
 your
 own
 Emulate
 the
 unjust
 steward
 and
 the
 lovers
 of
 mammon
 not
 in
 their
 dishonesty
 cupidity
 and
 miserly
 hoarding
 of
 the
 wealth
 that
 is
 at
 best
 but
 transitory
 but
 in
 their
 zeal
 forethought
 and
 provision
 for
 the
 future
 Moreover
 let
 not
 wealth
 become
 your
 master
 keep
 it
 to
 its
 place
 as
 a
 servant
 for
 No
 servant
 can
 serve
 two
 masters
 for
 either
 he
 will
 hate
 the
 one
 and
 love
 the
 other
 or
 else
 he
 will
 hold
 to
 the
 one
 and
 despise
 the
 other
 Ye
 cannot
 serve
 God
 and
 mammon
 DERISION
 OF
 THE
 PHARISEES
 MET
 ANOTHER
 ILLUSTRATIVE
 PARABLES
 The
 Pharisees
 who
 were
 covetous
 or
 more
 precisely
 stated
 who
 were
 lovers
 of
 money
 overheard
 the
 foregoing
 instructions
 to
 the
 disciples
 and
 openly
 scoffed
 at
 the
 Teacher
 and
 the
 lesson
 What
 did
 this
 Galilean
 who
 owned
 nothing
 but
 the
 clothes
 He
 wore
 know
 about
 money
 or
 the
 best
 way
 of
 administering
 wealth
 Our
 Lords
 reply
 to
 their
 words
 of
 derision
 was
 a
 further
 condemnation
 They
 knew
 all
 the
 tricks
 of
 the
 businessworld
 and
 could
 outdo
 the
 unrighteous
 steward
 in
 crafty
 manipulation
 and
 yet
 so
 successfully
 could
 they
 justify
 themselves
 before
 men
 as
 to
 be
 outwardly
 honest
 and
 straightforward
 furthermore
 they
 made
 ostentatious
 display
 of
 a
 certain
 type
 of
 simplicity
 plainness
 and
 selfdenial
 in
 which
 external
 observances
 they
 asserted
 superiority
 over
 the
 luxuryloving
 Sadducees
 they
 had
 grown
 arrogantly
 proud
 of
 their
 humility
 but
 God
 knew
 their
 hearts
 and
 the
 traits
 and
 practises
 they
 most
 esteemed
 were
 an
 abomination
 in
 His
 sight
 They
 posed
 as
 custodians
 of
 the
 law
 and
 expounders
 of
 the
 prophets
 The
 law
 and
 the
 prophets
 had
 been
 in
 force
 until
 the
 Baptists
 time
 since
 which
 the
 gospel
 of
 the
 kingdom
 had
 been
 preached
 and
 people
 were
 eager
 to
 enter
 it
 though
 the
 theocracy
 strove
 mightily
 to
 prevent
 The
 law
 had
 not
 been
 invalidated
 easier
 were
 it
 that
 heaven
 and
 earth
 pass
 away
 than
 that
 one
 tittle
 of
 the
 law
 fail
 of
 fulfilment
 yet
 those
 Pharisees
 and
 scribes
 had
 tried
 to
 nullify
 the
 law
 In
 the
 matter
 of
 divorce
 for
 example
 they
 by
 their
 unlawful
 additions
 and
 false
 interpretations
 had
 condoned
 even
 the
 sin
 of
 adultery
 The
 Master
 gave
 as
 a
 further
 lesson
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Rich
 Man
 and
 Lazarus
 There
 was
 a
 certain
 rich
 man
 which
 was
 clothed
 in
 purple
 and
 fine
 linen
 and
 fared
 sumptuously
 every
 day
 And
 there
 was
 a
 certain
 beggar
 named
 Lazarus
 which
 was
 laid
 at
 his
 gate
 full
 of
 sores
 And
 desiring
 to
 be
 fed
 with
 the
 crumbs
 which
 fell
 from
 the
 rich
 mans
 table
 moreover
 the
 dogs
 came
 and
 licked
 his
 sores
 And
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 that
 the
 beggar
 died
 and
 was
 carried
 by
 the
 angels
 into
 Abrahams
 bosom
 the
 rich
 man
 also
 died
 and
 was
 buried
 And
 in
 hell
 he
 lift
 up
 his
 eyes
 being
 in
 torments
 and
 seeth
 Abraham
 afar
 off
 and
 Lazarus
 in
 his
 bosom
 And
 he
 cried
 and
 said
 Father
 Abraham
 have
 mercy
 on
 me
 and
 send
 Lazarus
 that
 he
 may
 dip
 the
 tip
 of
 his
 finger
 in
 water
 and
 cool
 my
 tongue
 for
 I
 am
 tormented
 in
 this
 flame
 But
 Abraham
 said
 Son
 remember
 that
 thou
 in
 thy
 lifetime
 receivedst
 thy
 good
 things
 and
 likewise
 Lazarus
 evil
 things
 but
 now
 he
 is
 comforted
 and
 thou
 art
 tormented
 And
 beside
 all
 this
 between
 us
 and
 you
 there
 is
 a
 great
 gulf
 fixed
 so
 that
 they
 which
 would
 pass
 from
 hence
 to
 you
 cannot
 neither
 can
 they
 pass
 to
 us
 that
 would
 come
 from
 thence
 Then
 he
 said
 I
 pray
 thee
 therefore
 father
 that
 thou
 wouldest
 send
 him
 to
 my
 fathers
 house
 For
 I
 have
 five
 brethren
 that
 he
 may
 testify
 unto
 them
 lest
 they
 also
 come
 into
 this
 place
 of
 torment
 Abraham
 saith
 unto
 him
 They
 have
 Moses
 and
 the
 prophets
 let
 them
 hear
 them
 And
 he
 said
 Nay
 father
 Abraham
 but
 if
 one
 went
 unto
 them
 from
 the
 dead
 they
 will
 repent
 And
 he
 said
 unto
 him
 If
 they
 hear
 not
 Moses
 and
 the
 prophets
 neither
 will
 they
 be
 persuaded
 though
 one
 rose
 from
 the
 dead
 The
 afflicted
 beggar
 is
 honored
 with
 a
 name
 the
 other
 is
 designated
 simply
 as
 a
 certain
 rich
 man
 The
 two
 are
 presented
 as
 the
 extremes
 of
 contrast
 between
 wealth
 and
 destitution
 The
 rich
 man
 was
 clothed
 in
 the
 costliest
 attire
 purple
 and
 fine
 linen
 and
 his
 everyday
 fare
 was
 a
 sumptuous
 feast
 Lazarus
 had
 been
 brought
 to
 the
 gates
 of
 the
 rich
 mans
 palace
 and
 there
 left
 a
 helpless
 mendicant
 his
 body
 covered
 with
 sores
 The
 rich
 man
 was
 attended
 by
 servitors
 ready
 to
 gratify
 his
 slightest
 desire
 the
 poor
 beggar
 at
 his
 gates
 had
 neither
 companions
 nor
 attendants
 except
 the
 dogs
 which
 like
 himself
 waited
 for
 the
 refuse
 from
 the
 rich
 mans
 table
 Such
 is
 the
 picture
 of
 the
 two
 in
 life
 An
 abrupt
 change
 of
 scene
 brings
 into
 view
 the
 same
 two
 on
 the
 far
 side
 of
 the
 veil
 that
 hangs
 between
 the
 here
 and
 the
 hereafter
 Lazarus
 died
 no
 mention
 is
 made
 of
 his
 funeral
 his
 festering
 body
 was
 probably
 thrown
 into
 a
 paupers
 grave
 but
 angels
 bore
 his
 immortal
 spirit
 into
 Paradise
 the
 resting
 place
 of
 the
 blessed
 and
 commonly
 known
 in
 the
 figurative
 lore
 of
 the
 rabbis
 as
 Abrahams
 bosom
 The
 rich
 man
 also
 died
 his
 burial
 was
 doubtless
 an
 elaborate
 affair
 but
 we
 read
 not
 of
 any
 angelic
 escort
 receiving
 his
 spirit
 In
 hell
 he
 lifted
 up
 his
 eyes
 and
 saw
 afar
 Lazarus
 at
 peace
 in
 the
 abode
 of
 Abraham
 As
 a
 Jew
 the
 man
 had
 often
 boasted
 of
 having
 Abraham
 for
 his
 father
 and
 now
 the
 wretched
 spirit
 appealed
 to
 the
 patriarch
 of
 his
 race
 by
 the
 paternal
 address
 Father
 Abraham
 and
 asked
 only
 the
 boon
 of
 a
 single
 drop
 of
 water
 to
 be
 placed
 on
 his
 parched
 tongue
 this
 he
 prayed
 that
 Lazarus
 the
 erstwhile
 beggar
 might
 bring
 The
 reply
 throws
 light
 on
 certain
 conditions
 existing
 in
 the
 spirit
 world
 though
 as
 in
 the
 use
 of
 parables
 generally
 the
 presentation
 is
 largely
 figurative
 Addressing
 the
 poor
 tormented
 spirit
 as
 Son
 Abraham
 reminded
 him
 of
 all
 the
 good
 things
 he
 had
 kept
 for
 himself
 on
 earth
 whilst
 Lazarus
 had
 lain
 a
 suffering
 neglected
 beggar
 at
 his
 gates
 now
 by
 the
 operation
 of
 divine
 law
 Lazarus
 had
 received
 recompense
 and
 he
 retribution
 Moreover
 to
 grant
 his
 pitiful
 request
 was
 impossible
 for
 between
 the
 abode
 of
 the
 righteous
 where
 Lazarus
 rested
 and
 that
 of
 the
 wicked
 where
 he
 suffered
 there
 is
 a
 great
 gulf
 fixed
 and
 passage
 between
 the
 two
 is
 interdicted
 The
 next
 request
 of
 the
 miserable
 sufferer
 was
 not
 wholly
 selfish
 in
 his
 anguish
 he
 remembered
 those
 from
 whom
 he
 had
 been
 separated
 by
 death
 fain
 would
 he
 save
 his
 brothers
 from
 the
 fate
 he
 had
 met
 and
 he
 prayed
 that
 Lazarus
 be
 sent
 back
 to
 earth
 to
 visit
 the
 ancestral
 home
 and
 warn
 those
 selfish
 pleasureseeking
 and
 yet
 mortal
 brothers
 of
 the
 awful
 doom
 awaiting
 them
 except
 they
 would
 repent
 and
 reform
 There
 may
 have
 been
 in
 this
 petition
 an
 insinuation
 that
 had
 he
 been
 sufficiently
 warned
 he
 would
 have
 done
 better
 and
 would
 have
 escaped
 the
 torment
 To
 the
 reminder
 that
 they
 had
 the
 words
 of
 Moses
 and
 the
 prophets
 which
 they
 should
 obey
 he
 replied
 that
 if
 one
 went
 to
 them
 from
 the
 dead
 they
 would
 surely
 repent
 Abraham
 answered
 that
 if
 they
 would
 not
 heed
 Moses
 and
 the
 prophets
 neither
 would
 they
 be
 persuaded
 though
 one
 rose
 from
 the
 dead
 In
 any
 attempt
 to
 interpret
 the
 parable
 as
 a
 whole
 or
 definitely
 apply
 any
 of
 its
 parts
 we
 should
 bear
 in
 mind
 that
 it
 was
 addressed
 to
 the
 Pharisees
 as
 an
 instructive
 rebuke
 for
 the
 derision
 and
 scorn
 with
 which
 they
 had
 received
 the
 Lords
 warning
 concerning
 the
 dangers
 attending
 servitude
 to
 mammon
 Jesus
 employed
 Jewish
 metaphors
 and
 the
 imagery
 of
 the
 parable
 is
 such
 as
 would
 most
 directly
 appeal
 to
 the
 official
 expounders
 of
 Moses
 and
 the
 prophets
 While
 as
 a
 practise
 it
 would
 be
 critically
 unfair
 to
 deduce
 doctrinal
 principles
 from
 parabolic
 incidents
 we
 cannot
 admit
 that
 Christ
 would
 teach
 falsely
 even
 in
 parable
 and
 therefore
 we
 accept
 as
 true
 the
 portrayal
 of
 conditions
 in
 the
 world
 of
 the
 disembodied
 That
 righteous
 and
 unrighteous
 dwell
 apart
 during
 the
 interval
 between
 death
 and
 resurrection
 is
 clear
 Paradise
 or
 as
 the
 Jews
 like
 to
 designate
 that
 blessed
 abode
 Abrahams
 bosom
 is
 not
 the
 place
 of
 final
 glory
 any
 more
 than
 the
 hell
 to
 which
 the
 rich
 mans
 spirit
 was
 consigned
 is
 the
 final
 habitation
 of
 the
 condemned
 To
 that
 preliminary
 or
 intermediate
 state
 however
 mens
 works
 do
 follow
 them
 and
 the
 dead
 shall
 surely
 find
 that
 their
 abode
 is
 that
 for
 which
 they
 have
 qualified
 themselves
 while
 in
 the
 flesh
 The
 rich
 mans
 fate
 was
 not
 the
 effect
 of
 riches
 nor
 was
 the
 rest
 into
 which
 Lazarus
 entered
 the
 resultant
 of
 poverty
 Failure
 to
 use
 his
 wealth
 aright
 and
 selfish
 satisfaction
 with
 the
 sensuous
 enjoyment
 of
 earthly
 things
 to
 the
 exclusion
 of
 all
 concern
 for
 the
 needs
 or
 privations
 of
 his
 fellows
 brought
 the
 one
 under
 condemnation
 while
 patience
 in
 suffering
 faith
 in
 God
 and
 such
 righteous
 life
 as
 is
 implied
 though
 not
 expressed
 insured
 happiness
 to
 the
 other
 The
 proud
 selfsufficiency
 of
 the
 rich
 man
 who
 lacked
 nothing
 that
 wealth
 could
 furnish
 and
 who
 kept
 aloof
 from
 the
 needy
 and
 suffering
 was
 his
 besetting
 sin
 The
 aloofness
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 on
 which
 indeed
 they
 prided
 themselves
 as
 their
 very
 name
 signifying
 separatists
 expressed
 was
 thus
 condemned
 The
 parable
 teaches
 the
 continuation
 of
 individual
 existence
 after
 death
 and
 the
 relation
 of
 cause
 to
 effect
 between
 the
 life
 one
 leads
 in
 mortality
 and
 the
 state
 awaiting
 him
 beyond
 UNPROFITABLE
 SERVANTS
 From
 the
 Pharisees
 Jesus
 turned
 to
 His
 disciples
 and
 admonished
 them
 to
 diligence
 Having
 cautioned
 them
 against
 unguarded
 utterances
 or
 actions
 at
 which
 others
 might
 take
 offense
 He
 proceeded
 to
 impress
 the
 absolute
 necessity
 of
 unselfish
 devotion
 toleration
 and
 forgiveness
 The
 apostles
 realizing
 the
 wholesouled
 service
 required
 of
 them
 implored
 the
 Lord
 saying
 Increase
 our
 faith
 They
 were
 shown
 that
 faith
 was
 less
 fitly
 reckoned
 in
 terms
 of
 quantity
 than
 by
 test
 of
 quality
 and
 the
 analogy
 of
 the
 mustard
 seed
 was
 again
 invoked
 And
 the
 Lord
 said
 If
 ye
 had
 faith
 as
 a
 grain
 of
 mustard
 seed
 ye
 might
 say
 unto
 this
 sycamine
 tree
 Be
 thou
 plucked
 up
 by
 the
 root
 and
 be
 thou
 planted
 in
 the
 sea
 and
 it
 should
 obey
 you
 Their
 faith
 could
 best
 be
 gaged
 by
 obedience
 and
 untiring
 service
 This
 was
 emphasized
 by
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Unprofitable
 Servants
 But
 which
 of
 you
 having
 a
 servant
 plowing
 or
 feeding
 cattle
 will
 say
 unto
 him
 by
 and
 by
 when
 he
 is
 come
 from
 the
 field
 Go
 and
 sit
 down
 to
 meat
 And
 will
 not
 rather
 say
 unto
 him
 Make
 ready
 wherewith
 I
 may
 sup
 and
 gird
 thyself
 and
 serve
 me
 till
 I
 have
 eaten
 and
 drunken
 and
 afterward
 thou
 shalt
 eat
 and
 drink
 Doth
 he
 thank
 that
 servant
 because
 he
 did
 the
 things
 that
 were
 commanded
 him
 I
 trow
 not
 So
 likewise
 ye
 when
 ye
 shall
 have
 done
 all
 those
 things
 which
 are
 commanded
 you
 say
 We
 are
 unprofitable
 servants
 we
 have
 done
 that
 which
 was
 our
 duty
 to
 do
 The
 servant
 might
 well
 feel
 that
 after
 a
 days
 work
 in
 the
 field
 he
 is
 entitled
 to
 rest
 but
 on
 reaching
 the
 house
 he
 finds
 other
 demands
 made
 upon
 him
 The
 master
 has
 a
 right
 to
 the
 servants
 time
 and
 attention
 such
 was
 among
 the
 conditions
 under
 which
 the
 servant
 had
 been
 engaged
 and
 while
 his
 employer
 might
 thank
 him
 or
 give
 some
 substantial
 reward
 the
 servant
 cannot
 demand
 such
 recompense
 So
 the
 apostles
 who
 had
 given
 themselves
 entirely
 up
 to
 their
 Masters
 service
 were
 not
 to
 hesitate
 nor
 demur
 whatever
 the
 effort
 or
 sacrifice
 required
 The
 best
 they
 could
 do
 would
 be
 no
 more
 than
 their
 duty
 required
 and
 without
 regard
 to
 the
 Masters
 estimate
 of
 their
 worth
 they
 were
 to
 account
 themselves
 as
 unprofitable
 servants
 TEN
 LEPERS
 HEALED
 In
 the
 course
 of
 His
 journey
 toward
 Jerusalem
 Jesus
 passed
 through
 the
 midst
 of
 Samaria
 and
 Galilee
 Ten
 men
 afflicted
 with
 leprosy
 approached
 probably
 they
 came
 as
 near
 as
 the
 law
 permitted
 yet
 they
 were
 afar
 off
 These
 men
 were
 of
 mixed
 nationality
 the
 plague
 under
 which
 they
 suffered
 in
 common
 had
 made
 them
 companions
 in
 distress
 They
 cried
 aloud
 Jesus
 Master
 have
 mercy
 on
 us
 The
 Lord
 answered
 Go
 shew
 yourselves
 unto
 the
 priests
 This
 instruction
 implied
 their
 ultimate
 healing
 obedience
 would
 be
 the
 test
 of
 their
 faith
 None
 who
 had
 been
 leprous
 could
 be
 lawfully
 restored
 to
 community
 life
 until
 pronounced
 clean
 by
 a
 priest
 The
 stricken
 ten
 hastened
 to
 obey
 the
 Lords
 command
 and
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 that
 as
 they
 went
 they
 were
 cleansed
 One
 of
 the
 ten
 turned
 back
 and
 with
 loud
 voice
 glorified
 God
 then
 he
 prostrated
 himself
 at
 the
 feet
 of
 Christ
 giving
 thanks
 We
 are
 told
 that
 the
 grateful
 one
 was
 a
 Samaritan
 from
 which
 we
 infer
 that
 some
 or
 all
 of
 the
 others
 were
 Jews
 Pained
 over
 the
 lack
 of
 gratitude
 on
 the
 part
 of
 the
 nine
 Jesus
 exclaimed
 Were
 there
 not
 ten
 cleansed
 but
 where
 are
 the
 nine
 There
 are
 not
 found
 that
 return
 to
 give
 glory
 to
 God
 save
 this
 stranger
 And
 to
 the
 cleansed
 Samaritan
 still
 worshiping
 at
 His
 feet
 the
 Lord
 said
 Arise
 go
 thy
 way
 thy
 faith
 hath
 made
 thee
 whole
 Doubtless
 the
 nine
 who
 came
 not
 back
 were
 obedient
 to
 the
 strict
 letter
 of
 the
 Lords
 command
 for
 He
 had
 told
 them
 to
 go
 to
 the
 priests
 but
 their
 lack
 of
 gratitude
 and
 their
 failure
 to
 acknowledge
 the
 power
 of
 God
 in
 their
 restoration
 stand
 in
 unfavorable
 contrast
 with
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 one
 and
 he
 was
 a
 Samaritan
 The
 occurrence
 must
 have
 impressed
 the
 apostles
 as
 another
 evidence
 of
 acceptability
 and
 possible
 excellence
 on
 the
 part
 of
 aliens
 to
 the
 disparagement
 of
 Jewish
 claims
 of
 superiority
 irrespective
 of
 merit
 THE
 PHARISEE
 AND
 THE
 PUBLICAN
 And
 he
 spake
 this
 parable
 unto
 certain
 which
 trusted
 in
 themselves
 that
 they
 were
 righteous
 and
 despised
 others
 Two
 men
 went
 up
 into
 the
 temple
 to
 pray
 the
 one
 a
 Pharisee
 and
 the
 other
 a
 publican
 The
 Pharisee
 stood
 and
 prayed
 thus
 with
 himself
 God
 I
 thank
 thee
 that
 I
 am
 not
 as
 other
 men
 are
 extortioners
 unjust
 adulterers
 or
 even
 as
 this
 publican
 I
 fast
 twice
 in
 the
 week
 I
 give
 tithes
 of
 all
 that
 I
 possess
 And
 the
 publican
 standing
 afar
 off
 would
 not
 lift
 up
 so
 much
 as
 his
 eyes
 unto
 heaven
 but
 smote
 upon
 his
 breast
 saying
 God
 be
 merciful
 to
 me
 a
 sinner
 I
 tell
 you
 this
 man
 went
 down
 to
 his
 house
 justified
 rather
 than
 the
 other
 for
 every
 one
 that
 exalteth
 himself
 shall
 be
 abased
 and
 he
 that
 humbleth
 himself
 shall
 be
 exalted
 We
 are
 expressly
 told
 that
 this
 parable
 was
 given
 for
 the
 benefit
 of
 certain
 ones
 who
 trusted
 in
 their
 selfrighteousness
 as
 an
 assurance
 of
 justification
 before
 God
 It
 was
 not
 addressed
 to
 the
 Pharisees
 nor
 to
 the
 publicans
 specifically
 The
 two
 characters
 are
 types
 of
 widely
 separated
 classes
 There
 may
 have
 been
 much
 of
 the
 Pharisaic
 spirit
 of
 selfcomplacency
 among
 the
 disciples
 and
 some
 of
 it
 even
 among
 the
 Twelve
 A
 Pharisee
 and
 a
 publican
 went
 up
 to
 the
 temple
 to
 pray
 The
 Pharisee
 prayed
 with
 himself
 his
 words
 can
 hardly
 be
 construed
 as
 a
 prayer
 to
 God
 That
 he
 stood
 while
 praying
 was
 not
 an
 impropriety
 for
 the
 standing
 attitude
 was
 usual
 in
 prayer
 the
 publican
 also
 stood
 The
 Pharisee
 thanked
 God
 that
 he
 was
 so
 much
 better
 than
 other
 men
 he
 was
 true
 to
 his
 class
 a
 separatist
 who
 looked
 with
 disdain
 upon
 all
 who
 were
 not
 like
 him
 That
 he
 was
 not
 like
 this
 publican
 was
 made
 a
 point
 of
 special
 thanksgiving
 His
 boast
 that
 he
 fasted
 twice
 a
 week
 and
 gave
 tithes
 of
 all
 that
 he
 possessed
 was
 a
 specification
 of
 worthiness
 above
 what
 was
 required
 by
 the
 law
 as
 then
 administered
 he
 thus
 implied
 that
 God
 was
 his
 debtor
 The
 publican
 standing
 afar
 off
 was
 so
 oppressed
 by
 his
 consciousness
 of
 sin
 and
 his
 absolute
 need
 of
 divine
 help
 that
 he
 cast
 down
 his
 eyes
 and
 smote
 upon
 his
 breast
 craving
 mercy
 as
 a
 penitent
 sinner
 The
 Pharisee
 departed
 justified
 in
 his
 own
 conscience
 and
 before
 man
 prouder
 than
 ever
 the
 other
 went
 down
 to
 his
 house
 justified
 before
 God
 though
 still
 a
 despized
 publican
 The
 parable
 is
 applicable
 to
 all
 men
 its
 moral
 was
 summed
 up
 in
 a
 repetition
 of
 our
 Lords
 words
 spoken
 in
 the
 house
 of
 the
 chief
 Pharisee
 For
 every
 one
 that
 exalteth
 himself
 shall
 be
 abased
 and
 he
 that
 humbleth
 himself
 shall
 be
 exalted
 ON
 MARRIAGE
 AND
 DIVORCE
 While
 wending
 His
 way
 by
 short
 stages
 toward
 Jerusalem
 and
 while
 still
 beyond
 or
 on
 the
 farther
 side
 of
 Jordan
 and
 therefore
 in
 Perean
 territory
 Jesus
 was
 met
 by
 a
 body
 of
 Pharisees
 who
 had
 come
 with
 the
 deliberate
 purpose
 of
 inciting
 Him
 to
 say
 or
 do
 something
 on
 which
 they
 could
 base
 an
 accusation
 The
 question
 they
 had
 agreed
 to
 submit
 related
 to
 marriage
 and
 divorce
 and
 no
 subject
 had
 been
 more
 vehemently
 contested
 in
 their
 own
 schools
 and
 among
 their
 own
 rabbis
 The
 crafty
 questioners
 may
 have
 hoped
 that
 Jesus
 would
 denounce
 the
 adulterous
 state
 in
 which
 Herod
 Antipas
 was
 then
 living
 and
 so
 bring
 upon
 Himself
 the
 fury
 of
 Herodias
 to
 which
 the
 Baptist
 had
 already
 died
 a
 victim
 Is
 it
 lawful
 for
 a
 man
 to
 put
 away
 his
 wife
 for
 every
 cause
 they
 asked
 Jesus
 cited
 the
 original
 and
 eternal
 law
 of
 God
 in
 the
 matter
 and
 indicated
 the
 only
 rational
 conclusion
 to
 be
 drawn
 therefrom
 Have
 ye
 not
 read
 that
 he
 which
 made
 them
 at
 the
 beginning
 made
 them
 male
 and
 female
 and
 said
 For
 this
 cause
 shall
 a
 man
 leave
 father
 and
 mother
 and
 shall
 cleave
 to
 his
 wife
 and
 they
 twain
 shall
 be
 one
 flesh
 Wherefore
 they
 are
 no
 more
 twain
 but
 one
 flesh
 What
 therefore
 God
 hath
 joined
 together
 let
 not
 man
 put
 asunder
 God
 had
 provided
 for
 honorable
 marriage
 and
 had
 made
 the
 relation
 between
 husband
 and
 wife
 paramount
 even
 to
 that
 of
 children
 to
 parents
 the
 severing
 of
 such
 a
 union
 was
 an
 invention
 of
 man
 not
 a
 command
 of
 God
 The
 Pharisees
 had
 a
 ready
 rejoinder
 Why
 did
 Moses
 then
 command
 to
 give
 a
 writing
 of
 divorcement
 and
 to
 put
 her
 away
 Be
 it
 remembered
 that
 Moses
 had
 not
 commanded
 divorce
 but
 had
 required
 that
 in
 case
 a
 man
 should
 separate
 from
 his
 wife
 he
 give
 her
 a
 bill
 of
 divorcement
 Jesus
 made
 this
 fact
 plain
 saying
 Moses
 because
 of
 the
 hardness
 of
 your
 hearts
 suffered
 you
 to
 put
 away
 your
 wives
 but
 from
 the
 beginning
 it
 was
 not
 so
 The
 higher
 requirement
 of
 the
 gospel
 followed
 And
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Whosoever
 shall
 put
 away
 his
 wife
 except
 it
 be
 for
 fornication
 and
 shall
 marry
 another
 committeth
 adultery
 and
 whoso
 marrieth
 her
 which
 is
 put
 away
 doth
 commit
 adultery
 The
 Mosaic
 provision
 had
 been
 but
 permissive
 and
 was
 justified
 only
 because
 of
 existing
 unrighteousness
 Strict
 compliance
 with
 the
 doctrine
 enunciated
 by
 Jesus
 Christ
 is
 the
 only
 means
 by
 which
 a
 perfect
 social
 order
 can
 be
 maintained
 It
 is
 important
 to
 note
 however
 that
 in
 His
 reply
 to
 the
 casuistical
 Pharisees
 Jesus
 announced
 no
 specific
 or
 binding
 rule
 as
 to
 legal
 divorces
 the
 putting
 away
 of
 a
 wife
 as
 contemplated
 under
 the
 Mosaic
 custom
 involved
 no
 judicial
 investigation
 or
 action
 by
 an
 established
 court
 In
 our
 Lords
 day
 the
 prevailing
 laxity
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 marital
 obligation
 had
 produced
 a
 state
 of
 appalling
 corruption
 in
 Israel
 and
 woman
 who
 by
 the
 law
 of
 God
 had
 been
 made
 a
 companion
 and
 partner
 with
 man
 had
 become
 his
 slave
 The
 worlds
 greatest
 champion
 of
 woman
 and
 womanhood
 is
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 The
 Pharisees
 retired
 foiled
 in
 purpose
 and
 convicted
 in
 conscience
 The
 Lords
 strict
 construction
 of
 the
 marriage
 bond
 was
 startling
 even
 to
 some
 of
 the
 disciples
 these
 came
 to
 Him
 privately
 saying
 that
 if
 a
 man
 was
 so
 bound
 it
 would
 be
 better
 not
 to
 marry
 at
 all
 Such
 a
 broad
 generalization
 the
 Lord
 disapproved
 except
 so
 far
 as
 it
 might
 apply
 in
 special
 cases
 True
 there
 were
 some
 who
 were
 physically
 incapacitated
 for
 marriage
 others
 voluntarily
 devoted
 themselves
 to
 a
 celibate
 life
 and
 some
 few
 adopted
 celibacy
 for
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heavens
 sake
 that
 thereby
 they
 might
 be
 free
 to
 render
 all
 their
 time
 and
 energy
 to
 the
 Lords
 service
 But
 the
 disciples
 conclusion
 that
 it
 is
 not
 good
 to
 marry
 was
 true
 only
 in
 the
 exceptional
 instances
 stated
 Marriage
 is
 honorable
 for
 neither
 man
 without
 woman
 nor
 woman
 without
 man
 can
 be
 perfect
 in
 the
 Lords
 sight
 JESUS
 AND
 THE
 LITTLE
 ONES
 The
 next
 event
 of
 record
 is
 one
 of
 surpassing
 sweetness
 rich
 in
 precept
 and
 invaluable
 in
 example
 Mothers
 brought
 their
 little
 children
 to
 Jesus
 reverently
 desiring
 that
 the
 lives
 of
 those
 little
 ones
 be
 brightened
 by
 a
 sight
 of
 the
 Master
 and
 be
 blessed
 by
 a
 touch
 of
 His
 hand
 or
 a
 word
 from
 His
 lips
 The
 circumstance
 appears
 in
 appropriate
 sequence
 to
 that
 of
 the
 Lords
 instructions
 concerning
 the
 sacredness
 of
 marriage
 and
 the
 sanctity
 of
 the
 home
 The
 disciples
 zealous
 that
 their
 Master
 be
 not
 troubled
 unnecessarily
 and
 conscious
 of
 the
 continuous
 demands
 on
 His
 time
 and
 attention
 rebuked
 those
 who
 had
 so
 ventured
 to
 trespass
 Even
 the
 disciples
 seem
 to
 have
 been
 yet
 under
 the
 influence
 of
 the
 traditional
 conception
 that
 women
 and
 children
 were
 of
 inferior
 status
 and
 that
 for
 such
 to
 seek
 the
 Lords
 attention
 was
 an
 act
 of
 presumption
 Jesus
 was
 displeased
 over
 the
 misdirected
 zeal
 of
 His
 followers
 and
 rebuked
 them
 Then
 He
 uttered
 that
 memorable
 sentence
 of
 infinite
 tenderness
 and
 divine
 affection
 Suffer
 the
 little
 children
 to
 come
 unto
 me
 and
 forbid
 them
 not
 for
 of
 such
 is
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 Taking
 the
 children
 one
 by
 one
 into
 His
 arms
 He
 laid
 His
 hands
 upon
 them
 and
 blessed
 them
 Then
 said
 He
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Whosoever
 shall
 not
 receive
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 as
 a
 little
 child
 he
 shall
 not
 enter
 therein
 ONE
 THING
 THOU
 LACKEST
 Jesus
 was
 accosted
 on
 the
 way
 by
 a
 young
 man
 who
 came
 running
 to
 meet
 or
 overtake
 Him
 and
 who
 knelt
 at
 His
 feet
 inquiring
 Good
 Master
 what
 shall
 I
 do
 that
 I
 may
 inherit
 eternal
 life
 The
 question
 was
 asked
 in
 earnestness
 the
 questioner
 was
 in
 very
 different
 spirit
 from
 that
 of
 the
 lawyer
 who
 made
 a
 similar
 inquiry
 with
 the
 purpose
 of
 tempting
 the
 Master
 Jesus
 said
 Why
 callest
 thou
 me
 good
 there
 is
 none
 good
 but
 one
 that
 is
 God
 This
 remark
 was
 no
 denial
 of
 sinlessness
 on
 the
 Saviors
 part
 the
 young
 man
 had
 called
 Him
 good
 by
 way
 of
 polite
 compliment
 rather
 than
 in
 recognition
 of
 His
 Godship
 and
 Jesus
 declined
 to
 acknowledge
 the
 distinction
 when
 applied
 in
 that
 sense
 The
 Lords
 remark
 must
 have
 deepened
 the
 young
 mans
 conception
 as
 to
 the
 seriousness
 of
 his
 question
 Then
 said
 Jesus
 If
 thou
 wilt
 enter
 into
 life
 keep
 the
 commandments
 To
 the
 further
 inquiry
 as
 to
 which
 commandments
 were
 meant
 Jesus
 cited
 the
 prohibitions
 against
 murder
 adultery
 theft
 and
 the
 bearing
 of
 false
 witness
 and
 the
 requirements
 as
 to
 honoring
 parents
 and
 loving
 ones
 neighbor
 as
 ones
 self
 In
 simplicity
 and
 without
 pride
 or
 sense
 of
 selfrighteousness
 the
 young
 man
 said
 All
 these
 things
 have
 I
 kept
 from
 my
 youth
 up
 what
 lack
 I
 yet
 His
 evident
 sincerity
 appealed
 to
 Jesus
 who
 looked
 upon
 him
 lovingly
 and
 said
 One
 thing
 thou
 lackest
 go
 thy
 way
 sell
 whatsoever
 thou
 hast
 and
 give
 to
 the
 poor
 and
 thou
 shalt
 have
 treasure
 in
 heaven
 and
 come
 take
 up
 the
 cross
 and
 follow
 me
 The
 young
 man
 was
 disappointed
 and
 saddened
 He
 had
 probably
 expected
 to
 hear
 the
 great
 Teacher
 prescribe
 some
 one
 special
 observance
 by
 which
 excellence
 could
 be
 achieved
 Luke
 tells
 us
 that
 the
 young
 man
 was
 a
 ruler
 this
 may
 mean
 that
 he
 was
 a
 presiding
 official
 in
 the
 local
 synagog
 or
 possibly
 a
 Sanhedrist
 He
 was
 well
 versed
 in
 the
 law
 and
 had
 been
 strict
 in
 obedience
 thereto
 He
 desired
 to
 advance
 in
 good
 works
 and
 make
 clear
 his
 title
 to
 an
 eternal
 heritage
 But
 the
 Master
 prescribed
 what
 he
 had
 least
 expected
 And
 he
 was
 sad
 at
 that
 saying
 and
 went
 away
 grieved
 for
 he
 had
 great
 possessions
 In
 his
 way
 he
 yearned
 for
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 yet
 more
 devotedly
 he
 loved
 his
 great
 possessions
 To
 give
 up
 wealth
 social
 position
 and
 official
 distinction
 was
 too
 great
 a
 sacrifice
 and
 the
 necessary
 selfdenial
 was
 a
 cross
 too
 heavy
 for
 him
 to
 bear
 even
 though
 treasure
 in
 heaven
 and
 life
 eternal
 were
 offered
 him
 Love
 of
 worldly
 things
 was
 this
 mans
 besetting
 weakness
 Jesus
 diagnosed
 his
 case
 and
 prescribed
 a
 suitable
 remedy
 We
 are
 not
 warranted
 in
 saying
 that
 the
 same
 treatment
 would
 be
 best
 in
 all
 cases
 of
 spiritual
 defection
 but
 where
 the
 symptoms
 indicate
 the
 need
 it
 may
 be
 employed
 with
 confidence
 as
 to
 the
 cure
 Gazing
 sorrowfully
 upon
 the
 retreating
 figure
 of
 the
 wealthy
 young
 ruler
 Jesus
 said
 to
 the
 disciples
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 a
 rich
 man
 shall
 hardly
 enter
 into
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 To
 impress
 the
 lesson
 more
 thoroughly
 He
 applied
 one
 of
 the
 figurative
 proverbs
 of
 the
 age
 and
 said
 It
 is
 easier
 for
 a
 camel
 to
 go
 through
 the
 eye
 of
 a
 needle
 than
 for
 a
 rich
 man
 to
 enter
 into
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 At
 this
 statement
 the
 disciples
 were
 amazed
 Who
 then
 can
 be
 saved
 they
 wondered
 Jesus
 understood
 their
 perplexity
 and
 encouraged
 them
 with
 the
 assurance
 that
 with
 God
 all
 things
 are
 possible
 Thus
 were
 they
 given
 to
 understand
 that
 while
 wealth
 is
 a
 means
 of
 temptation
 to
 which
 many
 succumb
 it
 is
 no
 insuperable
 obstacle
 no
 insurmountable
 barrier
 in
 the
 way
 of
 entrance
 to
 the
 kingdom
 Had
 the
 young
 ruler
 followed
 the
 advice
 called
 forth
 by
 his
 inquiry
 his
 possession
 of
 riches
 would
 have
 made
 possible
 to
 him
 meritorious
 service
 such
 as
 few
 are
 able
 to
 render
 Willingness
 to
 place
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 above
 all
 material
 possessions
 was
 the
 one
 thing
 he
 lacked
 Everyone
 of
 us
 may
 pertinently
 ask
 What
 do
 I
 lack
 THE
 FIRST
 MAY
 BE
 LAST
 AND
 THE
 LAST
 FIRST
 The
 sorrowful
 departure
 of
 the
 rich
 young
 ruler
 whose
 great
 possessions
 were
 so
 much
 a
 part
 of
 his
 life
 that
 he
 could
 not
 give
 them
 up
 at
 the
 time
 though
 we
 may
 hope
 that
 he
 afterward
 did
 brought
 forth
 from
 Peter
 an
 abrupt
 question
 which
 revealed
 the
 course
 of
 his
 thoughts
 and
 aspirations
 Behold
 we
 have
 forsaken
 all
 and
 followed
 thee
 what
 shall
 we
 have
 therefore
 Whether
 he
 spoke
 for
 himself
 alone
 or
 by
 his
 use
 of
 the
 plural
 we
 meant
 to
 include
 all
 the
 Twelve
 is
 uncertain
 and
 unimportant
 He
 was
 thinking
 of
 the
 home
 and
 family
 he
 had
 left
 and
 a
 longing
 for
 them
 was
 pardonable
 he
 was
 thinking
 also
 of
 boats
 and
 nets
 hooks
 and
 lines
 and
 the
 lucrative
 business
 for
 which
 such
 things
 stood
 All
 these
 he
 had
 forsaken
 what
 was
 to
 be
 his
 reward
 Jesus
 answered
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 ye
 which
 have
 followed
 me
 in
 the
 regeneration
 when
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 shall
 sit
 in
 the
 throne
 of
 his
 glory
 ye
 also
 shall
 sit
 upon
 twelve
 thrones
 judging
 the
 twelve
 tribes
 of
 Israel
 It
 is
 doubtful
 that
 Peter
 or
 any
 other
 of
 the
 Twelve
 had
 ever
 conceived
 of
 so
 great
 a
 distinction
 The
 day
 of
 regeneration
 when
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 shall
 sit
 on
 the
 throne
 of
 His
 glory
 as
 Judge
 and
 King
 is
 even
 yet
 future
 but
 in
 that
 day
 those
 of
 the
 Lords
 Twelve
 who
 endured
 to
 the
 end
 shall
 be
 enthroned
 as
 judges
 in
 Israel
 The
 further
 assurance
 was
 given
 that
 every
 one
 that
 hath
 forsaken
 houses
 or
 brethren
 or
 sisters
 or
 father
 or
 mother
 or
 wife
 or
 children
 or
 lands
 for
 my
 names
 sake
 shall
 receive
 an
 hundredfold
 and
 shall
 inherit
 everlasting
 life
 Rewards
 of
 such
 transcendent
 worth
 could
 scarcely
 be
 reckoned
 or
 their
 meaning
 comprehended
 Lest
 those
 to
 whom
 they
 were
 promised
 might
 count
 too
 surely
 upon
 successful
 attainment
 to
 the
 neglect
 of
 effort
 and
 become
 proud
 withal
 the
 Lord
 added
 this
 profound
 precept
 of
 caution
 But
 many
 that
 are
 first
 shall
 be
 last
 and
 the
 last
 shall
 be
 first
 It
 was
 the
 text
 of
 the
 sermon
 known
 to
 us
 as
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Laborers
 Hear
 it
 For
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 like
 unto
 a
 man
 that
 is
 an
 householder
 which
 went
 out
 early
 in
 the
 morning
 to
 hire
 labourers
 into
 his
 vineyard
 And
 when
 he
 had
 agreed
 with
 the
 labourers
 for
 a
 penny
 a
 day
 he
 sent
 them
 into
 his
 vineyard
 And
 he
 went
 out
 about
 the
 third
 hour
 and
 saw
 others
 standing
 idle
 in
 the
 marketplace
 and
 said
 unto
 them
 Go
 ye
 also
 into
 the
 vineyard
 and
 whatsoever
 is
 right
 I
 will
 give
 you
 And
 they
 went
 their
 way
 Again
 he
 went
 out
 about
 the
 sixth
 and
 ninth
 hour
 and
 did
 likewise
 And
 about
 the
 eleventh
 hour
 he
 went
 out
 and
 found
 others
 standing
 idle
 and
 saith
 unto
 them
 Why
 stand
 ye
 here
 all
 the
 day
 idle
 They
 say
 unto
 him
 Because
 no
 man
 hath
 hired
 us
 He
 saith
 unto
 them
 Go
 ye
 also
 into
 the
 vineyard
 and
 whatsoever
 is
 right
 that
 shall
 ye
 receive
 So
 when
 even
 was
 come
 the
 lord
 of
 the
 vineyard
 saith
 unto
 his
 steward
 Call
 the
 labourers
 and
 give
 them
 their
 hire
 beginning
 from
 the
 last
 unto
 the
 first
 And
 when
 they
 came
 that
 were
 hired
 about
 the
 eleventh
 hour
 they
 received
 every
 man
 a
 penny
 But
 when
 the
 first
 came
 they
 supposed
 that
 they
 should
 have
 received
 more
 and
 they
 likewise
 received
 every
 man
 a
 penny
 And
 when
 they
 had
 received
 it
 they
 murmured
 against
 the
 goodman
 of
 the
 house
 saying
 These
 last
 have
 wrought
 but
 one
 hour
 and
 thou
 hast
 made
 them
 equal
 unto
 us
 which
 have
 borne
 the
 burden
 and
 heat
 of
 the
 day
 But
 he
 answered
 one
 of
 them
 and
 said
 Friend
 I
 do
 thee
 no
 wrong
 didst
 not
 thou
 agree
 with
 me
 for
 a
 penny
 Take
 that
 thine
 is
 and
 go
 thy
 way
 I
 will
 give
 unto
 this
 last
 even
 as
 unto
 thee
 Is
 it
 not
 lawful
 for
 me
 to
 do
 what
 I
 will
 with
 mine
 own
 Is
 thine
 eye
 evil
 because
 I
 am
 good
 So
 the
 last
 shall
 be
 first
 and
 the
 first
 last
 for
 many
 be
 called
 but
 few
 chosen
 The
 procedure
 of
 a
 householder
 going
 into
 the
 marketplace
 to
 hire
 laborers
 was
 common
 to
 the
 time
 and
 place
 and
 is
 still
 an
 ordinary
 occurrence
 in
 many
 lands
 The
 first
 to
 be
 hired
 in
 the
 course
 of
 the
 story
 made
 a
 definite
 bargain
 as
 to
 wages
 Those
 who
 were
 employed
 at
 nine
 twelve
 and
 three
 oclock
 respectively
 went
 willingly
 without
 agreement
 as
 to
 what
 they
 were
 to
 receive
 so
 glad
 were
 they
 to
 find
 a
 chance
 to
 work
 that
 they
 lost
 no
 time
 in
 specifying
 terms
 At
 five
 oclock
 in
 the
 afternoon
 or
 evening
 when
 but
 a
 single
 hour
 of
 the
 working
 day
 remained
 the
 last
 band
 of
 laborers
 went
 to
 work
 trusting
 to
 the
 masters
 word
 that
 whatever
 was
 right
 they
 should
 receive
 That
 they
 had
 not
 found
 work
 earlier
 in
 the
 day
 was
 no
 fault
 of
 theirs
 they
 had
 been
 ready
 and
 willing
 and
 had
 waited
 at
 the
 place
 where
 employment
 was
 most
 likely
 to
 be
 secured
 At
 the
 close
 of
 the
 day
 the
 laborers
 came
 for
 their
 wages
 this
 was
 in
 accordance
 with
 law
 and
 custom
 for
 it
 had
 been
 established
 by
 statute
 in
 Israel
 that
 the
 employer
 should
 pay
 the
 servant
 hired
 by
 the
 day
 before
 the
 sun
 went
 down
 Under
 instructions
 the
 steward
 who
 acted
 as
 paymaster
 began
 with
 those
 who
 had
 been
 engaged
 at
 the
 eleventh
 hour
 and
 to
 each
 of
 them
 he
 gave
 a
 denarius
 or
 Roman
 penny
 worth
 about
 fifteen
 cents
 in
 our
 money
 and
 the
 usual
 wage
 for
 a
 days
 work
 This
 was
 the
 amount
 for
 which
 those
 who
 began
 earliest
 had
 severally
 bargained
 and
 as
 these
 saw
 their
 fellowworkers
 who
 had
 served
 but
 an
 hour
 receive
 each
 a
 penny
 they
 probably
 exulted
 in
 the
 expectation
 of
 receiving
 a
 wage
 proportionately
 larger
 notwithstanding
 their
 stipulation
 But
 each
 of
 them
 received
 a
 penny
 and
 no
 more
 Then
 they
 complained
 not
 because
 they
 had
 been
 underpaid
 but
 because
 the
 others
 had
 received
 a
 full
 days
 pay
 for
 but
 part
 of
 a
 days
 work
 The
 master
 answered
 in
 all
 kindness
 reminding
 them
 of
 their
 agreement
 Could
 he
 not
 be
 just
 to
 them
 and
 charitable
 to
 the
 rest
 if
 he
 so
 chose
 His
 money
 was
 his
 own
 and
 he
 could
 give
 of
 it
 as
 he
 liked
 Were
 those
 grumblers
 justified
 in
 their
 evil
 displeasure
 because
 their
 master
 was
 charitable
 and
 good
 So
 said
 Jesus
 passing
 directly
 from
 the
 story
 to
 one
 of
 the
 lessons
 it
 was
 designed
 to
 teach
 the
 last
 shall
 be
 first
 and
 the
 first
 last
 for
 many
 be
 called
 but
 few
 chosen
 The
 parable
 was
 plainly
 intended
 for
 the
 edification
 of
 the
 Twelve
 It
 was
 called
 out
 by
 Peters
 question
 What
 shall
 we
 have
 therefore
 It
 stands
 as
 truly
 in
 force
 today
 as
 when
 it
 was
 delivered
 by
 the
 Master
 as
 a
 rebuke
 of
 the
 bargaining
 spirit
 in
 the
 Lords
 work
 God
 needs
 workers
 and
 such
 as
 will
 labor
 faithfully
 and
 effectively
 are
 welcomed
 into
 the
 vineyard
 If
 before
 beginning
 they
 insist
 on
 the
 stipulation
 of
 a
 wage
 and
 this
 be
 agreed
 to
 each
 shall
 receive
 his
 penny
 provided
 he
 has
 not
 lost
 his
 place
 through
 idleness
 or
 transgression
 But
 those
 who
 diligently
 labor
 knowing
 that
 the
 Master
 will
 give
 to
 them
 whatever
 is
 right
 and
 with
 thought
 for
 the
 work
 rather
 than
 for
 the
 wage
 shall
 find
 themselves
 more
 bountifully
 enriched
 A
 man
 may
 work
 for
 wages
 and
 yet
 not
 be
 a
 hireling
 Between
 the
 worthy
 hired
 servant
 and
 the
 hireling
 there
 is
 the
 difference
 that
 distinguishes
 the
 shepherd
 from
 the
 sheep
 herder
 Was
 there
 not
 a
 suggestion
 of
 the
 hirelings
 spirit
 in
 the
 query
 of
 even
 the
 first
 of
 the
 apostles
 What
 shall
 we
 have
 therefore
 The
 Twelve
 had
 been
 called
 into
 service
 early
 in
 the
 Saviors
 ministry
 they
 had
 responded
 to
 the
 call
 without
 promise
 of
 even
 a
 penny
 they
 were
 yet
 to
 feel
 the
 burden
 and
 heat
 of
 the
 day
 but
 they
 were
 solemnly
 cautioned
 against
 attempt
 or
 desire
 to
 fix
 their
 reward
 The
 Master
 shall
 judge
 as
 to
 the
 deserts
 of
 each
 servant
 the
 wage
 at
 best
 is
 a
 free
 gift
 for
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 strict
 accounting
 who
 of
 us
 is
 not
 in
 debt
 to
 God
 The
 last
 called
 is
 as
 likely
 as
 the
 first
 to
 prove
 unworthy
 No
 general
 reversal
 is
 implied
 whereby
 all
 the
 late
 comers
 shall
 be
 advanced
 and
 all
 the
 early
 workers
 demoted
 Many
 that
 are
 first
 shall
 be
 last
 was
 the
 Lords
 statement
 and
 by
 implication
 we
 may
 understand
 that
 not
 all
 the
 last
 though
 some
 of
 them
 may
 be
 counted
 among
 the
 first
 Of
 the
 many
 called
 or
 permitted
 to
 labor
 in
 the
 vineyard
 of
 the
 Lord
 few
 may
 so
 excel
 as
 to
 be
 chosen
 for
 exaltation
 above
 their
 fellows
 Even
 the
 call
 and
 ordination
 to
 the
 Holy
 Apostleship
 is
 no
 guarantee
 of
 eventual
 exaltation
 in
 the
 celestial
 kingdom
 Iscariot
 was
 so
 called
 and
 placed
 among
 the
 first
 now
 verily
 he
 is
 far
 below
 the
 last
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God

 Rich
 Men
 and
 Their
 StewardsA
 certain
 rich
 man
 had
 a
 steward
 We
 learn
 here
 incidentally
 how
 evenly
 balanced
 are
 the
 various
 conditions
 of
 life
 in
 a
 community
 and
 how
 little
 of
 substantial
 advantage
 wealth
 can
 confer
 on
 its
 possessor
 As
 your
 property
 increases
 your
 personal
 control
 over
 it
 diminishes
 the
 more
 you
 possess
 the
 more
 you
 must
 entrust
 to
 others
 Those
 who
 do
 their

 Parables
 of
 our
 Lord
 p
 
 
 The
 Mammon
 of
 UnrighteousnessThe
 revised
 version
 of
 Luke
 
 reads
 And
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Make
 to
 yourself
 friends
 by
 means
 of
 the
 mammon
 of
 unrighteousness
 that
 when
 it
 shall
 fail
 they
 may
 receive
 you
 into
 the
 eternal
 tabernacles
 The
 Lords
 counsel
 to
 the
 disciples
 was
 to
 so
 use
 worldly
 wealth
 as
 to
 accomplish
 good
 thereby
 that
 when
 it
 ie
 all
 earthly
 possessions
 fail
 they
 would
 have
 friends
 to
 welcome
 them
 into
 the
 eternal
 tabernacles
 or
 heavenly
 mansions
 In
 studying
 a
 parable
 based
 on
 contrasts
 such
 as
 this
 one
 is
 care
 must
 be
 exercized
 not
 to
 carry
 too
 far
 any
 one
 point
 of
 analogy
 Thus
 we
 cannot
 reasonably
 gather
 that
 Jesus
 intended
 even
 to
 intimate
 that
 the
 prerogative
 of
 receiving
 any
 soul
 into
 the
 eternal
 tabernacles
 or
 excluding
 therefrom
 rests
 with
 those
 who
 on
 earth
 had
 been
 benefited
 or
 injured
 through
 that
 persons
 acts
 except
 so
 far
 as
 their
 witness
 to
 his
 deeds
 may
 be
 taken
 into
 account
 in
 the
 final
 judgment
 The
 whole
 parable
 is
 full
 of
 wisdom
 for
 him
 who
 is
 in
 search
 of
 such
 to
 the
 hypercritical
 mind
 it
 may
 appear
 inconsistent
 as
 so
 it
 did
 appear
 to
 the
 Pharisees
 who
 derided
 Jesus
 for
 the
 story
 He
 had
 told
 Luke
 
 is
 rendered
 in
 the
 revised
 version
 And
 the
 Pharisees
 who
 were
 lovers
 of
 money
 heard
 all
 these
 things
 and
 they
 scoffed
 at
 him
 
 Lazarus
 and
 DivesOf
 all
 our
 Lords
 recorded
 parables
 this
 is
 the
 only
 one
 in
 which
 a
 personal
 name
 is
 applied
 to
 any
 of
 the
 characters
 The
 name
 Lazarus
 used
 in
 the
 parable
 was
 also
 the
 true
 name
 of
 a
 man
 whom
 Jesus
 loved
 and
 who
 subsequent
 to
 the
 delivery
 of
 this
 parable
 was
 restored
 to
 life
 after
 he
 had
 lain
 for
 days
 in
 the
 tomb
 The
 name
 a
 Greek
 variant
 of
 Eleazar
 signifies
 God
 is
 my
 help
 In
 many
 theological
 writings
 the
 rich
 man
 of
 this
 parable
 is
 called
 Dives
 but
 the
 name
 is
 not
 of
 scriptural
 usage
 Dives
 is
 a
 Latin
 adjective
 meaning
 rich
 Lazarus
 the
 brother
 of
 Martha
 and
 Mary
 John
 
 
 
 is
 one
 of
 three
 men
 mentioned
 by
 name
 as
 subjects
 of
 our

 miracles
 the

 Divergent
 Views
 Concerning
 DivorceIn
 relation
 to
 the
 different
 opinions
 upon
 this
 subject
 among
 Jewish
 authorities
 in
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 Geikie
 vol
 ii
 p
 
 says
 Among
 the
 questions
 of
 the
 day
 fiercely
 debated
 between
 the
 great
 rival
 schools
 of
 Hillel
 and
 Shammai
 no
 one
 was
 more
 so
 than
 that
 of
 divorce
 The
 school
 of
 Hillel
 contended
 that
 a
 man
 had
 a
 right
 to
 divorce
 his
 wife
 for
 any
 cause
 he
 might
 assign
 if
 it
 were
 no
 more
 than
 his
 having
 ceased
 to
 love
 her
 or
 his
 having
 seen
 one
 he
 liked
 better
 or
 her
 having
 cooked
 a
 dinner
 badly
 The
 school
 of
 Shammai
 on
 the
 contrary
 held
 that
 divorce
 could
 be
 issued
 only
 for
 the
 crime
 of
 adultery
 and
 offences
 against
 chastity
 If
 it
 were
 possible
 to
 get
 Jesus
 to
 pronounce
 in
 favor
 of
 either
 school
 the
 hostility
 of
 the
 other
 would
 be
 roused
 and
 hence
 it
 seemed
 a
 favorable
 chance
 for
 compromising
 Him
 The
 following
 from
 Dummelows
 Commentary
 dealing
 with
 Matt
 
 is
 further
 illustrative
 Rabbi
 Akiba
 Hillelite
 said
 If
 a
 man
 sees
 a
 woman
 handsomer
 than
 his
 own
 wife
 he
 may
 put
 her
 his
 wife
 away
 because
 it
 is
 said
 If
 she
 find
 not
 favor
 in
 his
 eyes
 The
 school
 of
 Hillel
 said
 If
 the
 wife
 cook
 her
 husbands
 food
 ill
 by
 oversalting
 or
 overroasting
 it
 she
 is
 to
 be
 put
 away
 On
 the
 other
 hand
 Rabbi
 Jochanan
 a
 Shammaite
 said
 The
 putting
 away
 of
 a
 wife
 is
 odious
 Both
 schools
 agreed
 that
 a
 divorced
 wife
 could
 not
 be
 taken
 back
 Rabbi
 Chananiah
 said
 God
 has
 not
 subscribed
 His
 name
 to
 divorces
 except
 among
 Israelites
 as
 if
 He
 had
 said
 I
 have
 conceded
 to
 the
 Israelites
 the
 right
 of
 dismissing
 their
 wives
 but
 to
 the
 Gentiles
 I
 have
 not
 conceded
 it
 Jesus
 retorts
 that
 it
 is
 not
 the
 privilege
 but
 the
 infamy
 and
 reproach
 of
 Israel
 that
 Moses
 found
 it
 necessary
 to
 tolerate
 divorce
 
 Jesus
 the
 Ennobler
 of
 WomanGeikie
 thus
 paraphrases
 part
 of
 Christs
 reply
 to
 the
 Pharisees
 question
 concerning
 divorce
 and
 comments
 thereon
 I
 say
 therefore
 that
 whoever
 puts
 away
 his
 wife
 except
 for
 fornication
 which
 destroys
 the
 very
 essence
 of
 marriage
 by
 dissolving
 the
 oneness
 it
 had
 formed
 and
 shall
 marry
 another
 commits
 adultery
 and
 whoever
 marries
 her
 who
 is
 put
 away
 for
 any
 other
 cause
 commits
 adultery
 because
 the
 woman
 is
 still
 in
 Gods
 sight
 wife
 of
 him
 who
 had
 divorced
 her
 This
 statement
 was
 of
 far
 deeper
 moment
 than
 the
 mere
 silencing
 of
 malignant
 spies
 It
 was
 designed
 to
 set
 forth
 for
 all
 ages
 the
 law
 of
 His
 New
 Kingdom
 in
 the
 supreme
 matter
 of
 family
 life
 It
 swept
 away
 for
 ever
 from
 His
 Society
 the
 conception
 of
 woman
 as
 a
 mere
 toy
 or
 slave
 of
 man
 and
 based
 true
 relations
 of
 the
 sexes
 on
 the
 eternal
 foundation
 of
 truth
 right
 honor
 and
 love
 To
 ennoble
 the
 House
 and
 the
 Family
 by
 raising
 woman
 to
 her
 true
 position
 was
 essential
 to
 the
 future
 stability
 of
 His
 Kingdom
 as
 one
 of
 purity
 and
 spiritual
 worth
 By
 making
 marriage
 indissoluble
 He
 proclaimed
 the
 equal
 rights
 of
 woman
 and
 man
 within
 the
 limits
 of
 the
 family
 and
 in
 this
 gave
 their
 charter
 of

 mothers
 of

 The
 Blessing
 of
 ChildrenWhen
 Christ
 a
 resurrected
 Being
 appeared
 among
 the
 Nephites
 on
 the
 western
 continent
 He
 took
 the
 children
 one
 by
 one
 and
 blessed
 them
 and
 the
 assembled
 multitude
 saw
 the
 little
 ones
 encircled
 as
 with
 fire
 while
 angels
 ministered
 unto
 them
 
 Nephi
 
 Through
 modern
 revelation
 the
 Lord
 has
 directed
 that
 all
 children
 born
 in
 the
 Church
 be
 brought
 for
 blessing
 to
 those
 who
 are
 authorized
 to
 administer
 this
 ordinance
 of
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 The
 commandment
 is
 as
 follows
 Every
 member
 of
 the
 church
 of
 Christ
 having
 children
 is
 to
 bring
 them
 unto
 the
 elders
 before
 the
 church
 who
 are
 to
 lay
 their
 hands
 upon
 them
 in
 the
 name
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 and
 bless
 them
 in
 His
 name
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 Accordingly
 it
 is
 now
 the
 custom
 in
 the
 Church
 to
 bring
 the
 little
 ones
 to
 the
 Fastday
 service
 in
 the
 several
 wards
 at
 which
 they
 are
 received
 one
 by
 one
 into
 the
 arms
 of
 the
 elders
 and
 blessed
 names
 being
 given
 them
 at
 the
 same
 time
 The
 father
 of
 the
 child
 if
 he
 be
 an
 elder
 is
 expected
 to
 participate
 in
 the
 ordinance
 The
 blessing
 of
 children
 is
 in
 no
 sense
 analogous
 to
 far
 less
 is
 it
 a
 substitution
 for
 the
 ordinance
 of
 baptism
 which
 is
 to
 be
 administered
 only
 to
 those
 who
 have
 come
 to
 years
 of
 understanding
 and
 who
 are
 capable
 of
 repentance
 As
 the
 author
 has
 written
 elsewhere
 Some
 point
 to
 the
 incident
 of
 Christ
 blessing
 little
 children
 and
 rebuking
 those
 who
 would
 forbid
 the
 little
 ones
 coming
 unto
 Him
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 Luke
 
 as
 an
 evidence
 in
 favor
 of
 infant
 baptism
 but
 as
 has
 been
 tersely
 saidFrom
 the
 action
 of
 Christs
 blessing
 infants
 to
 infer
 they
 are
 to
 be
 baptized
 proves
 nothing
 so
 much
 as
 that
 there
 is
 a
 want
 of
 better
 argument
 for
 the
 conclusion
 would
 with
 more
 probability
 be
 derived
 thus
 Christ
 blessed
 infants
 and
 so
 dismissed
 them
 but
 baptized
 them
 not
 therefore
 infants
 are
 not
 to
 be
 baptizedThe

 The
 Camel
 and
 the
 Needles
 EyeIn
 comparing
 the
 difficulty
 of
 a
 rich
 man
 entering
 the
 kingdom
 with
 that
 of
 a
 camel
 passing
 through
 the
 eye
 of
 a
 needle
 Jesus
 used
 a
 rhetorical
 figure
 which
 strong
 and
 prohibitory
 as
 it
 appears
 in
 our
 translation
 was
 of
 a
 type
 familiar
 to
 those
 who
 heard
 the
 remark
 There
 was
 a
 common
 Jewish
 proverb
 that
 a
 man
 did
 not
 even
 in
 his
 dreams
 see
 an
 elephant
 pass
 through
 the
 eye
 of
 a
 needle
 Edersheim
 Some
 interpreters
 insist
 that
 a
 rope
 not
 a
 camel
 was
 mentioned
 by
 Jesus
 and
 these
 base
 their
 contention
 on
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 Greek
 word
 kamelos
 camel
 differs
 in
 but
 a
 single
 letter
 from
 kamilos
 rope
 and
 that
 the
 alleged
 error
 of
 substituting
 camel
 for
 rope
 in
 the
 scriptural
 text
 is
 chargeable
 to
 the
 early
 copyists
 Farrar
 p
 
 rejects
 this
 possible
 interpretation
 on
 the
 ground
 that
 proverbs
 involving
 comparisons
 of
 a
 kind
 with
 that
 of
 a
 camel
 passing
 through
 the
 eye
 of
 a
 needle
 are
 common
 in
 the
 Talmud
 It
 has
 been
 asserted
 that
 the
 term
 needles
 eye
 was
 applied
 to
 a
 small
 door
 or
 wicket
 set
 in
 or
 alongside
 the
 great
 gates
 in
 the
 walls
 of
 cities
 and
 the
 assumption
 has
 been
 raised
 that
 Jesus
 had
 such
 a
 wicket
 in
 mind
 when
 He
 spoke
 of
 the
 seeming
 impossibility
 of
 a
 camel
 passing
 through
 a
 needles
 eye
 It
 would
 be
 possible
 though
 very
 difficult
 for
 a
 camel
 to
 squeeze
 its
 way
 through
 the
 little
 gate
 and
 it
 could
 in
 no
 wise
 do
 so
 except
 when
 relieved
 of
 its
 load
 and
 stripped
 of
 all
 its
 harness
 If
 this
 conception
 be
 correct
 we
 may
 find
 additional
 similitude
 between
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 camel
 must
 first
 be
 unloaded
 and
 stripped
 however
 costly
 its
 burden
 or
 rich
 its
 accoutrement
 and
 the
 necessity
 of
 the
 rich
 young
 ruler
 and
 so
 of
 any
 man
 divesting
 himself
 of
 the
 burden
 and
 trappings
 of
 wealth
 if
 he
 would
 enter
 by
 the
 narrow
 way
 that
 leadeth
 into
 the
 kingdom
 The
 Lords
 exposition
 of
 His
 saying
 is
 allsufficient
 for
 the
 purposes
 of
 the
 lesson
 With
 men
 this
 is
 impossible
 but
 with
 God
 all
 things
 are
 possible

 Undue
 Concern
 as
 to
 Wages
 in
 the
 Lords
 ServiceThe
 instructive
 and
 inspiring
 Parable
 of
 the
 Laborers
 was
 called
 forth
 by
 Peters
 question
 of
 selfinterestWhat
 shall
 we
 have
 therefore
 In
 tender
 mercy
 the
 Lord
 refrained
 from
 directly
 rebuking
 His
 impulsive
 servant
 for
 undue
 concern
 as
 to
 the
 wage
 to
 be
 expected
 but
 He
 turned
 the
 incident
 to
 excellent
 purpose
 by
 making
 it
 the
 text
 of
 a
 valuable
 lesson
 The
 following
 treatment
 by
 Edersheim
 vol
 ii
 p
 
 is
 worth
 consideration
 There
 was
 here
 deep
 danger
 to
 the
 disciples
 danger
 of
 lapsing
 into
 feelings
 akin
 to
 those
 with
 which
 the
 Pharisees
 viewed
 the
 pardoned
 publicans
 or
 the
 elder
 son
 in
 the
 parable
 his
 younger
 brother
 danger
 of
 misunderstanding
 the
 right
 relations
 and
 with
 it
 the
 very
 character
 of
 the
 kingdom
 and
 of
 work
 in
 and
 for
 it
 It
 is
 to
 this
 that
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Laborers
 in
 the
 Vineyard
 refers
 The
 principle
 which
 Christ
 lays
 down
 is
 that
 while
 nothing
 done
 for
 Him
 shall
 lose
 its
 reward
 yet
 from
 one
 reason
 or
 another
 no
 forecast
 can
 be
 made
 no
 inferences
 of
 selfrighteousness
 may
 be
 drawn
 It
 does
 not
 by
 any
 means
 follow
 that
 most
 work
 doneat
 least
 to
 our
 seeing
 and
 judgingshall
 entail
 a
 greater
 reward
 On
 the
 contrary
 many
 that
 are
 first
 shall
 be
 last
 and
 the
 last
 shall
 be
 first
 Not
 all
 nor
 yet
 always
 and
 necessarily
 but
 many
 And
 in
 such
 cases
 no
 wrong
 has
 been
 done
 there
 exists
 no
 claim
 even
 in
 view
 of
 the
 promises
 of
 due
 acknowledgment
 of
 work
 Spiritual
 pride
 and
 self
 assertion
 can
 only
 be
 the
 outcome
 either
 of
 misunderstanding
 Gods
 relation
 to
 us
 or
 else
 of
 a
 wrong
 state
 of
 mind
 towards
 othersthat
 is
 it
 betokens
 mental
 or
 moral
 unfitness
 Of
 this
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Laborers
 is
 an
 illustration
 But
 while
 illustrating
 how
 it
 may
 come
 that
 some
 who
 were
 first
 are
 last
 and
 how
 utterly
 mistaken
 or
 wrong
 is
 the
 thought
 that
 they
 must
 necessarily
 receive
 more
 than
 others
 who
 seemingly
 have
 done
 morehow
 in
 short
 work
 for
 Christ
 is
 not
 a
 ponderable
 quantity
 so
 much
 for
 so
 much
 nor
 yet
 we
 be
 the
 judges
 of
 when
 and
 why
 a
 worker
 has
 comeit
 also
 conveys
 much
 that
 is
 new
 and
 in
 many
 respects
 most
 comforting

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 LAST
 WINTER
 AT
 THE
 FEAST
 OF
 DEDICATION
 Jesus
 returned
 to
 Jerusalem
 in
 time
 to
 attend
 the
 Feast
 of
 Dedication
 during
 the
 last
 winter
 of
 His
 earthly
 life
 This
 feast
 like
 that
 of
 Tabernacles
 was
 one
 of
 national
 rejoicing
 and
 was
 celebrated
 annually
 for
 a
 period
 of
 eight
 days
 beginning
 on
 the
 th
 of
 Chislev
 which
 corresponds
 in
 part
 to
 our
 December
 It
 was
 not
 one
 of
 the
 great
 feasts
 prescribed
 by
 Mosaic
 statute
 but
 had
 been
 established
 in
 
 or
 
 BC
 at
 the
 time
 of
 the
 rededication
 of
 the
 Temple
 of
 Zerubbabel
 following
 the
 rehabilitation
 of
 the
 sacred
 structure
 after
 its
 profane
 desecration
 by
 Antiochus
 Epiphanes
 the
 pagan
 king
 of
 Syria
 While
 the
 festival
 was
 in
 progress
 Jesus
 went
 to
 the
 temple
 and
 was
 seen
 walking
 in
 the
 part
 of
 the
 enclosure
 known
 as
 Solomons
 Porch
 His
 presence
 soon
 became
 known
 to
 the
 Jews
 who
 came
 crowding
 about
 Him
 in
 unfriendly
 spirit
 ostensibly
 to
 ask
 questions
 Their
 inquiry
 was
 How
 long
 dost
 thou
 make
 us
 to
 doubt
 If
 thou
 be
 the
 Christ
 tell
 us
 plainly
 The
 mere
 asking
 of
 such
 a
 question
 evidences
 the
 deep
 and
 disturbing
 impression
 which
 the
 ministry
 of
 Christ
 had
 produced
 among
 the
 official
 classes
 and
 the
 people
 generally
 in
 their
 estimation
 the
 works
 he
 had
 wrought
 appeared
 as
 worthy
 of
 the
 Messiah
 The
 Lords
 reply
 was
 indirect
 in
 form
 though
 in
 substance
 and
 effect
 incisive
 and
 unmistakable
 He
 referred
 them
 to
 His
 former
 utterances
 and
 to
 His
 continued
 works
 I
 told
 you
 He
 said
 and
 ye
 believed
 not
 the
 works
 that
 I
 do
 in
 my
 Fathers
 name
 they
 bear
 witness
 of
 me
 But
 ye
 believe
 not
 because
 ye
 are
 not
 of
 my
 sheep
 as
 I
 said
 unto
 you
 My
 sheep
 hear
 my
 voice
 and
 I
 know
 them
 and
 they
 follow
 me
 And
 I
 give
 unto
 them
 eternal
 life
 and
 they
 shall
 never
 perish
 neither
 shall
 any
 man
 pluck
 them
 out
 of
 my
 hand
 My
 Father
 which
 gave
 them
 me
 is
 greater
 than
 all
 and
 no
 man
 is
 able
 to
 pluck
 them
 out
 of
 my
 Fathers
 hand
 I
 and
 my
 Father
 are
 one
 The
 reference
 to
 what
 had
 been
 before
 told
 was
 a
 reminder
 of
 His
 teachings
 on
 the
 occasion
 of
 an
 earlier
 sojourn
 among
 them
 when
 He
 had
 proclaimed
 Himself
 as
 the
 I
 AM
 who
 was
 older
 and
 greater
 than
 Abraham
 and
 of
 His
 other
 proclamation
 of
 Himself
 as
 the
 Good
 Shepherd
 He
 could
 not
 well
 answer
 their
 inquiry
 by
 a
 simple
 unqualified
 affirmation
 for
 by
 such
 He
 would
 have
 been
 understood
 as
 meaning
 that
 He
 claimed
 to
 be
 the
 Messiah
 according
 to
 their
 conception
 the
 earthly
 king
 and
 conqueror
 for
 whom
 they
 professed
 to
 be
 looking
 He
 was
 no
 such
 Christ
 as
 they
 had
 in
 mind
 yet
 was
 He
 verily
 Shepherd
 and
 King
 to
 all
 who
 would
 hear
 His
 words
 and
 do
 His
 works
 and
 to
 such
 He
 renewed
 the
 promise
 of
 eternal
 life
 and
 the
 assurance
 that
 no
 man
 could
 pluck
 them
 out
 of
 His
 own
 or
 the
 Fathers
 hand
 To
 this
 doctrine
 both
 exalted
 and
 profound
 in
 scope
 the
 casuistical
 Jews
 could
 offer
 no
 refutation
 nor
 could
 they
 find
 therein
 the
 much
 desired
 excuse
 for
 open
 accusation
 our
 Lords
 concluding
 sentence
 however
 stirred
 the
 hostile
 throng
 to
 frenzy
 I
 and
 my
 Father
 are
 one
 was
 His
 solemn
 declaration
 In
 their
 rage
 they
 scrambled
 for
 stones
 wherewith
 to
 crush
 Him
 Owing
 to
 the
 unfinished
 state
 of
 the
 temple
 buildings
 there
 were
 probably
 many
 blocks
 and
 broken
 fragments
 of
 rock
 at
 hand
 and
 this
 was
 the
 second
 murderous
 attempt
 upon
 our
 Lords
 life
 within
 the
 purlieus
 of
 His
 Fathers
 House
 Fearless
 and
 with
 the
 compelling
 calmness
 of
 more
 than
 human
 majesty
 Jesus
 said
 Many
 good
 works
 have
 I
 shewed
 you
 from
 my
 Father
 for
 which
 of
 those
 works
 do
 ye
 stone
 me
 They
 angrily
 retorted
 For
 a
 good
 work
 we
 stone
 thee
 not
 but
 for
 blasphemy
 and
 because
 that
 thou
 being
 a
 man
 makest
 thyself
 God
 Plainly
 they
 had
 found
 no
 ambiguity
 in
 His
 words
 He
 then
 cited
 to
 them
 the
 scriptures
 wherein
 even
 judges
 empowered
 by
 divine
 authority
 are
 called
 gods
 and
 asked
 Is
 it
 not
 written
 in
 your
 law
 I
 said
 Ye
 are
 gods
 If
 he
 called
 them
 gods
 unto
 whom
 the
 word
 of
 God
 came
 and
 the
 scripture
 cannot
 be
 broken
 say
 ye
 of
 him
 whom
 the
 Father
 hath
 sanctified
 and
 sent
 into
 the
 world
 Thou
 blasphemest
 because
 I
 said
 I
 am
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 Then
 reverting
 to
 the
 first
 avouchment
 that
 His
 own
 commission
 was
 of
 the
 Father
 who
 is
 greater
 than
 all
 He
 added
 If
 I
 do
 not
 the
 works
 of
 my
 Father
 believe
 me
 not
 But
 if
 I
 do
 though
 ye
 believe
 not
 me
 believe
 the
 works
 that
 ye
 may
 know
 and
 believe
 that
 the
 Father
 is
 in
 me
 and
 I
 in
 him
 Again
 the
 Jews
 sought
 to
 take
 Him
 but
 were
 foiled
 by
 means
 not
 stated
 He
 passed
 from
 their
 reach
 and
 departed
 from
 the
 temple
 OUR
 LORDS
 RETIREMENT
 IN
 PEREA
 The
 violent
 hostility
 of
 the
 Jews
 in
 Jerusalem
 the
 headquarters
 of
 the
 theocracy
 was
 such
 that
 Jesus
 withdrew
 from
 the
 city
 and
 its
 neighborhood
 The
 day
 for
 His
 sacrifice
 had
 not
 yet
 come
 and
 while
 His
 enemies
 could
 not
 kill
 Him
 until
 He
 allowed
 Himself
 to
 be
 taken
 into
 their
 hands
 His
 work
 would
 be
 retarded
 by
 further
 hostile
 disturbances
 He
 retired
 to
 the
 place
 at
 which
 John
 the
 Baptist
 had
 begun
 his
 public
 ministry
 which
 is
 probably
 also
 the
 place
 of
 our
 Lords
 baptism
 The
 exact
 location
 is
 not
 specified
 it
 was
 certainly
 beyond
 Jordan
 and
 therefore
 in
 Perea
 We
 read
 that
 Jesus
 abode
 there
 and
 from
 this
 we
 gather
 that
 He
 remained
 in
 one
 general
 locality
 instead
 of
 traveling
 from
 town
 to
 town
 as
 had
 been
 His
 custom
 People
 resorted
 to
 Him
 even
 there
 however
 and
 many
 believed
 on
 Him
 The
 place
 was
 endeared
 to
 those
 who
 had
 gone
 to
 hear
 John
 and
 to
 be
 baptized
 by
 him
 and
 as
 these
 recalled
 the
 impassioned
 call
 to
 repentance
 the
 stirring
 proclamation
 of
 the
 kingdom
 by
 the
 now
 murdered
 and
 lamented
 Baptist
 they
 remembered
 his
 affirmation
 of
 One
 mightier
 than
 himself
 and
 saw
 in
 Jesus
 the
 realization
 of
 that
 testimony
 John
 they
 said
 did
 no
 miracle
 but
 all
 things
 that
 John
 spake
 of
 this
 man
 were
 true
 The
 duration
 of
 this
 sojourn
 in
 Perea
 is
 nowhere
 recorded
 in
 our
 scriptures
 It
 could
 not
 have
 lasted
 more
 than
 a
 few
 weeks
 at
 most
 Possibly
 some
 of
 the
 discourses
 instructions
 and
 parables
 already
 treated
 as
 following
 the
 Lords
 departure
 from
 Jerusalem
 after
 the
 Feast
 of
 Tabernacles
 in
 the
 preceding
 autumn
 may
 chronologically
 belong
 to
 this
 interval
 From
 this
 retreat
 of
 comparative
 quiet
 Jesus
 returned
 to
 Judea
 in
 response
 to
 an
 earnest
 appeal
 from
 some
 whom
 He
 loved
 He
 left
 the
 Bethany
 of
 Perea
 for
 the
 Judean
 Bethany
 where
 dwelt
 Martha
 and
 Mary
 LAZARUS
 RESTORED
 TO
 LIFE
 Lazarus
 the
 brother
 of
 Mary
 and
 Martha
 lay
 ill
 in
 the
 family
 home
 at
 Bethany
 of
 Judea
 His
 devoted
 sisters
 sent
 a
 messenger
 to
 Jesus
 with
 the
 simple
 announcement
 in
 which
 however
 we
 cannot
 fail
 to
 recognize
 a
 pitiful
 appeal
 Lord
 behold
 he
 whom
 thou
 lovest
 is
 sick
 When
 Jesus
 received
 the
 message
 He
 remarked
 This
 sickness
 is
 not
 unto
 death
 but
 for
 the
 glory
 of
 God
 that
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 might
 be
 glorified
 thereby
 This
 was
 probably
 the
 word
 carried
 back
 to
 the
 sisters
 whom
 Jesus
 loved
 Lazarus
 had
 died
 in
 the
 interval
 indeed
 he
 must
 have
 expired
 soon
 after
 the
 messenger
 had
 started
 with
 the
 tidings
 of
 the
 young
 mans
 illness
 The
 Lord
 knew
 that
 Lazarus
 was
 dead
 yet
 He
 tarried
 where
 He
 was
 for
 two
 days
 after
 receiving
 the
 word
 then
 He
 surprized
 the
 disciples
 by
 saying
 Let
 us
 go
 into
 Judea
 again
 They
 sought
 to
 dissuade
 the
 Master
 by
 reminding
 Him
 of
 the
 recent
 attempt
 upon
 His
 life
 at
 Jerusalem
 and
 asked
 wonderingly
 Goest
 thou
 thither
 again
 Jesus
 made
 clear
 to
 them
 that
 He
 was
 not
 to
 be
 deterred
 from
 duty
 in
 the
 time
 thereof
 nor
 should
 others
 be
 for
 as
 He
 illustrated
 the
 working
 day
 is
 twelve
 hours
 long
 and
 during
 that
 period
 a
 man
 may
 walk
 without
 stumbling
 for
 he
 walks
 in
 the
 light
 but
 if
 he
 let
 the
 hours
 pass
 and
 then
 try
 to
 walk
 or
 work
 in
 darkness
 he
 stumbles
 It
 was
 then
 His
 day
 to
 work
 and
 He
 was
 making
 no
 mistake
 in
 returning
 to
 Judea
 He
 added
 Our
 friend
 Lazarus
 sleepeth
 but
 I
 go
 that
 I
 may
 awake
 him
 out
 of
 sleep
 The
 simile
 between
 death
 and
 sleep
 was
 as
 common
 among
 the
 Jews
 as
 with
 us
 but
 the
 disciples
 construed
 the
 saying
 literally
 and
 remarked
 that
 if
 the
 sick
 man
 was
 sleeping
 it
 would
 be
 well
 with
 him
 Jesus
 set
 them
 right
 Lazarus
 is
 dead
 He
 said
 and
 added
 And
 I
 am
 glad
 for
 your
 sakes
 that
 I
 was
 not
 there
 to
 the
 intent
 ye
 may
 believe
 nevertheless
 let
 us
 go
 unto
 him
 It
 is
 evident
 that
 Jesus
 had
 already
 decided
 to
 restore
 Lazarus
 to
 life
 and
 as
 we
 shall
 see
 the
 miracle
 was
 to
 be
 a
 testimony
 of
 our
 Lords
 Messiahship
 convincing
 to
 all
 who
 would
 accept
 it
 A
 return
 to
 Judea
 at
 that
 time
 was
 viewed
 by
 at
 least
 some
 of
 the
 apostles
 with
 serious
 apprehension
 they
 feared
 for
 their
 Masters
 safety
 and
 thought
 that
 their
 own
 lives
 would
 be
 in
 peril
 nevertheless
 they
 did
 not
 hesitate
 to
 go
 Thomas
 boldly
 said
 to
 the
 others
 Let
 us
 also
 go
 that
 we
 may
 die
 with
 him
 Arriving
 on
 the
 outskirts
 of
 Bethany
 Jesus
 found
 that
 Lazarus
 had
 lain
 in
 the
 grave
 four
 days
 already
 The
 bereaved
 sisters
 were
 at
 home
 where
 had
 gathered
 according
 to
 custom
 friends
 to
 console
 them
 in
 their
 grief
 Among
 these
 were
 many
 prominent
 people
 some
 of
 whom
 had
 come
 from
 Jerusalem
 Word
 of
 the
 Masters
 approach
 reached
 Martha
 first
 and
 she
 hastened
 to
 meet
 Him
 Her
 first
 words
 were
 Lord
 if
 thou
 hadst
 been
 here
 my
 brother
 had
 not
 died
 It
 was
 an
 expression
 of
 anguish
 combined
 with
 faith
 but
 lest
 it
 appear
 as
 lacking
 in
 trust
 she
 hastened
 to
 add
 But
 I
 know
 that
 even
 now
 whatsoever
 thou
 wilt
 ask
 of
 God
 God
 will
 give
 it
 thee
 Then
 said
 Jesus
 in
 words
 of
 assuring
 tenderness
 Thy
 brother
 shall
 rise
 again
 Perhaps
 some
 of
 the
 Jews
 who
 had
 come
 to
 comfort
 her
 had
 said
 as
 much
 for
 they
 the
 Sadducees
 excepted
 believed
 in
 a
 resurrection
 and
 Martha
 failed
 to
 find
 in
 the
 Lords
 promise
 anything
 more
 than
 a
 general
 assurance
 that
 her
 departed
 brother
 should
 be
 raised
 with
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 dead
 In
 natural
 and
 seemingly
 casual
 assent
 she
 remarked
 I
 know
 that
 he
 shall
 rise
 again
 in
 the
 resurrection
 at
 the
 last
 day
 Then
 said
 Jesus
 I
 am
 the
 resurrection
 and
 the
 life
 he
 that
 believeth
 in
 me
 though
 he
 were
 dead
 yet
 shall
 he
 live
 And
 whosoever
 liveth
 and
 believeth
 in
 me
 shall
 never
 die
 Believest
 thou
 this
 The
 sorrowing
 womans
 faith
 had
 to
 be
 lifted
 and
 centered
 in
 the
 Lord
 of
 Life
 with
 whom
 she
 was
 speaking
 She
 had
 before
 confessed
 her
 conviction
 that
 whatever
 Jesus
 asked
 of
 God
 would
 be
 granted
 she
 had
 to
 learn
 that
 unto
 Jesus
 had
 already
 been
 committed
 power
 over
 life
 and
 death
 She
 was
 hopefully
 expectant
 of
 some
 superhuman
 interposition
 by
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 in
 her
 behalf
 yet
 she
 knew
 not
 what
 that
 might
 be
 Apparently
 at
 this
 time
 she
 had
 no
 welldefined
 thought
 or
 even
 hope
 that
 He
 would
 call
 her
 brother
 from
 the
 tomb
 To
 the
 Lords
 question
 as
 to
 whether
 she
 believed
 what
 He
 had
 just
 said
 she
 answered
 with
 simple
 frankness
 all
 of
 it
 she
 was
 not
 able
 to
 understand
 but
 she
 believed
 in
 the
 Speaker
 even
 while
 unable
 to
 fully
 comprehend
 His
 words
 Yea
 Lord
 she
 said
 I
 believe
 that
 thou
 art
 the
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 which
 should
 come
 into
 the
 world
 Then
 she
 returned
 to
 the
 home
 and
 with
 precaution
 of
 secrecy
 on
 account
 of
 the
 presence
 of
 some
 whom
 she
 knew
 to
 be
 unfriendly
 to
 Jesus
 said
 to
 Mary
 The
 Master
 is
 come
 and
 calleth
 for
 thee
 Mary
 left
 the
 house
 in
 haste
 The
 Jews
 who
 had
 been
 with
 her
 thought
 that
 she
 had
 been
 impelled
 by
 a
 fresh
 resurgence
 of
 grief
 to
 go
 again
 to
 the
 grave
 and
 they
 followed
 her
 When
 she
 reached
 the
 Master
 she
 knelt
 at
 His
 feet
 and
 gave
 expression
 to
 her
 consuming
 sorrow
 in
 the
 very
 words
 Martha
 had
 used
 Lord
 if
 thou
 hadst
 been
 here
 my
 brother
 had
 not
 died
 We
 cannot
 doubt
 that
 the
 conviction
 so
 voiced
 had
 been
 the
 burden
 of
 comment
 and
 lamentation
 between
 the
 two
 sistersif
 only
 Jesus
 had
 been
 with
 them
 they
 would
 not
 have
 been
 bereft
 of
 their
 brother
 The
 sight
 of
 the
 two
 women
 so
 overcome
 by
 grief
 and
 of
 the
 people
 wailing
 with
 them
 caused
 Jesus
 to
 sorrow
 so
 that
 He
 groaned
 in
 spirit
 and
 was
 deeply
 troubled
 Where
 have
 ye
 laid
 him
 He
 asked
 and
 Jesus
 wept
 As
 the
 sorrowing
 company
 went
 toward
 the
 tomb
 some
 of
 the
 Jews
 observing
 the
 Lords
 emotion
 and
 tears
 said
 Behold
 how
 he
 loved
 him
 but
 others
 less
 sympathetic
 because
 of
 their
 prejudice
 against
 Christ
 asked
 critically
 and
 reproachfully
 Could
 not
 this
 man
 which
 opened
 the
 eyes
 of
 the
 blind
 have
 caused
 that
 even
 this
 man
 should
 not
 have
 died
 The
 miracle
 by
 which
 a
 man
 blind
 from
 birth
 had
 been
 made
 to
 see
 was
 very
 generally
 known
 largely
 because
 of
 the
 official
 investigation
 that
 had
 followed
 the
 healing
 The
 Jews
 had
 been
 compelled
 to
 admit
 the
 actuality
 of
 the
 astounding
 occurrence
 and
 the
 question
 now
 raised
 as
 to
 whether
 or
 why
 One
 who
 could
 accomplish
 such
 a
 wonder
 could
 not
 have
 preserved
 from
 death
 a
 man
 stricken
 with
 an
 ordinary
 illness
 and
 that
 man
 one
 whom
 He
 seemed
 to
 have
 dearly
 loved
 was
 an
 innuendo
 that
 the
 power
 possessed
 by
 Jesus
 was
 after
 all
 limited
 and
 of
 uncertain
 or
 capricious
 operation
 This
 manifestation
 of
 malignant
 unbelief
 caused
 Jesus
 again
 to
 groan
 with
 sorrow
 if
 not
 indignation
 The
 body
 of
 Lazarus
 had
 been
 interred
 in
 a
 cave
 the
 entrance
 to
 which
 was
 closed
 by
 a
 great
 block
 of
 stone
 Such
 burialplaces
 were
 common
 in
 that
 country
 natural
 caves
 or
 vaults
 hewn
 in
 the
 solid
 rock
 being
 used
 as
 sepulchres
 by
 the
 better
 classes
 of
 people
 Jesus
 directed
 that
 the
 tomb
 be
 opened
 Martha
 still
 unprepared
 for
 what
 was
 to
 follow
 ventured
 to
 remonstrate
 reminding
 Jesus
 that
 the
 corpse
 had
 been
 four
 days
 immured
 and
 that
 decomposition
 must
 have
 already
 set
 in
 Jesus
 thus
 met
 her
 objection
 Said
 I
 not
 unto
 thee
 that
 if
 thou
 wouldest
 believe
 thou
 shouldest
 see
 the
 glory
 of
 God
 This
 may
 have
 had
 reference
 both
 to
 His
 promise
 spoken
 to
 Martha
 in
 personthat
 her
 brother
 should
 rise
 againand
 to
 the
 message
 sent
 from
 Pereathat
 the
 illness
 of
 Lazarus
 was
 not
 unto
 final
 death
 at
 that
 time
 but
 for
 the
 glory
 of
 God
 and
 that
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 might
 be
 glorified
 thereby
 The
 stone
 was
 removed
 Standing
 before
 the
 open
 portal
 of
 the
 tomb
 Jesus
 looked
 upward
 and
 prayed
 Father
 I
 thank
 thee
 that
 thou
 hast
 heard
 me
 And
 I
 knew
 that
 thou
 hearest
 me
 always
 but
 because
 of
 the
 people
 which
 stand
 by
 I
 said
 it
 that
 they
 may
 believe
 that
 thou
 hast
 sent
 me
 He
 did
 not
 ask
 the
 Father
 for
 power
 or
 authority
 such
 had
 already
 been
 given
 Him
 but
 He
 gave
 thanks
 and
 in
 the
 hearing
 of
 all
 who
 stood
 by
 acknowledged
 the
 Father
 and
 expressed
 the
 oneness
 of
 His
 own
 and
 the
 Fathers
 purposes
 Then
 with
 a
 loud
 voice
 He
 cried
 Lazarus
 come
 forth
 The
 dead
 man
 heard
 that
 voice
 of
 authoritative
 command
 the
 spirit
 straightway
 reentered
 the
 tabernacle
 of
 flesh
 the
 physical
 processes
 of
 life
 were
 resumed
 and
 Lazarus
 again
 alive
 came
 forth
 His
 freedom
 of
 motion
 was
 limited
 for
 the
 grave
 clothes
 hampered
 his
 movements
 and
 his
 face
 was
 still
 bound
 by
 the
 napkin
 by
 which
 the
 lifeless
 jaw
 had
 been
 held
 in
 place
 To
 those
 who
 stood
 near
 Jesus
 said
 Loose
 him
 and
 let
 him
 go
 The
 procedure
 throughout
 was
 characterized
 by
 deep
 solemnity
 and
 by
 the
 entire
 absence
 of
 every
 element
 of
 unnecessary
 display
 Jesus
 who
 when
 miles
 away
 and
 without
 any
 ordinary
 means
 of
 receiving
 the
 information
 knew
 that
 Lazarus
 was
 dead
 doubtless
 could
 have
 found
 the
 tomb
 yet
 He
 inquired
 Where
 have
 ye
 laid
 him
 He
 who
 could
 still
 the
 waves
 of
 the
 sea
 by
 a
 word
 could
 have
 miraculously
 effected
 the
 removal
 of
 the
 stone
 that
 sealed
 the
 mouth
 of
 the
 sepulchre
 yet
 He
 said
 Take
 ye
 away
 the
 stone
 He
 who
 could
 reunite
 spirit
 and
 body
 could
 have
 loosened
 without
 hands
 the
 cerements
 by
 which
 the
 reanimated
 Lazarus
 was
 bound
 yet
 He
 said
 Loose
 him
 and
 let
 him
 go
 All
 that
 human
 agency
 could
 do
 was
 left
 to
 man
 In
 no
 instance
 do
 we
 find
 that
 Christ
 used
 unnecessarily
 the
 superhuman
 powers
 of
 His
 Godship
 the
 divine
 energy
 was
 never
 wasted
 even
 the
 material
 creation
 resulting
 from
 its
 exercize
 was
 conserved
 as
 witness
 His
 instructions
 regarding
 the
 gathering
 up
 of
 the
 fragments
 of
 bread
 and
 fish
 after
 the
 multitudes
 had
 been
 miraculously
 fed
 The
 raising
 of
 Lazarus
 stands
 as
 the
 third
 recorded
 instance
 of
 restoration
 to
 life
 by
 Jesus
 In
 each
 the
 miracle
 resulted
 in
 a
 resumption
 of
 mortal
 existence
 and
 was
 in
 no
 sense
 a
 resurrection
 from
 death
 to
 immortality
 In
 the
 raising
 of
 the
 daughter
 of
 Jairus
 the
 spirit
 was
 recalled
 to
 its
 tenement
 within
 the
 hour
 of
 its
 quitting
 the
 raising
 of
 the
 widows
 son
 is
 an
 instance
 of
 restoration
 when
 the
 corpse
 was
 ready
 for
 the
 grave
 the
 crowning
 miracle
 of
 the
 three
 was
 the
 calling
 of
 a
 spirit
 to
 reenter
 its
 body
 days
 after
 death
 and
 when
 by
 natural
 processes
 the
 corpse
 would
 be
 already
 in
 the
 early
 stages
 of
 decomposition
 Lazarus
 was
 raised
 from
 the
 dead
 not
 simply
 to
 assuage
 the
 grief
 of
 mourning
 relatives
 myriads
 have
 had
 to
 mourn
 over
 death
 and
 so
 myriads
 more
 shall
 have
 to
 do
 One
 of
 the
 Lords
 purposes
 was
 that
 of
 demonstrating
 the
 actuality
 of
 the
 power
 of
 God
 as
 shown
 forth
 in
 the
 works
 of
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 and
 Lazarus
 was
 the
 accepted
 subject
 of
 the
 manifestation
 just
 as
 the
 man
 afflicted
 with
 congenital
 blindness
 had
 been
 chosen
 to
 be
 the
 one
 through
 whom
 the
 works
 of
 God
 should
 be
 made
 manifest
 That
 the
 Lords
 act
 of
 restoring
 Lazarus
 to
 life
 was
 of
 effect
 in
 testifying
 to
 His
 Messiahship
 is
 explicitly
 stated
 All
 the
 circumstances
 leading
 up
 to
 final
 culmination
 in
 the
 miracle
 contributed
 to
 its
 attestation
 No
 question
 as
 to
 the
 actual
 death
 of
 Lazarus
 could
 be
 raised
 for
 his
 demise
 had
 been
 witnessed
 his
 body
 had
 been
 prepared
 and
 buried
 in
 the
 usual
 way
 and
 he
 had
 lain
 in
 the
 grave
 four
 days
 At
 the
 tomb
 when
 he
 was
 called
 forth
 there
 were
 many
 witnesses
 some
 of
 them
 prominent
 Jews
 many
 of
 whom
 were
 unfriendly
 to
 Jesus
 and
 who
 would
 have
 readily
 denied
 the
 miracle
 had
 they
 been
 able
 God
 was
 glorified
 and
 the
 divinity
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 was
 vindicated
 in
 the
 result
 THE
 HIERARCHY
 GREATLY
 AGITATED
 OVER
 THE
 MIRACLE
 As
 in
 connection
 with
 most
 of
 our
 Lords
 public
 actswhile
 some
 of
 those
 who
 heard
 and
 saw
 were
 brought
 to
 believe
 in
 Him
 others
 rejected
 the
 proffered
 lesson
 and
 reviled
 the
 Masterso
 with
 this
 mighty
 worksome
 were
 stirred
 to
 faith
 and
 others
 went
 their
 ways
 each
 with
 mind
 darkened
 and
 spirit
 more
 malignant
 than
 ever
 Some
 of
 those
 who
 had
 seen
 the
 dead
 man
 raised
 to
 life
 went
 immediately
 and
 reported
 the
 matter
 to
 the
 rulers
 whom
 they
 knew
 to
 be
 intensely
 hostile
 toward
 Jesus
 In
 the
 parable
 we
 have
 recently
 studied
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 rich
 man
 pleaded
 from
 his
 place
 of
 anguish
 that
 Lazarus
 the
 once
 pitiable
 beggar
 be
 sent
 from
 paradise
 to
 earth
 to
 warn
 others
 of
 the
 fate
 awaiting
 the
 wicked
 to
 which
 appeal
 Abraham
 replied
 If
 they
 hear
 not
 Moses
 and
 the
 prophets
 neither
 will
 they
 be
 persuaded
 though
 one
 rose
 from
 the
 dead
 Now
 a
 Lazarus
 had
 been
 in
 reality
 raised
 from
 the
 dead
 and
 many
 of
 the
 Jews
 rejected
 the
 testimony
 of
 his
 return
 and
 refused
 to
 believe
 in
 Christ
 through
 whom
 alone
 death
 is
 overcome
 The
 Jews
 tried
 to
 get
 Lazarus
 into
 their
 power
 that
 they
 might
 kill
 him
 and
 as
 they
 hoped
 silence
 forever
 his
 testimony
 of
 the
 Lords
 power
 over
 death
 The
 chief
 priests
 who
 were
 mostly
 Sadducees
 and
 the
 Pharisees
 with
 them
 assembled
 in
 council
 to
 consider
 the
 situation
 created
 by
 this
 latest
 of
 our
 Lords
 great
 works
 The
 question
 they
 discussed
 was
 What
 do
 we
 for
 this
 man
 doeth
 many
 miracles
 If
 we
 let
 him
 thus
 alone
 all
 men
 will
 believe
 on
 him
 and
 the
 Romans
 shall
 come
 and
 take
 away
 both
 our
 place
 and
 nation
 As
 stated
 by
 themselves
 there
 was
 no
 denying
 the
 fact
 of
 the
 many
 miracles
 wrought
 by
 Jesus
 but
 instead
 of
 earnestly
 and
 prayerfully
 investigating
 as
 to
 whether
 these
 mighty
 works
 were
 not
 among
 the
 predicted
 characteristics
 of
 the
 Messiah
 they
 thought
 only
 of
 the
 possible
 effect
 of
 Christs
 influence
 in
 alienating
 the
 people
 from
 the
 established
 theocracy
 and
 of
 the
 fear
 that
 the
 Romans
 taking
 advantage
 of
 the
 situation
 would
 deprive
 the
 hierarchs
 of
 their
 place
 and
 take
 from
 the
 nation
 what
 little
 semblance
 of
 distinct
 autonomy
 it
 still
 possessed
 Caiaphas
 the
 high
 priest
 cut
 short
 the
 discussion
 by
 saying
 Ye
 know
 nothing
 at
 all
 This
 sweeping
 assertion
 of
 ignorance
 was
 most
 likely
 addressed
 to
 the
 Pharisees
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 Caiaphas
 was
 a
 Sadducee
 His
 next
 utterance
 was
 of
 greater
 significance
 than
 he
 realized
 Nor
 consider
 that
 it
 is
 expedient
 for
 us
 that
 one
 man
 should
 die
 for
 the
 people
 and
 that
 the
 whole
 nation
 perish
 not
 John
 solemnly
 avers
 that
 Caiaphas
 spake
 not
 of
 himself
 but
 by
 the
 spirit
 of
 prophecy
 which
 in
 spite
 of
 his
 implied
 unworthiness
 came
 upon
 him
 by
 virtue
 of
 his
 office
 and
 that
 thus
 He
 prophesied
 that
 Jesus
 should
 die
 for
 that
 nation
 and
 not
 for
 that
 nation
 only
 but
 that
 also
 he
 should
 gather
 together
 in
 one
 the
 children
 of
 God
 that
 were
 scattered
 abroad
 But
 a
 few
 years
 after
 Christ
 had
 been
 put
 to
 death
 for
 the
 salvation
 of
 the
 Jews
 and
 of
 all
 other
 nations
 the
 very
 calamities
 which
 Caiaphas
 and
 the
 Sanhedrin
 had
 hoped
 to
 avert
 befell
 in
 full
 measure
 the
 hierarchy
 was
 overthrown
 the
 temple
 destroyed
 Jerusalem
 demolished
 and
 the
 nation
 disrupted
 From
 the
 day
 of
 that
 memorable
 session
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 the
 rulers
 increased
 their
 efforts
 to
 bring
 about
 the
 death
 of
 Jesus
 by
 whatever
 means
 they
 might
 find
 available
 They
 issued
 a
 mandate
 that
 whosoever
 knew
 of
 His
 whereabouts
 should
 give
 the
 information
 to
 the
 officials
 that
 they
 might
 promptly
 take
 Him
 into
 custody
 JESUS
 IN
 RETIREMENT
 AT
 EPHRAIM
 The
 hostility
 of
 the
 ecclesiastical
 rulers
 became
 so
 great
 that
 Jesus
 once
 more
 sought
 retirement
 in
 a
 region
 sufficiently
 far
 from
 Jerusalem
 to
 afford
 Him
 security
 from
 the
 watchful
 and
 malignant
 eyes
 of
 His
 powerful
 and
 openly
 avowed
 enemies
 But
 a
 few
 weeks
 of
 mortal
 life
 remained
 to
 Him
 and
 the
 greater
 part
 of
 this
 brief
 period
 had
 to
 be
 devoted
 to
 the
 further
 instruction
 of
 the
 apostles
 He
 prudently
 withdrew
 from
 the
 vicinity
 of
 Bethany
 and
 went
 thence
 unto
 a
 country
 near
 to
 the
 wilderness
 into
 a
 city
 called
 Ephraim
 and
 there
 continued
 with
 his
 disciples
 Thus
 did
 our
 Lord
 spend
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 winter
 and
 probably
 the
 early
 days
 of
 the
 succeeding
 spring
 That
 His
 retreat
 was
 private
 if
 not
 practically
 secret
 is
 suggested
 by
 Johns
 statement
 that
 Jesus
 therefore
 walked
 no
 more
 openly
 among
 the
 Jews
 and
 further
 indication
 is
 found
 in
 the
 fact
 that
 although
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 Pharisees
 had
 virtually
 set
 a
 price
 upon
 His
 head
 no
 man
 gave
 information
 as
 to
 His
 whereabouts
 The
 place
 of
 this
 last
 retirement
 is
 not
 definitely
 known
 it
 is
 generally
 thought
 to
 be
 the
 locality
 elsewhere
 called
 Ephrain
 and
 Ephron
 which
 lay
 a
 little
 less
 than
 twenty
 miles
 northerly
 from
 Jerusalem
 Equally
 uncertain
 is
 the
 duration
 of
 our
 Lords
 abode
 there
 When
 He
 emerged
 again
 into
 public
 notice
 it
 was
 to
 enter
 upon
 His
 solemn
 march
 toward
 Jerusalem
 and
 the
 cross

 CHAPTER
 
 
 Origin
 of
 the
 Feast
 of
 DedicationConcerning
 the
 second
 temple
 known
 as
 the
 Temple
 of
 Zerubbabel
 the
 author
 has
 written
 elsewhere
 Of
 the
 later
 history
 of
 this
 temple
 the
 biblical
 record
 gives
 but
 few
 details
 but
 from
 other
 sources
 we
 learn
 of
 its
 vicissitudes
 In
 connection
 with
 the
 Maccabean
 persecution
 the
 House
 of
 the
 Lord
 was
 profaned
 A
 Syrian
 king
 Antiochus
 Epiphanes
 captured
 Jerusalem
 
 to
 
 BC
 and
 perpetrated
 blasphemous
 outrage
 against
 the
 religion
 of
 the
 people
 He
 plundered
 the
 temple
 and
 carried
 away
 its
 golden
 candlestick
 its
 golden
 altar
 of
 incense
 its
 table
 of
 shewbread
 and
 even
 tore
 down
 the
 sacred
 veils
 which
 were
 of
 fine
 linen
 and
 scarlet
 His
 malignity
 was
 carried
 so
 far
 that
 he
 purposely
 desecrated
 the
 altar
 of
 sacrifice
 by
 offering
 swine
 thereon
 and
 erected
 a
 heathen
 altar
 within
 the
 sacred
 enclosure
 Not
 content
 with
 the
 violation
 of
 the
 temple
 this
 wicked
 monarch
 had
 altars
 erected
 in
 the
 towns
 and
 ordered
 the
 offering
 of
 unclean
 beasts
 upon
 them
 The
 rite
 of
 circumcision
 was
 forbidden
 on
 pain
 of
 death
 and
 the
 worship
 of
 Jehovah
 was
 declared
 a
 crime
 As
 a
 result
 of
 this
 persecution
 many
 of
 the
 Jews
 apostatized
 and
 declared
 that
 they
 belonged
 to
 the
 Medes
 and
 Persiansthe
 nations
 from
 whose
 dominion
 they
 had
 been
 delivered
 by
 the
 power
 of
 God
 Then
 in
 the
 year
 
 BC
 the
 House
 was
 rededicated
 and
 the
 occasion
 was
 remembered
 in
 annual
 festival
 thereafter
 under
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Feast
 of
 DedicationThe
 House
 of
 the
 Lord
 pp
 
 According
 to
 Josephus
 Ant
 xii
 
 the
 festival
 came
 to
 be
 known
 as
 The
 Lights
 and
 brilliant
 illumination
 both
 of
 the
 temple
 and
 of
 dwellings
 was
 a
 feature
 of
 the
 celebration
 Traditional
 accounts
 say
 that
 eight
 days
 had
 been
 set
 as
 the
 duration
 of
 the
 feast
 in
 commemoration
 of
 a
 legendary
 miracle
 by
 which
 the
 consecrated
 oil
 in
 the
 only
 jar
 found
 intact
 and
 bearing
 the
 unbroken
 seal
 of
 the
 high
 priest
 had
 been
 made
 to
 serve
 for
 temple
 purposes
 through
 eight
 days
 which
 time
 was
 required
 for
 the
 ceremonial
 preparation
 of
 a
 new
 supply
 
 Solomons
 PorchThis
 name
 had
 been
 applied
 to
 the
 eastern
 colonnade
 or
 row
 of
 porticoes
 within
 the
 temple
 enclosure
 in
 recognition
 of
 a
 tradition
 that
 the
 porch
 covered
 and
 included
 a
 portion
 of
 the
 original
 wall
 belonging
 to
 the
 Temple
 of
 Solomon

 The
 Place
 of
 our
 Lords
 RetirementJesus
 went
 beyond
 Jordan
 into
 the
 place
 where
 John
 at
 first
 baptized
 John
 
 This
 was
 probably
 Bethabara
 
 which
 is
 called
 Bethany
 in
 some
 of
 the
 earliest
 manuscripts
 and
 is
 so
 designated
 in
 the
 latest
 revised
 version
 Care
 must
 be
 taken
 not
 to
 confuse
 this
 Perean
 Bethany
 with
 the
 Bethany
 in
 Judea
 the
 home
 of
 Martha
 and
 Mary
 which
 was
 within
 two
 miles
 of
 Jerusalem
 
 Lazarus
 in
 the
 Tomb
 Four
 DaysOn
 the
 very
 probable
 assumption
 that
 the
 journey
 from
 Bethany
 in
 Judea
 to
 the
 place
 where
 Jesus
 was
 in
 Perea
 would
 require
 one
 day
 Lazarus
 must
 have
 died
 on
 the
 day
 of
 the
 messengers
 departure
 for
 this
 day
 and
 the
 two
 days
 that
 elapsed
 before
 Jesus
 started
 toward
 Judea
 and
 the
 day
 required
 for
 the
 return
 would
 no
 more
 than
 cover
 the
 four
 days
 specified
 It
 was
 and
 still
 is
 the
 custom
 in
 Palestine
 as
 in
 other
 oriental
 countries
 to
 bury
 on
 the
 day
 of
 death
 It
 was
 the
 popular
 belief
 that
 on
 the
 fourth
 day
 after
 death
 the
 spirit
 had
 finally
 departed
 from
 the
 vicinity
 of
 the
 corpse
 and
 that
 thereafter
 decomposition
 proceeded
 unhindered
 This
 may
 explain
 Marthas
 impulsive
 though
 gentle
 objection
 to
 having
 the
 tomb
 of
 her
 brother
 opened
 four
 days
 after
 his
 death
 John
 
 It
 is
 possible
 that
 the
 consent
 of
 the
 next
 of
 kin
 was
 required
 for
 the
 lawful
 opening
 of
 a
 grave
 Both
 Martha
 and
 Mary
 were
 present
 and
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 many
 witnesses
 assented
 to
 the
 opening
 of
 the
 tomb
 in
 which
 their
 brother
 lay
 
 Jesus
 Groaned
 in
 SpiritThe
 marginal
 readings
 for
 he
 groaned
 in
 the
 spirit
 John
 
 and
 again
 groaning
 in
 himself
 v
 
 as
 given
 in
 the
 revised
 version
 are
 was
 moved
 with
 indignation
 in
 the
 spirit
 and
 being
 moved
 with
 indignation
 in
 himself
 All
 philological
 authorities
 agree
 that
 the
 words
 in
 the
 original
 Greek
 express
 sorrowful
 indignation
 or
 as
 some
 aver
 anger
 and
 not
 alone
 a
 sympathetic
 emotion
 of
 grief
 Any
 indignation
 the
 Lord
 may
 have
 felt
 as
 intimated
 in
 verse
 
 may
 be
 attributed
 to
 disapproval
 of
 the
 customary
 wailing
 over
 death
 which
 as
 vented
 by
 the
 Jews
 on
 this
 occasion
 profaned
 the
 real
 and
 soulful
 grief
 of
 Martha
 and
 Mary
 and
 His
 indignation
 expressed
 by
 groaning
 as
 mentioned
 in
 verse
 
 may
 have
 been
 due
 to
 the
 carping
 criticism
 uttered
 by
 some
 of
 the
 Jews
 as
 recorded
 in
 verse
 
 
 Caiaphas
 High
 Priest
 that
 YearJohns
 statement
 that
 Caiaphas
 was
 high
 priest
 that
 same
 year
 must
 not
 be
 construed
 as
 meaning
 that
 the
 office
 of
 high
 priest
 was
 of
 a
 single
 years
 tenure
 Under
 Jewish
 law
 the
 presiding
 priest
 who
 was
 known
 as
 the
 high
 priest
 would
 remain
 in
 office
 indefinitely
 but
 the
 Roman
 government
 had
 arrogated
 to
 itself
 the
 appointive
 power
 as
 applying
 to
 this
 office
 and
 frequent
 changes
 were
 made
 This
 Caiaphas
 whose
 full
 name
 was
 Josephus
 Caiaphas
 was
 high
 priest
 under
 Roman
 appointment
 during
 a
 period
 of
 eleven
 years
 To
 such
 appointments
 the
 Jews
 had
 to
 submit
 though
 they
 often
 recognized
 as
 the
 high
 priest
 under
 their
 law
 some
 other
 than
 the
 civil
 high
 priest
 appointed
 by
 Roman
 authority
 Thus
 we
 find
 both
 Annas
 and
 Caiaphas
 exercizing
 the
 authority
 of
 the
 office
 at
 the
 time
 of
 our
 Lords
 arrest
 and
 later
 John
 
 
 Acts
 
 compare
 Luke
 
 Farrar
 p
 
 note
 says
 Some
 have
 seen
 an
 open
 irony
 in
 the
 expression
 of
 St
 John
 
 that
 Caiaphas
 was
 high
 priest
 that
 same
 year
 as
 though
 the
 Jews
 had
 got
 into
 this
 contemptuous
 way
 of
 speaking
 during
 the
 rapid
 succession
 of
 priestsmere
 phantoms
 set
 up
 and
 displaced
 by
 the
 Roman
 fiatwho
 had
 in
 recent
 years
 succeeded

 The
 inconsistency
 of

 human
 judges
 gods

 of

 Christ
 who
 called
 Himself
 the

 have

 the
 Jews

 for
 their
 sindarkened
 minds

 CHAPTER
 
 ON
 TO
 JERUSALEM
 JESUS
 AGAIN
 FORTELLS
 HIS
 DEATH
 AND
 RESURRECTION
 Each
 of
 the
 three
 synoptic
 writers
 has
 made
 record
 of
 this
 last
 journey
 to
 Jerusalem
 and
 of
 occurrences
 connected
 therewith
 The
 deep
 solemnity
 of
 the
 developments
 now
 so
 near
 at
 hand
 and
 of
 the
 fate
 He
 was
 setting
 out
 to
 meet
 so
 affected
 Jesus
 that
 even
 the
 apostles
 were
 amazed
 at
 His
 absorption
 and
 evident
 sadness
 they
 fell
 behind
 in
 amazement
 and
 fear
 Then
 He
 paused
 called
 the
 Twelve
 about
 Him
 and
 in
 language
 of
 absolute
 plainness
 without
 metaphor
 or
 simile
 He
 said
 Behold
 we
 go
 up
 to
 Jerusalem
 and
 all
 things
 that
 are
 written
 by
 the
 prophets
 concerning
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 shall
 be
 accomplished
 For
 he
 shall
 be
 delivered
 unto
 the
 Gentiles
 and
 shall
 be
 mocked
 and
 spitefully
 entreated
 and
 spitted
 on
 And
 they
 shall
 scourge
 him
 and
 put
 him
 to
 death
 and
 the
 third
 day
 he
 shall
 rise
 again
 It
 is
 to
 us
 an
 astounding
 fact
 that
 the
 Twelve
 failed
 to
 comprehend
 His
 meaning
 yet
 Luke
 unqualifiedly
 affirms
 And
 they
 understood
 none
 of
 these
 things
 and
 this
 saying
 was
 hid
 from
 them
 neither
 knew
 they
 the
 things
 which
 were
 spoken
 This
 avouchment
 of
 the
 Saviors
 approaching
 death
 and
 resurrection
 spoken
 in
 confidential
 certainty
 to
 the
 Twelve
 was
 the
 third
 of
 its
 kind
 and
 still
 they
 could
 not
 bring
 themselves
 to
 accept
 the
 awful
 truth
 According
 to
 Matthews
 account
 they
 were
 told
 of
 the
 very
 manner
 by
 which
 the
 Lord
 should
 diethat
 the
 Gentiles
 should
 crucify
 Him
 yet
 they
 understood
 not
 To
 them
 there
 was
 some
 dreadful
 incongruity
 some
 dire
 inconsistency
 or
 inexplicable
 contradiction
 in
 the
 sayings
 of
 their
 beloved
 Master
 They
 knew
 Him
 to
 be
 the
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 the
 living
 God
 and
 how
 could
 such
 a
 One
 be
 brought
 into
 subjection
 and
 be
 slain
 They
 could
 not
 fail
 to
 realize
 that
 some
 unprecedented
 development
 in
 His
 life
 was
 impending
 this
 they
 may
 have
 vaguely
 conceived
 to
 be
 the
 crisis
 for
 which
 they
 had
 been
 waiting
 the
 open
 proclamation
 of
 His
 Messianic
 dignity
 His
 enthronement
 as
 Lord
 and
 King
 And
 such
 indeed
 was
 to
 be
 though
 in
 a
 manner
 far
 different
 from
 their
 anticipations
 The
 culminating
 predictionthat
 on
 the
 third
 day
 He
 would
 rise
 againseems
 to
 have
 puzzled
 them
 the
 most
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 this
 assurance
 of
 ultimate
 triumph
 may
 have
 made
 all
 intermediate
 occurrences
 appear
 as
 of
 but
 secondary
 and
 transitory
 import
 They
 persistently
 repelled
 the
 thought
 that
 they
 were
 following
 their
 Lord
 to
 the
 cross
 and
 the
 sepulchre
 THE
 QUESTION
 OF
 PRECEDENCE
 AGAIN
 Notwithstanding
 all
 the
 instructions
 the
 apostles
 had
 received
 concerning
 humility
 and
 though
 they
 had
 before
 them
 the
 supreme
 example
 of
 the
 Masters
 life
 and
 conduct
 in
 which
 the
 fact
 that
 service
 was
 the
 only
 measure
 of
 true
 greatness
 was
 abundantly
 demonstrated
 they
 continued
 to
 dream
 of
 rank
 and
 honor
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 the
 Messiah
 Perhaps
 because
 of
 the
 imminence
 of
 the
 Masters
 triumph
 with
 which
 they
 all
 were
 particularly
 impressed
 at
 this
 time
 though
 ignorant
 of
 its
 real
 significance
 certain
 of
 the
 Twelve
 appealed
 to
 the
 Lord
 in
 the
 course
 of
 this
 journey
 with
 a
 most
 ambitious
 request
 The
 petitioners
 were
 James
 and
 John
 though
 according
 to
 Matthews
 record
 their
 mother
 was
 the
 first
 to
 ask
 The
 request
 was
 that
 when
 Jesus
 came
 into
 possession
 of
 His
 kingdom
 He
 would
 so
 signally
 honor
 the
 aspiring
 pair
 as
 to
 install
 them
 in
 seats
 of
 eminence
 one
 on
 His
 right
 hand
 the
 other
 on
 His
 left
 Instead
 of
 sharply
 rebuking
 such
 presumption
 Jesus
 gently
 but
 impressively
 asked
 Are
 ye
 able
 to
 drink
 of
 the
 cup
 that
 I
 shall
 drink
 of
 and
 to
 be
 baptized
 with
 the
 baptism
 that
 I
 am
 baptized
 with
 The
 answer
 was
 full
 of
 selfconfidence
 inspired
 by
 ignorant
 misapprehension
 We
 are
 able
 they
 replied
 Then
 said
 Jesus
 Ye
 shall
 drink
 indeed
 of
 my
 cup
 and
 be
 baptized
 with
 the
 baptism
 that
 I
 am
 baptized
 with
 but
 to
 sit
 on
 my
 right
 hand
 and
 on
 my
 left
 is
 not
 mine
 to
 give
 but
 it
 shall
 be
 given
 to
 them
 for
 whom
 it
 is
 prepared
 of
 my
 Father
 The
 ten
 apostles
 were
 indignant
 at
 the
 two
 brothers
 possibly
 less
 through
 disapproval
 of
 the
 spirit
 that
 had
 prompted
 the
 petition
 than
 because
 the
 two
 had
 forestalled
 the
 others
 in
 applying
 for
 the
 chief
 posts
 of
 distinction
 But
 Jesus
 patiently
 tolerant
 of
 their
 human
 weaknesses
 drew
 the
 Twelve
 around
 Him
 and
 taught
 them
 as
 a
 loving
 father
 might
 instruct
 and
 admonish
 his
 contentious
 children
 He
 showed
 them
 how
 earthly
 rulers
 such
 as
 princes
 among
 the
 Gentiles
 domineer
 over
 their
 subjects
 manifesting
 lordship
 and
 arbitrarily
 exercizing
 the
 authority
 of
 office
 But
 it
 was
 not
 to
 be
 so
 among
 the
 Masters
 servants
 whoever
 of
 them
 would
 be
 great
 must
 be
 a
 servant
 indeed
 willingly
 ministering
 unto
 his
 fellows
 the
 humblest
 and
 most
 willing
 servant
 would
 be
 the
 chief
 of
 the
 servants
 For
 even
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 came
 not
 to
 be
 ministered
 unto
 but
 to
 minister
 and
 to
 give
 his
 life
 a
 ransom
 for
 many
 SIGHT
 RESTORED
 TO
 THE
 BLIND
 NEAR
 JERICHO
 In
 the
 course
 of
 His
 journey
 Jesus
 came
 to
 Jericho
 at
 or
 near
 which
 city
 He
 again
 exerted
 His
 wondrous
 power
 in
 opening
 the
 eyes
 of
 the
 blind
 Matthew
 states
 that
 two
 sightless
 men
 were
 made
 to
 see
 and
 that
 the
 miracle
 was
 enacted
 as
 Jesus
 was
 leaving
 Jericho
 Mark
 mentions
 but
 one
 blind
 man
 whom
 he
 names
 Bartimeus
 or
 the
 son
 of
 Timeus
 and
 agrees
 with
 Matthew
 in
 saying
 that
 the
 healing
 was
 effected
 when
 Jesus
 was
 departing
 from
 the
 city
 Luke
 specifies
 but
 one
 subject
 of
 the
 Lords
 healing
 mercy
 a
 certain
 blind
 man
 and
 chronicles
 the
 miracle
 as
 an
 incident
 of
 Christs
 approach
 to
 Jericho
 These
 slight
 variations
 attest
 the
 independent
 authorship
 of
 each
 of
 the
 records
 and
 the
 apparent
 discrepancies
 have
 no
 direct
 bearing
 upon
 the
 main
 facts
 nor
 do
 they
 detract
 from
 the
 instructional
 value
 of
 the
 Lords
 work
 As
 we
 have
 found
 to
 be
 the
 case
 on
 an
 earlier
 occasion
 two
 men
 were
 mentioned
 though
 but
 one
 figures
 in
 the
 circumstantial
 accounts
 The
 man
 who
 is
 more
 particularly
 mentioned
 Bartimeus
 sat
 by
 the
 wayside
 asking
 alms
 Jesus
 approached
 accompanied
 by
 the
 apostles
 many
 other
 disciples
 and
 a
 great
 multitude
 of
 people
 probably
 made
 up
 largely
 of
 travelers
 on
 their
 way
 to
 Jerusalem
 to
 attend
 the
 Passover
 festival
 the
 time
 for
 which
 was
 about
 a
 week
 ahead
 Hearing
 the
 tramp
 of
 so
 great
 a
 company
 the
 sightless
 beggar
 inquired
 what
 it
 all
 meant
 and
 was
 answered
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 passeth
 by
 Eager
 lest
 the
 opportunity
 of
 gaining
 the
 Masters
 attention
 be
 lost
 he
 immediately
 cried
 in
 a
 loud
 voice
 Jesus
 thou
 son
 of
 David
 have
 mercy
 on
 me
 His
 appeal
 and
 particularly
 his
 use
 of
 the
 title
 Son
 of
 David
 show
 that
 he
 knew
 of
 the
 great
 Teacher
 had
 confidence
 in
 His
 power
 to
 heal
 and
 faith
 in
 Him
 as
 the
 promised
 King
 and
 Deliverer
 of
 Israel
 Those
 who
 were
 in
 advance
 of
 Jesus
 in
 the
 company
 tried
 to
 silence
 the
 man
 but
 the
 more
 they
 rebuked
 him
 the
 louder
 and
 more
 persistently
 did
 he
 cry
 Thou
 son
 of
 David
 have
 mercy
 on
 me
 Jesus
 halted
 in
 His
 course
 and
 directed
 that
 the
 man
 be
 brought
 to
 Him
 Those
 who
 but
 a
 moment
 before
 would
 have
 stopped
 the
 blind
 mans
 yearning
 appeal
 now
 that
 the
 Master
 had
 noticed
 him
 were
 eager
 to
 be
 of
 service
 To
 the
 sightless
 one
 they
 brought
 the
 glad
 word
 Be
 of
 good
 comfort
 rise
 he
 calleth
 thee
 and
 he
 casting
 aside
 his
 outer
 garment
 lest
 it
 hinder
 came
 in
 haste
 to
 Christ
 To
 the
 Lords
 question
 What
 wilt
 thou
 that
 I
 shall
 do
 unto
 thee
 Bartimeus
 answered
 Lord
 that
 I
 may
 receive
 my
 sight
 Then
 Jesus
 spake
 the
 simple
 words
 of
 power
 and
 blessing
 Receive
 thy
 sight
 thy
 faith
 hath
 saved
 thee
 The
 man
 full
 of
 gratitude
 and
 knowing
 that
 nothing
 short
 of
 divine
 interposition
 could
 have
 opened
 his
 eyes
 followed
 his
 Benefactor
 glorifying
 God
 in
 heartfelt
 prayers
 of
 thanksgiving
 in
 which
 many
 of
 those
 who
 had
 witnessed
 the
 miracle
 fervently
 joined
 ZACCHEUS
 THE
 CHIEF
 AMONG
 THE
 PUBLICANS
 Jericho
 was
 a
 city
 of
 considerable
 importance
 among
 its
 resident
 officials
 was
 a
 staff
 of
 publicans
 or
 collectors
 of
 customs
 and
 of
 these
 the
 chief
 was
 Zaccheus
 who
 had
 grown
 rich
 from
 the
 revenues
 of
 office
 He
 had
 doubtless
 heard
 of
 the
 great
 Galilean
 who
 hesitated
 not
 to
 mingle
 with
 publicans
 detested
 though
 they
 were
 by
 the
 Jews
 in
 general
 he
 may
 have
 known
 also
 that
 Jesus
 had
 placed
 one
 of
 this
 publican
 class
 among
 the
 most
 prominent
 of
 the
 disciples
 That
 Zaccheus
 was
 a
 Jew
 is
 indicated
 by
 his
 name
 which
 is
 a
 variant
 of
 Zacharias
 with
 a
 Greek
 or
 Latin
 termination
 he
 must
 have
 been
 particularly
 obnoxious
 to
 his
 people
 on
 account
 of
 his
 advanced
 status
 among
 the
 publicans
 all
 of
 whom
 were
 in
 Roman
 employ
 He
 had
 a
 great
 desire
 to
 see
 Jesus
 the
 feeling
 was
 not
 one
 of
 mere
 curiosity
 he
 had
 been
 impressed
 and
 set
 thinking
 by
 the
 things
 he
 had
 heard
 about
 this
 Teacher
 from
 Nazareth
 But
 Zaccheus
 was
 a
 little
 man
 and
 could
 not
 ordinarily
 see
 over
 the
 heads
 of
 others
 so
 he
 ran
 ahead
 of
 the
 company
 and
 climbed
 a
 tree
 alongside
 the
 road
 When
 Jesus
 reached
 the
 place
 to
 the
 great
 surprize
 of
 the
 man
 in
 the
 tree
 He
 looked
 up
 and
 said
 Zaccheus
 make
 haste
 and
 come
 down
 for
 to
 day
 I
 must
 abide
 at
 thy
 house
 Zaccheus
 came
 down
 with
 haste
 and
 joyfully
 received
 the
 Lord
 as
 his
 guest
 The
 multitude
 by
 whom
 Jesus
 had
 been
 accompanied
 appear
 to
 have
 been
 generally
 friendly
 toward
 Him
 but
 at
 this
 turn
 of
 affairs
 they
 murmured
 and
 criticized
 saying
 that
 the
 Master
 was
 gone
 to
 be
 guest
 with
 a
 man
 that
 is
 a
 sinner
 for
 all
 publicans
 were
 sinners
 in
 Jewish
 eyes
 and
 Zaccheus
 admitted
 that
 the
 opprobrium
 in
 his
 case
 was
 possibly
 deserved
 But
 having
 seen
 and
 conversed
 with
 Jesus
 this
 chief
 among
 the
 publicans
 believed
 and
 was
 converted
 As
 proof
 of
 his
 change
 of
 heart
 Zaccheus
 then
 and
 there
 voluntarily
 vowed
 unto
 the
 Lord
 to
 make
 amends
 and
 restitution
 if
 it
 were
 found
 that
 he
 owed
 such
 Behold
 Lord
 he
 said
 the
 half
 of
 my
 goods
 I
 give
 to
 the
 poor
 and
 if
 I
 have
 taken
 anything
 from
 any
 man
 by
 false
 accusation
 I
 restore
 him
 fourfold
 These
 were
 works
 meet
 for
 repentance
 The
 man
 realized
 that
 he
 could
 not
 change
 his
 past
 but
 he
 knew
 he
 could
 in
 part
 at
 least
 atone
 for
 some
 of
 his
 misdeeds
 His
 pledge
 to
 restore
 in
 fourfold
 measure
 whatever
 he
 had
 wrongfully
 acquired
 was
 in
 line
 with
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 as
 to
 restitution
 but
 far
 in
 excess
 of
 the
 recompense
 required
 Jesus
 accepted
 the
 mans
 profession
 of
 repentance
 and
 said
 This
 day
 is
 salvation
 come
 to
 this
 house
 forsomuch
 as
 he
 also
 is
 a
 son
 of
 Abraham
 Another
 stray
 sheep
 had
 been
 returned
 to
 the
 fold
 another
 lost
 treasure
 had
 been
 found
 another
 wayward
 son
 had
 come
 back
 to
 the
 Fathers
 house
 For
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 is
 come
 to
 seek
 and
 to
 save
 that
 which
 was
 lost
 UNTO
 EVERY
 ONE
 THAT
 HATH
 SHALL
 BE
 GIVEN
 As
 the
 multitude
 approached
 Jerusalem
 Jesus
 being
 in
 their
 midst
 expectation
 ran
 high
 as
 to
 what
 the
 Lord
 would
 do
 when
 He
 reached
 the
 capital
 of
 the
 nation
 Many
 of
 those
 with
 Him
 were
 looking
 for
 a
 proclamation
 of
 His
 royal
 authority
 and
 they
 thought
 that
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 should
 immediately
 appear
 Jesus
 told
 them
 a
 story
 we
 call
 it
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Pounds
 A
 certain
 nobleman
 went
 into
 a
 far
 country
 to
 receive
 for
 himself
 a
 kingdom
 and
 to
 return
 And
 he
 called
 his
 ten
 servants
 and
 delivered
 them
 ten
 pounds
 and
 said
 unto
 them
 Occupy
 till
 I
 come
 But
 his
 citizens
 hated
 him
 and
 sent
 a
 message
 after
 him
 saying
 We
 will
 not
 have
 this
 man
 to
 reign
 over
 us
 And
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 that
 when
 he
 was
 returned
 having
 received
 the
 kingdom
 then
 he
 commanded
 these
 servants
 to
 be
 called
 unto
 him
 to
 whom
 he
 had
 given
 the
 money
 that
 he
 might
 know
 how
 much
 every
 man
 had
 gained
 by
 trading
 Then
 came
 the
 first
 saying
 Lord
 thy
 pound
 hath
 gained
 ten
 pounds
 And
 he
 said
 unto
 him
 Well
 thou
 good
 servant
 because
 thou
 hast
 been
 faithful
 in
 a
 very
 little
 have
 thou
 authority
 over
 ten
 cities
 And
 the
 second
 came
 saying
 Lord
 thy
 pound
 hath
 gained
 five
 pounds
 And
 he
 said
 likewise
 to
 him
 Be
 thou
 also
 over
 five
 cities
 And
 another
 came
 saying
 Lord
 behold
 here
 is
 thy
 pound
 which
 I
 have
 kept
 laid
 up
 in
 a
 napkin
 For
 I
 feared
 thee
 because
 thou
 art
 an
 austere
 man
 thou
 takest
 up
 that
 thou
 layedst
 not
 down
 and
 reapest
 that
 thou
 didst
 not
 sow
 And
 he
 saith
 unto
 him
 Out
 of
 thine
 own
 mouth
 will
 I
 judge
 thee
 thou
 wicked
 servant
 Thou
 knewest
 that
 I
 was
 an
 austere
 man
 taking
 up
 that
 I
 laid
 not
 down
 and
 reaping
 that
 I
 did
 not
 sow
 Wherefore
 then
 gavest
 not
 thou
 my
 money
 into
 the
 bank
 that
 at
 my
 coming
 I
 might
 have
 required
 mine
 own
 with
 usury
 And
 he
 said
 unto
 them
 that
 stood
 by
 Take
 from
 him
 the
 pound
 and
 give
 it
 to
 him
 that
 hath
 ten
 pounds
 And
 they
 said
 unto
 him
 Lord
 he
 hath
 ten
 pounds
 For
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 unto
 every
 one
 which
 hath
 shall
 be
 given
 and
 from
 him
 that
 hath
 not
 even
 that
 he
 hath
 shall
 be
 taken
 away
 from
 him
 But
 those
 mine
 enemies
 which
 would
 not
 that
 I
 should
 reign
 over
 them
 bring
 hither
 and
 slay
 them
 before
 me
 Both
 the
 circumstances
 of
 the
 story
 and
 the
 application
 of
 the
 parable
 were
 more
 readily
 apparent
 to
 the
 Jewish
 multitude
 than
 they
 are
 to
 us
 The
 departure
 of
 a
 certain
 nobleman
 from
 a
 vassal
 province
 to
 the
 court
 of
 the
 suzerain
 to
 seek
 investiture
 of
 kingly
 authority
 and
 the
 protest
 of
 the
 citizens
 over
 whom
 he
 asserted
 the
 right
 to
 reign
 were
 incidents
 of
 Jewish
 history
 still
 fresh
 in
 the
 minds
 of
 the
 people
 to
 whom
 Christ
 spoke
 The
 explication
 of
 the
 parable
 is
 this
 The
 people
 were
 not
 to
 look
 for
 an
 immediate
 establishment
 of
 the
 kingdom
 in
 temporal
 power
 He
 who
 would
 be
 king
 was
 pictured
 as
 having
 departed
 for
 a
 far
 country
 from
 which
 he
 would
 assuredly
 return
 Before
 leaving
 he
 had
 given
 to
 each
 of
 his
 servants
 a
 definite
 sum
 of
 money
 and
 by
 their
 success
 in
 using
 this
 he
 would
 judge
 of
 their
 fitness
 to
 serve
 in
 offices
 of
 trust
 When
 he
 returned
 he
 called
 for
 an
 accounting
 in
 the
 course
 of
 which
 the
 cases
 of
 three
 servants
 are
 specified
 as
 types
 One
 had
 so
 used
 the
 pound
 as
 to
 gain
 ten
 pounds
 he
 was
 commended
 and
 received
 a
 reward
 such
 as
 only
 a
 sovereign
 could
 give
 the
 governorship
 of
 ten
 cities
 The
 second
 servant
 with
 equal
 capital
 had
 increased
 it
 only
 five
 fold
 he
 was
 properly
 rewarded
 in
 proportion
 by
 appointment
 as
 governor
 over
 five
 cities
 The
 third
 gave
 back
 what
 he
 had
 received
 without
 increase
 for
 he
 had
 failed
 to
 use
 it
 He
 had
 no
 reason
 and
 only
 a
 very
 poor
 excuse
 to
 offer
 for
 his
 dereliction
 In
 justice
 he
 was
 severely
 reprimanded
 and
 the
 money
 was
 taken
 from
 him
 When
 the
 king
 directed
 that
 the
 pound
 so
 forfeited
 by
 the
 unfaithful
 servant
 be
 given
 to
 him
 who
 already
 had
 ten
 some
 surprize
 was
 manifest
 amongst
 those
 who
 stood
 by
 but
 the
 king
 explained
 that
 unto
 every
 one
 that
 hath
 shall
 be
 given
 for
 such
 a
 one
 uses
 to
 advantage
 the
 means
 entrusted
 to
 his
 care
 while
 from
 him
 that
 hath
 not
 even
 that
 he
 hath
 shall
 be
 taken
 away
 from
 him
 for
 he
 has
 demonstrated
 his
 utter
 unfitness
 to
 possess
 and
 use
 aright
 This
 part
 of
 the
 parable
 while
 of
 general
 application
 must
 have
 appealed
 to
 the
 apostles
 as
 particularly
 apt
 for
 each
 of
 them
 had
 received
 in
 trust
 an
 equal
 endowment
 through
 ordination
 and
 each
 would
 be
 required
 to
 account
 for
 his
 administration
 The
 fact
 is
 apparent
 that
 Christ
 was
 the
 nobleman
 who
 was
 to
 be
 invested
 with
 the
 authority
 of
 kingship
 and
 who
 would
 return
 to
 require
 the
 accounting
 at
 the
 hands
 of
 His
 trusted
 servants
 But
 many
 of
 the
 citizens
 hated
 Him
 and
 would
 protest
 His
 investiture
 saying
 they
 would
 not
 have
 Him
 to
 reign
 over
 them
 When
 He
 does
 return
 in
 power
 and
 authority
 these
 rebellious
 citizens
 shall
 surely
 receive
 the
 punishment
 they
 deserve
 IN
 THE
 HOUSE
 OF
 SIMON
 THE
 LEPER
 Six
 days
 before
 the
 Feast
 of
 the
 Passover
 that
 is
 to
 say
 before
 the
 day
 on
 which
 the
 paschal
 lamb
 was
 to
 be
 eaten
 Jesus
 arrived
 at
 Bethany
 the
 home
 town
 of
 Martha
 and
 Mary
 and
 of
 Lazarus
 who
 had
 recently
 died
 and
 been
 restored
 to
 life
 The
 chronology
 of
 events
 during
 the
 last
 week
 of
 our
 Lords
 life
 supports
 the
 generally
 accepted
 belief
 that
 in
 this
 year
 the
 fourteenth
 day
 of
 Nisan
 on
 which
 the
 Passover
 festival
 began
 fell
 on
 Thursday
 and
 this
 being
 so
 the
 day
 on
 which
 Jesus
 reached
 Bethany
 was
 the
 preceding
 Friday
 the
 eve
 of
 the
 Jewish
 Sabbath
 Jesus
 fully
 realized
 that
 this
 Sabbath
 was
 the
 last
 He
 would
 live
 to
 see
 in
 mortality
 The
 Gospelwriters
 have
 drawn
 a
 veil
 of
 reverent
 silence
 over
 the
 events
 of
 that
 day
 It
 appears
 that
 Jesus
 passed
 His
 last
 Sabbath
 in
 retirement
 at
 Bethany
 The
 journey
 afoot
 from
 Jericho
 had
 been
 no
 easy
 walk
 for
 the
 road
 ascended
 to
 an
 altitude
 of
 nearly
 three
 thousand
 feet
 and
 was
 withal
 otherwise
 a
 toilsome
 way
 On
 Saturday
 probably
 in
 the
 evening
 after
 the
 Sabbath
 had
 passed
 a
 supper
 was
 spread
 for
 Jesus
 and
 the
 Twelve
 in
 the
 house
 of
 Simon
 the
 leper
 No
 other
 mention
 of
 this
 man
 Simon
 appears
 in
 scripture
 If
 he
 was
 living
 at
 the
 time
 our
 Lord
 was
 entertained
 in
 the
 house
 known
 by
 his
 name
 and
 if
 he
 was
 present
 he
 must
 have
 been
 previously
 healed
 of
 his
 leprosy
 as
 otherwise
 he
 could
 not
 have
 been
 allowed
 within
 the
 town
 far
 less
 to
 be
 one
 of
 a
 festal
 company
 It
 is
 reasonable
 to
 think
 that
 the
 man
 had
 once
 been
 a
 victim
 of
 leprosy
 and
 had
 come
 to
 be
 currently
 known
 as
 Simon
 the
 leper
 and
 that
 he
 was
 one
 among
 the
 many
 sufferers
 from
 this
 dread
 disease
 who
 had
 been
 healed
 through
 the
 Lords
 ministrations
 Martha
 was
 in
 charge
 of
 the
 supper
 arrangements
 on
 this
 memorable
 occasion
 and
 her
 sister
 Mary
 was
 with
 her
 while
 Lazarus
 sat
 at
 table
 with
 Jesus
 Many
 have
 assumed
 that
 the
 house
 of
 Simon
 the
 leper
 was
 the
 family
 home
 of
 the
 two
 sisters
 and
 Lazarus
 in
 which
 case
 it
 is
 possible
 that
 Simon
 was
 the
 father
 of
 the
 three
 but
 of
 such
 relationship
 we
 have
 no
 proof
 There
 was
 no
 attempt
 to
 secure
 unusual
 privacy
 at
 this
 supper
 Such
 occasions
 were
 customarily
 marked
 by
 the
 presence
 of
 many
 uninvited
 lookerson
 in
 that
 time
 and
 we
 are
 not
 surprized
 to
 learn
 therefore
 that
 many
 people
 were
 there
 and
 that
 they
 had
 come
 not
 for
 Jesus
 sake
 only
 but
 that
 they
 might
 see
 Lazarus
 also
 whom
 he
 had
 raised
 from
 the
 dead
 Lazarus
 was
 a
 subject
 of
 much
 interest
 and
 doubtless
 of
 curiosity
 among
 the
 people
 and
 at
 the
 time
 of
 his
 privileged
 and
 intimate
 association
 with
 Jesus
 in
 Bethany
 the
 chief
 priests
 were
 plotting
 to
 put
 him
 to
 death
 on
 account
 of
 the
 effect
 his
 restoration
 had
 had
 upon
 the
 people
 many
 of
 whom
 believed
 on
 Jesus
 because
 of
 the
 miracle
 That
 supper
 in
 Bethany
 was
 an
 event
 never
 to
 be
 forgotten
 Mary
 the
 more
 contemplative
 and
 spiritually
 minded
 of
 the
 two
 sisters
 she
 who
 loved
 to
 sit
 at
 the
 feet
 of
 Jesus
 and
 listen
 to
 His
 words
 and
 who
 had
 been
 commended
 for
 having
 so
 chosen
 the
 one
 needful
 thing
 which
 her
 more
 practical
 sister
 lacked
 brought
 from
 among
 her
 treasures
 an
 alabaster
 cruse
 containing
 a
 pound
 of
 costly
 spikenard
 ointment
 she
 broke
 the
 sealed
 flask
 and
 poured
 its
 fragrant
 contents
 upon
 the
 head
 and
 feet
 of
 her
 Lord
 and
 wiped
 His
 feet
 with
 her
 loosened
 tresses
 To
 anoint
 the
 head
 of
 a
 guest
 with
 ordinary
 oil
 was
 to
 do
 him
 honor
 to
 anoint
 his
 feet
 also
 was
 to
 show
 unusual
 and
 signal
 regard
 but
 the
 anointing
 of
 head
 and
 feet
 with
 spikenard
 and
 in
 such
 abundance
 was
 an
 act
 of
 reverential
 homage
 rarely
 rendered
 even
 to
 kings
 Marys
 act
 was
 an
 expression
 of
 adoration
 it
 was
 the
 fragrant
 outwelling
 of
 a
 heart
 overflowing
 with
 worship
 and
 affection
 But
 this
 splendid
 tribute
 of
 a
 devout
 womans
 love
 was
 made
 the
 cause
 of
 disagreeable
 protest
 Judas
 Iscariot
 treasurer
 of
 the
 Twelve
 but
 dishonest
 avaricious
 and
 smallsouled
 in
 character
 vented
 his
 grumbling
 complaint
 saying
 Why
 was
 not
 this
 ointment
 sold
 for
 three
 hundred
 pence
 and
 given
 to
 the
 poor
 His
 seeming
 solicitude
 for
 the
 poor
 was
 all
 hypocrisy
 He
 was
 a
 thief
 and
 lamented
 that
 he
 had
 not
 been
 given
 the
 precious
 ointment
 to
 sell
 or
 that
 the
 price
 had
 not
 been
 turned
 into
 the
 bag
 of
 which
 he
 was
 the
 selfinterested
 custodian
 Marys
 use
 of
 the
 costly
 unguent
 had
 been
 so
 lavish
 that
 others
 beside
 Judas
 had
 let
 their
 surprize
 grow
 into
 murmuring
 but
 to
 him
 is
 attributed
 the
 distinction
 of
 being
 the
 chief
 complainer
 Marys
 sensitive
 nature
 was
 pained
 by
 the
 ungracious
 words
 of
 disapproval
 but
 Jesus
 interposed
 saying
 Why
 trouble
 ye
 the
 woman
 for
 she
 hath
 wrought
 a
 good
 work
 upon
 me
 Then
 in
 further
 rebuke
 and
 by
 way
 of
 solemn
 instruction
 He
 continued
 For
 ye
 have
 the
 poor
 always
 with
 you
 but
 me
 ye
 have
 not
 always
 For
 in
 that
 she
 hath
 poured
 this
 ointment
 on
 my
 body
 she
 did
 it
 for
 my
 burial
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Wheresoever
 this
 gospel
 shall
 be
 preached
 in
 the
 whole
 world
 there
 shall
 also
 this
 that
 this
 woman
 hath
 done
 be
 told
 for
 a
 memorial
 of
 her
 We
 are
 left
 without
 certain
 information
 as
 to
 whether
 Mary
 knew
 that
 within
 a
 few
 days
 her
 beloved
 Lord
 would
 be
 in
 the
 tomb
 She
 may
 have
 been
 so
 informed
 in
 view
 of
 the
 hallowed
 intimacy
 between
 Jesus
 and
 the
 family
 or
 she
 may
 have
 gathered
 from
 the
 remarks
 of
 Christ
 to
 the
 apostles
 that
 the
 sacrifice
 of
 His
 life
 was
 impending
 or
 perhaps
 by
 inspired
 intuition
 she
 was
 impelled
 to
 render
 the
 loving
 tribute
 by
 which
 her
 memory
 has
 been
 enshrined
 in
 the
 hearts
 of
 all
 who
 know
 and
 love
 the
 Christ
 John
 has
 preserved
 to
 us
 this
 remark
 of
 Jesus
 in
 the
 rebuke
 called
 forth
 by
 the
 grumbling
 Iscariot
 Let
 her
 alone
 against
 the
 day
 of
 my
 burying
 hath
 she
 kept
 this
 and
 Marks
 version
 is
 likewise
 suggestive
 of
 definite
 and
 solemn
 purpose
 on
 Marys
 part
 She
 is
 come
 aforehand
 to
 anoint
 my
 body
 to
 the
 burying
 CHRISTS
 TRIUMPHAL
 ENTRY
 INTO
 JERUSALEM
 While
 still
 in
 Bethany
 or
 in
 the
 neighboring
 village
 of
 Bethphage
 and
 according
 to
 Johns
 account
 on
 the
 next
 day
 after
 the
 supper
 at
 Simons
 house
 Jesus
 directed
 two
 of
 His
 disciples
 to
 go
 to
 a
 certain
 place
 where
 He
 told
 them
 they
 would
 find
 an
 ass
 tied
 and
 with
 her
 a
 colt
 on
 which
 no
 man
 had
 ever
 sat
 These
 they
 were
 to
 bring
 to
 Him
 If
 stopped
 or
 questioned
 they
 were
 to
 say
 the
 Lord
 had
 need
 of
 the
 animals
 Matthew
 alone
 mentions
 both
 ass
 and
 colt
 the
 other
 writers
 specify
 the
 latter
 only
 most
 likely
 the
 mother
 followed
 as
 the
 foal
 was
 led
 away
 and
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 dam
 probably
 served
 to
 keep
 the
 colt
 tractable
 The
 disciples
 found
 all
 to
 be
 as
 the
 Lord
 had
 said
 They
 brought
 the
 colt
 to
 Jesus
 spread
 their
 coats
 on
 the
 gentle
 creatures
 back
 and
 set
 the
 Master
 thereon
 The
 company
 started
 toward
 Jerusalem
 Jesus
 riding
 in
 their
 midst
 Now
 as
 was
 usual
 great
 numbers
 of
 people
 had
 come
 up
 to
 the
 city
 many
 days
 before
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 Passover
 rites
 in
 order
 that
 they
 might
 attend
 to
 matters
 of
 personal
 purification
 and
 make
 good
 their
 arrears
 in
 the
 offering
 of
 prescribed
 sacrifices
 Though
 the
 great
 day
 on
 which
 the
 festival
 was
 to
 be
 inaugurated
 was
 yet
 four
 days
 ahead
 the
 city
 was
 thronged
 with
 pilgrim
 crowds
 and
 among
 these
 much
 questioning
 had
 arisen
 as
 to
 whether
 Jesus
 would
 venture
 to
 appear
 publicly
 in
 Jerusalem
 during
 the
 feast
 in
 view
 of
 the
 wellknown
 plans
 of
 the
 hierarchy
 to
 take
 Him
 into
 custody
 The
 common
 people
 were
 interested
 in
 every
 act
 and
 movement
 of
 the
 Master
 and
 word
 of
 His
 departure
 from
 Bethany
 sped
 ahead
 of
 Him
 so
 that
 by
 the
 time
 He
 began
 the
 descent
 from
 the
 highest
 part
 of
 the
 road
 on
 the
 flank
 of
 the
 Mount
 of
 Olives
 great
 crowds
 had
 gathered
 about
 Him
 The
 people
 were
 jubilant
 over
 the
 spectacle
 of
 Jesus
 riding
 toward
 the
 holy
 city
 they
 spread
 out
 their
 garments
 and
 cast
 palm
 fronds
 and
 other
 foliage
 in
 His
 path
 thus
 carpeting
 the
 way
 as
 for
 the
 passing
 of
 a
 king
 For
 the
 time
 being
 He
 was
 their
 king
 and
 they
 His
 adoring
 subjects
 The
 voices
 of
 the
 multitude
 sounded
 in
 reverberating
 harmony
 Blessed
 be
 the
 King
 that
 cometh
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Lord
 peace
 in
 heaven
 and
 glory
 in
 the
 highest
 and
 again
 Hosanna
 to
 the
 son
 of
 David
 Blessed
 is
 he
 that
 cometh
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Lord
 Hosanna
 in
 the
 highest
 But
 amidst
 all
 this
 jubilation
 Jesus
 was
 sad
 as
 He
 came
 in
 sight
 of
 the
 great
 city
 wherein
 stood
 the
 House
 of
 the
 Lord
 and
 He
 wept
 because
 of
 the
 wickedness
 of
 His
 people
 and
 of
 their
 refusal
 to
 accept
 Him
 as
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 moreover
 He
 foresaw
 the
 awful
 scenes
 of
 destruction
 before
 which
 both
 city
 and
 temple
 were
 soon
 to
 fall
 In
 anguish
 and
 tears
 He
 thus
 apostrophized
 the
 doomed
 city
 If
 thou
 hadst
 known
 even
 thou
 at
 least
 in
 this
 thy
 day
 the
 things
 which
 belong
 unto
 thy
 peace
 but
 now
 they
 are
 hid
 from
 thine
 eyes
 For
 the
 days
 shall
 come
 upon
 thee
 that
 thine
 enemies
 shall
 cast
 a
 trench
 about
 thee
 and
 compass
 thee
 round
 and
 keep
 thee
 in
 on
 every
 side
 And
 shall
 lay
 thee
 even
 with
 the
 ground
 and
 thy
 children
 within
 thee
 and
 they
 shall
 not
 leave
 in
 thee
 one
 stone
 upon
 another
 because
 thou
 knewest
 not
 the
 time
 of
 thy
 visitation
 The
 multitude
 was
 increased
 by
 tributary
 crowds
 who
 fell
 in
 with
 the
 imposing
 procession
 at
 every
 crossway
 and
 the
 shouts
 of
 praise
 and
 homage
 were
 heard
 inside
 the
 city
 while
 the
 advancing
 company
 was
 yet
 far
 from
 the
 walls
 When
 the
 Lord
 rode
 through
 the
 massive
 portal
 and
 actually
 entered
 the
 capital
 of
 the
 Great
 King
 the
 whole
 city
 was
 thrilled
 To
 the
 inquiry
 of
 the
 uninformed
 Who
 is
 this
 the
 multitude
 shouted
 This
 is
 Jesus
 the
 prophet
 of
 Nazareth
 of
 Galilee
 It
 may
 be
 that
 the
 Galilean
 pilgrims
 were
 first
 to
 answer
 and
 loudest
 in
 the
 gladsome
 proclamation
 for
 the
 proud
 Judeans
 held
 Galilee
 in
 low
 esteem
 and
 on
 this
 day
 Jesus
 of
 Galilee
 was
 the
 most
 prominent
 personage
 in
 Jerusalem
 The
 Pharisees
 resentful
 of
 the
 honors
 thus
 shown
 to
 One
 whom
 they
 had
 long
 plotted
 to
 destroy
 impotently
 condoled
 with
 one
 another
 over
 the
 failure
 of
 all
 their
 nefarious
 schemes
 saying
 Perceive
 ye
 how
 ye
 prevail
 nothing
 behold
 the
 world
 is
 gone
 after
 him
 Unable
 to
 check
 the
 surging
 enthusiasm
 of
 the
 multitudes
 or
 to
 silence
 the
 joyous
 acclamations
 some
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 made
 their
 way
 through
 the
 throngs
 until
 they
 reached
 Jesus
 and
 to
 Him
 they
 appealed
 saying
 Master
 rebuke
 thy
 disciples
 But
 the
 Lord
 answered
 and
 said
 unto
 them
 I
 tell
 you
 that
 if
 these
 should
 hold
 their
 peace
 the
 stones
 would
 immediately
 cry
 out
 Dismounting
 He
 entered
 afoot
 the
 temple
 enclosure
 shouts
 of
 adulation
 greeted
 Him
 there
 Chief
 priests
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 the
 official
 representatives
 of
 the
 theocracy
 the
 hierarchy
 of
 Judaism
 were
 incensed
 there
 was
 no
 denying
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 people
 were
 rendering
 Messianic
 honors
 to
 this
 troublesome
 Nazarene
 and
 that
 too
 within
 the
 very
 purlieus
 of
 the
 temple
 of
 Jehovah
 The
 purpose
 of
 Christ
 in
 thus
 yielding
 Himself
 for
 the
 day
 to
 the
 desires
 of
 the
 people
 and
 accepting
 their
 homage
 with
 kingly
 grace
 may
 not
 be
 fully
 comprehended
 by
 us
 of
 finite
 mind
 That
 the
 occasion
 was
 no
 accidental
 or
 fortuitous
 happening
 of
 which
 He
 took
 advantage
 without
 preconceived
 intention
 is
 evident
 He
 knew
 beforehand
 what
 would
 be
 and
 what
 He
 would
 do
 It
 was
 no
 meaningless
 pageantry
 but
 the
 actual
 advent
 of
 the
 King
 into
 His
 royal
 city
 and
 His
 entry
 into
 the
 temple
 the
 house
 of
 the
 King
 of
 kings
 He
 came
 riding
 on
 an
 ass
 in
 token
 of
 peace
 acclaimed
 by
 the
 Hosanna
 shouts
 of
 multitudes
 not
 on
 a
 caparisoned
 steed
 with
 the
 panoply
 of
 combat
 and
 the
 accompaniment
 of
 bugle
 blasts
 and
 fanfare
 of
 trumpets
 That
 the
 joyous
 occasion
 was
 in
 no
 sense
 suggestive
 of
 physical
 hostility
 or
 of
 seditious
 disturbance
 is
 sufficiently
 demonstrated
 by
 the
 indulgent
 unconcern
 with
 which
 it
 was
 viewed
 by
 the
 Roman
 officials
 who
 were
 usually
 prompt
 to
 send
 their
 legionaries
 swooping
 down
 from
 the
 fortress
 of
 Antonia
 at
 the
 first
 evidence
 of
 an
 outbreak
 and
 they
 were
 particularly
 vigilant
 in
 suppressing
 all
 Messianic
 pretenders
 for
 false
 Messiahs
 had
 arisen
 already
 and
 much
 blood
 had
 been
 shed
 in
 the
 forcible
 dispelling
 of
 their
 delusive
 claims
 But
 the
 Romans
 saw
 nothing
 to
 fear
 perhaps
 much
 to
 smile
 at
 in
 the
 spectacle
 of
 a
 King
 mounted
 upon
 an
 ass
 and
 attended
 by
 subjects
 who
 though
 numerous
 brandished
 no
 weapons
 but
 waved
 instead
 palm
 branches
 and
 myrtle
 sprigs
 The
 ass
 has
 been
 designated
 in
 literature
 as
 the
 ancient
 symbol
 of
 Jewish
 royalty
 and
 one
 riding
 upon
 an
 ass
 as
 the
 type
 of
 peaceful
 progress
 Such
 triumphal
 entry
 of
 Jesus
 into
 the
 chief
 city
 of
 the
 Jews
 would
 have
 been
 strikingly
 inconsistent
 with
 the
 general
 tenor
 of
 His
 ministry
 in
 its
 early
 stages
 Even
 the
 intimation
 that
 He
 was
 the
 Christ
 had
 been
 made
 with
 guarded
 care
 if
 at
 all
 and
 every
 manifestation
 of
 popular
 regard
 in
 which
 He
 might
 have
 figured
 as
 a
 national
 leader
 had
 been
 suppressed
 Now
 however
 the
 hour
 of
 the
 great
 consummation
 was
 near
 at
 hand
 the
 public
 acceptance
 of
 the
 nations
 homage
 and
 the
 acknowledgment
 of
 both
 kingly
 and
 Messianic
 titles
 constituted
 an
 open
 and
 official
 proclamation
 of
 His
 divine
 investiture
 He
 had
 entered
 city
 and
 temple
 in
 such
 royal
 state
 as
 befitted
 the
 Prince
 of
 Peace
 By
 the
 rulers
 of
 the
 nation
 He
 had
 been
 rejected
 and
 His
 claims
 derided
 The
 manner
 of
 His
 entry
 should
 have
 appealed
 to
 the
 learned
 teachers
 of
 the
 law
 and
 the
 prophets
 for
 Zechariahs
 impressive
 forecast
 the
 fulfilment
 of
 which
 the
 evangelist
 John
 finds
 in
 the
 events
 of
 this
 memorable
 Sunday
 was
 frequently
 cited
 among
 them
 Rejoice
 greatly
 O
 daughter
 of
 Zion
 shout
 O
 daughter
 of
 Jerusalem
 behold
 thy
 King
 cometh
 unto
 thee
 he
 is
 just
 and
 having
 salvation

 CERTAIN
 GREEKS
 VISIT
 CHRIST
 Among
 the
 multitudes
 who
 came
 to
 Jerusalem
 at
 the
 time
 of
 the
 annual
 Passover
 were
 people
 of
 many
 nations
 Some
 of
 these
 though
 not
 of
 Jewish
 descent
 had
 been
 converted
 to
 Judaism
 they
 were
 admitted
 to
 the
 temple
 precincts
 but
 were
 not
 allowed
 to
 pass
 beyond
 the
 court
 of
 the
 Gentiles
 Sometime
 during
 our
 Lords
 last
 week
 of
 mortal
 life
 possibly
 on
 the
 day
 of
 His
 royal
 entry
 into
 the
 city
 certain
 Greeks
 who
 were
 evidently
 numbered
 among
 the
 proselytes
 since
 they
 had
 come
 to
 worship
 at
 the
 feast
 sought
 an
 interview
 with
 Jesus
 Imbued
 with
 a
 becoming
 sense
 of
 decorum
 they
 hesitated
 to
 directly
 approach
 the
 Master
 and
 applied
 instead
 to
 Philip
 one
 of
 the
 apostles
 saying
 Sir
 we
 would
 see
 Jesus
 Philip
 consulted
 with
 Andrew
 and
 the
 two
 then
 informed
 Jesus
 who
 as
 we
 may
 reasonably
 infer
 from
 the
 context
 though
 the
 fact
 is
 not
 explicitly
 stated
 graciously
 received
 the
 foreign
 visitors
 and
 imparted
 to
 them
 precepts
 of
 the
 utmost
 worth
 It
 is
 evident
 that
 the
 desire
 of
 these
 Greeks
 to
 meet
 the
 Master
 was
 not
 grounded
 on
 curiosity
 or
 other
 unworthy
 impulse
 they
 earnestly
 wished
 to
 see
 and
 hear
 the
 Teacher
 whose
 fame
 had
 reached
 their
 country
 and
 whose
 doctrines
 had
 impressed
 them
 To
 them
 Jesus
 testified
 that
 the
 hour
 of
 His
 death
 was
 near
 at
 hand
 the
 hour
 in
 which
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 should
 be
 glorified
 They
 were
 surprized
 and
 pained
 by
 the
 Lords
 words
 and
 possibly
 they
 inquired
 as
 to
 the
 necessity
 of
 such
 a
 sacrifice
 Jesus
 explained
 by
 citing
 a
 striking
 illustration
 drawn
 from
 nature
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Except
 a
 corn
 of
 wheat
 fall
 into
 the
 ground
 and
 die
 it
 abideth
 alone
 but
 if
 it
 die
 it
 bringeth
 forth
 much
 fruit
 The
 simile
 is
 an
 apt
 oneand
 at
 once
 impressively
 simple
 and
 beautiful
 A
 farmer
 who
 neglects
 or
 refuses
 to
 cast
 his
 wheat
 into
 the
 earth
 because
 he
 wants
 to
 keep
 it
 can
 have
 no
 increase
 but
 if
 he
 sow
 the
 wheat
 in
 good
 rich
 soil
 each
 living
 grain
 may
 multiply
 itself
 many
 fold
 though
 of
 necessity
 the
 seed
 must
 be
 sacrificed
 in
 the
 process
 So
 said
 the
 Lord
 He
 that
 loveth
 his
 life
 shall
 lose
 it
 and
 he
 that
 hateth
 his
 life
 in
 this
 world
 shall
 keep
 it
 unto
 life
 eternal
 The
 Masters
 meaning
 is
 clear
 he
 that
 loves
 his
 life
 so
 well
 that
 he
 will
 not
 imperil
 it
 or
 if
 need
 be
 give
 it
 up
 in
 the
 service
 of
 God
 shall
 forfeit
 his
 opportunity
 to
 win
 the
 bounteous
 increase
 of
 eternal
 life
 while
 he
 who
 esteems
 the
 call
 of
 God
 as
 so
 greatly
 superior
 to
 life
 that
 his
 love
 of
 life
 is
 as
 hatred
 in
 comparison
 shall
 find
 the
 life
 he
 freely
 yields
 or
 is
 willing
 to
 yield
 though
 for
 the
 time
 being
 it
 disappear
 like
 the
 grain
 buried
 in
 the
 soil
 and
 he
 shall
 rejoice
 in
 the
 bounty
 of
 eternal
 development
 If
 such
 be
 true
 of
 every
 mans
 existence
 how
 transcendently
 so
 was
 it
 of
 the
 life
 of
 Him
 who
 came
 to
 die
 that
 men
 may
 live
 Therefore
 was
 it
 necessary
 that
 He
 die
 as
 He
 had
 said
 He
 was
 about
 to
 do
 but
 His
 death
 far
 from
 being
 life
 lost
 was
 to
 be
 life
 glorified
 VOICE
 FROM
 HEAVEN
 The
 realization
 of
 the
 harrowing
 experiences
 upon
 which
 He
 was
 about
 to
 enter
 and
 particularly
 the
 contemplation
 of
 the
 state
 of
 sin
 which
 made
 His
 sacrifice
 imperative
 so
 weighed
 upon
 the
 Saviors
 mind
 that
 He
 sorrowed
 deeply
 Now
 is
 my
 soul
 troubled
 He
 groaned
 and
 what
 shall
 I
 say
 He
 exclaimed
 in
 anguish
 Should
 He
 say
 Father
 save
 me
 from
 this
 hour
 when
 as
 He
 knew
 for
 this
 cause
 had
 He
 come
 unto
 this
 hour
 To
 His
 Father
 alone
 could
 He
 turn
 for
 comforting
 support
 not
 to
 ask
 relief
 from
 but
 strength
 to
 endure
 what
 was
 to
 come
 and
 He
 prayed
 Father
 glorify
 thy
 name
 It
 was
 the
 rising
 of
 a
 mighty
 Soul
 to
 meet
 a
 supreme
 issue
 which
 for
 the
 moment
 had
 seemed
 to
 be
 overwhelming
 To
 that
 prayer
 of
 renewed
 surrender
 to
 the
 Fathers
 will
 Then
 came
 there
 a
 voice
 from
 heaven
 saying
 I
 have
 both
 glorified
 it
 and
 will
 glorify
 it
 again
 The
 voice
 was
 real
 it
 was
 no
 subjective
 whisper
 of
 comfort
 to
 the
 inner
 consciousness
 of
 Jesus
 but
 an
 external
 objective
 reality
 People
 who
 were
 standing
 by
 heard
 the
 sound
 and
 interpreted
 it
 variously
 some
 said
 it
 was
 thunder
 others
 of
 better
 spiritual
 discernment
 said
 An
 angel
 spake
 to
 him
 and
 some
 may
 have
 understood
 the
 words
 as
 had
 Jesus
 Now
 fully
 emerged
 from
 the
 passing
 cloud
 of
 enveloping
 anguish
 the
 Lord
 turned
 to
 the
 people
 saying
 This
 voice
 came
 not
 because
 of
 me
 but
 for
 your
 sakes
 And
 then
 with
 the
 consciousness
 of
 assured
 triumph
 over
 sin
 and
 death
 He
 exclaimed
 in
 accents
 of
 divine
 jubilation
 as
 though
 the
 cross
 and
 the
 sepulchre
 were
 already
 of
 the
 past
 Now
 is
 the
 judgment
 of
 this
 world
 now
 shall
 the
 prince
 of
 this
 world
 be
 cast
 out
 Satan
 the
 prince
 of
 the
 world
 was
 doomed
 And
 I
 the
 Lord
 continued
 if
 I
 be
 lifted
 up
 from
 the
 earth
 will
 draw
 all
 men
 unto
 me
 John
 assures
 us
 that
 this
 last
 utterance
 signified
 the
 manner
 of
 the
 Lords
 death
 the
 people
 so
 understood
 and
 they
 asked
 an
 explanation
 of
 what
 seemed
 to
 them
 an
 inconsistency
 in
 that
 the
 scriptures
 as
 they
 had
 been
 taught
 to
 interpret
 the
 same
 declared
 that
 the
 Christ
 was
 to
 abide
 forever
 and
 now
 He
 who
 claimed
 to
 be
 the
 Messiah
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 averred
 that
 He
 must
 be
 lifted
 up
 Who
 is
 this
 Son
 of
 man
 they
 asked
 Mindful
 as
 ever
 not
 to
 cast
 pearls
 where
 they
 would
 not
 be
 appreciated
 the
 Lord
 refrained
 from
 a
 direct
 avowal
 but
 admonished
 them
 to
 walk
 in
 the
 light
 while
 the
 light
 was
 with
 them
 for
 darkness
 would
 surely
 follow
 and
 as
 He
 reminded
 them
 he
 that
 walketh
 in
 darkness
 knoweth
 not
 whither
 he
 goeth
 In
 conclusion
 the
 Lord
 admonished
 them
 thus
 While
 ye
 have
 light
 believe
 in
 the
 light
 that
 ye
 may
 be
 the
 children
 of
 light
 At
 the
 close
 of
 this
 discourse
 Jesus
 departed
 from
 the
 people
 and
 did
 hide
 himself
 from
 them
 The
 record
 of
 the
 first
 day
 of
 what
 has
 come
 to
 be
 known
 as
 the
 week
 of
 our
 Lords
 passion
 is
 thus
 concluded
 by
 Mark
 And
 when
 he
 had
 looked
 round
 about
 upon
 all
 things
 and
 now
 the
 eventide
 was
 come
 he
 went
 out
 unto
 Bethany

 NOTES

 CHAPTER
 
 
 The
 Mother
 of
 James
 and
 JohnThe
 mother
 of
 these
 two
 sons
 of
 Zebedee
 Matt
 
 compare
 
 is
 generally
 understood
 to
 have
 been
 the
 Salome
 mentioned
 as
 one
 of
 the
 women
 present
 at
 the
 crucifixion
 Mark
 
 compare
 Matt
 
 in
 which
 the
 mother
 of
 Zebedees
 children
 is
 mentioned
 and
 the
 name
 Salome
 is
 omitted
 and
 one
 of
 those
 who
 arrived
 first
 at
 the
 tomb
 on
 the
 morning
 of
 the
 resurrection
 Mark
 
 From
 the
 fact
 that
 John
 mentions
 the
 mother
 of
 Jesus
 and
 his
 mothers
 sister
 
 and
 omits
 mention
 of
 Salome
 by
 name
 some
 expositors
 hold
 that
 Salome
 was
 the
 sister
 of
 Mary
 the
 mother
 of
 Jesus
 and
 therefore
 the
 Saviors
 aunt
 This
 relationship
 would
 make
 James
 and
 John
 cousins
 to
 Jesus
 While
 the
 scriptural
 record
 does
 not
 disprove
 this
 alleged
 kinship
 it
 certainly
 does
 not
 affirm
 the
 same
 
 JerichoThis
 was
 an
 ancient
 city
 lying
 northeasterly
 from
 Jerusalem
 a
 little
 less
 than
 fifteen
 miles
 in
 a
 straight
 line
 In
 the
 course
 of
 the
 exodus
 it
 was
 captured
 by
 the
 people
 of
 Israel
 through
 a
 miraculous
 interposition
 of
 divine
 power
 Josh
 
 The
 productiveness
 of
 the
 region
 is
 indicated
 by
 the
 descriptive
 appellation
 city
 of
 palm
 trees
 Deut
 
 Judg
 
 
 
 Chron
 
 The
 name
 Jericho
 means
 place
 of
 fragrance
 Its
 climate
 was
 semitropical
 a
 consequence
 of
 its
 low
 altitude
 It
 lay
 in
 a
 valley
 several
 hundred
 feet
 below
 the
 level
 of
 the
 Mediterranean
 this
 explains
 Lukes
 statement
 
 that
 after
 Jesus
 had
 spoken
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Pounds
 when
 on
 the
 way
 from
 Jericho
 he
 went
 before
 ascending
 up
 to
 Jerusalem
 In
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 Jericho
 was
 an
 important
 city
 and
 the
 abundance
 of
 its
 commercial
 products
 particularly
 balsam
 and
 spices
 led
 to
 the
 maintenance
 of
 a
 customs
 office
 there
 over
 which
 Zaccheus
 seems
 to
 have
 presided
 
 The
 Nobleman
 and
 the
 KingdomThe
 local
 setting
 of
 the
 part
 of
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Pounds
 that
 relates
 to
 a
 certain
 nobleman
 going
 into
 a
 far
 country
 to
 receive
 for
 himself
 a
 kingdom
 had
 its
 parallel
 in
 history
 Archelaus
 who
 by
 the
 will
 of
 his
 father
 Herod
 the
 Great
 had
 been
 named
 king
 of
 the
 Jews
 set
 out
 for
 Rome
 to
 ask
 of
 the
 emperor
 the
 confirmation
 of
 his
 royal
 status
 He
 was
 opposed
 by
 a
 protest
 from
 the
 people
 On
 the
 utilization
 of
 this
 circumstance
 in
 the
 parable
 Farrar
 p
 
 note
 says
 A
 nobleman
 going
 into
 a
 far
 country
 to
 receive
 a
 kingdom
 would
 be
 utterly
 unintelligible
 had
 we
 not
 fortunately
 known
 that
 this
 was
 done
 both
 by
 Archelaus
 and
 by
 Antipas
 Jos
 Ant
 xvii
 
 And
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Archelaus
 the
 Jews
 had
 actually
 sent
 to
 Augustus
 a
 deputation
 of
 fifty
 to
 recount
 his
 cruelties
 and
 oppose
 his
 claims
 which
 though
 it
 failed
 at
 the
 time
 was
 subsequently
 successful
 Josephus
 Ant
 xvii
 
 Philipus
 defended
 the
 property
 of
 Archelaus
 during
 his
 absence
 from
 the
 encroachments
 of
 the
 Proconsul
 Sabinus
 The
 magnificent
 palace
 which
 Archelaus
 had
 built
 at
 Jericho
 Jos
 Ant
 xvii
 
 would
 naturally
 recall
 these
 circumstances
 to
 the
 mind
 of
 Jesus
 and
 the
 parable
 is
 another
 striking
 example
 of
 the
 manner
 in
 which
 He
 utilized
 the
 most
 ordinary
 circumstances
 around
 Him
 and
 made
 them
 the
 bases
 of
 His
 highest
 teachings
 It
 is
 also
 another
 unsuspected
 indication
 of
 the
 authenticity
 and
 truthfulness
 of
 the
 Gospels
 
 We
 Will
 Not
 Have
 this
 Man
 to
 Reign
 Over
 UsOn
 this
 phase
 of
 the
 parable
 Trench
 Miracles
 p
 
 very
 aptly
 remarks
 Twice
 before
 He
 had
 gone
 to
 receive
 His
 kingdom
 this
 very
 declaration
 found
 formal
 utterance
 from
 their
 lipsonce
 when
 they
 cried
 to
 Pilate
 We
 have
 no
 king
 but
 Csar
 and
 again
 when
 they
 remonstrated
 with
 him
 Write
 not
 The
 King
 of
 the
 Jews
 John
 
 
 compare
 Acts
 
 But
 the
 stricter
 fulfilment
 of
 these
 words
 is
 to
 be
 found
 in
 the
 demeanor
 of
 the
 Jews
 after
 His
 ascension
 their
 fierce
 hostility
 to
 Christ
 in
 His
 infant
 Church

 The
 Day
 of
 the
 Supper
 at
 BethanyJohn
 places
 this
 event
 as
 having
 occurred
 on
 the
 day
 following
 Christs
 arrival
 in
 Bethany
 for
 as
 we
 see
 from
 
 the
 triumphal
 entry
 into
 Jerusalem
 took
 place
 on
 the
 next
 day
 after
 the
 supper
 and
 as
 stated
 in
 the
 text
 Jesus
 most
 probably
 reached
 Bethany
 on
 Friday
 The
 joyous
 processional
 into
 Jerusalem
 did
 not
 occur
 on
 the
 day
 following
 Friday
 for
 that
 was
 the
 Jewish
 Sabbath
 Matthew
 
 and
 Mark
 
 give
 place
 to
 the
 incident
 of
 the
 supper
 after
 the
 record
 of
 the
 triumphal
 entry
 and
 other
 events
 from
 which
 some
 have
 drawn
 the
 inference
 that
 these
 two
 writers
 place
 the
 supper
 two
 days
 before
 the
 Passover
 This
 inference
 lacks
 confirmation
 In
 this
 matter
 the
 chronological
 order
 given
 by
 John
 appears
 to
 be
 the
 true
 one
 
 The
 Family
 Home
 at
 BethanyThe
 home
 of
 Martha
 Mary
 and
 Lazarus
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 the
 usual
 abiding
 place
 of
 Jesus
 when
 He
 was
 in
 Bethany
 Undoubtedly
 He
 was
 on
 terms
 of
 very
 close
 and
 affectionate
 acquaintanceship
 with
 all
 members
 of
 the
 family
 even
 before
 the
 miraculous
 raising
 of
 Lazarus
 from
 the
 dead
 and
 this
 supremely
 blessed
 occurrence
 must
 have
 intensified
 into
 worshipful
 reverence
 the
 esteem
 in
 which
 our
 Lord
 had
 been
 held
 in
 that
 household
 As
 to
 whether
 this
 home
 was
 identical
 with
 the
 house
 of
 Simon
 the
 leper
 the
 scriptural
 record
 does
 not
 state
 John
 who
 gives
 a
 fairly
 detailed
 account
 of
 the
 supper
 served
 by
 Martha
 makes
 no
 mention
 of
 Simon
 or
 his
 house
 It
 is
 noticeable
 that
 the
 synoptic
 writers
 say
 very
 little
 about
 this
 home
 in
 Bethany
 Farrar
 has
 aptly
 remarked
 p
 
 We
 seem
 to
 trace
 in
 the
 Synoptists
 a
 special
 reticence
 about
 the
 family
 at
 Bethany
 The
 house
 in
 which
 they
 take
 a
 prominent
 position
 is
 called
 the
 house
 of
 Simon
 the
 leper
 Mary
 is
 called
 simply
 a
 woman
 by
 St
 Matthew
 and
 St
 Mark
 Matt
 
 
 Mark
 
 and
 St
 Luke
 contents
 himself
 with
 calling
 Bethany
 a
 certain
 village

 although
 he
 was
 perfectly
 aware
 of
 the
 name
 Luke
 
 
 Spikenard
 OintmentThis
 was
 among
 the
 most
 highly
 prized
 of
 oriental
 unguents
 That
 with
 which
 Mary
 anointed
 Jesus
 is
 described
 by
 Matthew
 and
 Mark
 as
 very
 precious
 and
 by
 John
 as
 very
 costly
 In
 the
 original
 the
 adjective
 pistic
 appears
 this
 is
 translated
 by
 some
 as
 meaning
 liquid
 but
 by
 others
 as
 signifying
 genuine
 There
 were
 many
 inferior
 imitations
 of
 the
 real
 spikenard
 or
 nard
 and
 we
 are
 left
 without
 a
 doubt
 that
 Marys
 precious
 gift
 was
 of
 the
 best
 The
 plant
 from
 which
 the
 fragrant
 extract
 is
 obtained
 is
 a
 species
 of
 bearded
 grass
 indigenous
 in
 India
 Spikenard
 is
 mentioned
 in
 Song
 of
 Solomon
 
 
 
 
 HosannaHosanna
 is
 a
 Greek
 form
 of
 the
 Hebrew
 expression
 for
 Save

 or
 Save

 occurs
 in
 the
 original
 of
 Psalm
 
 It
 occurs
 nowhere
 in
 the
 English
 Bible
 except
 in
 the
 acclamations
 of
 the
 people
 at
 Christs
 triumphal
 entry
 into
 Jerusalem
 and
 in
 the
 joyous
 shouts
 of
 children
 in
 the
 temple

 The
 First
 Day
 in
 Passion
 WeekA
 comparison
 of
 the
 accounts
 of
 the
 Lords
 triumphal
 entry
 into
 Jerusalem
 and
 of
 certain
 events
 following
 as
 recorded
 by
 the
 three
 synoptists
 shows
 at
 least
 a
 possibility
 of
 discrepancy
 as
 to
 sequence
 It
 appears
 certain
 that
 Jesus
 visited
 the
 temple
 grounds
 on
 the
 day
 of
 the
 royal
 advent
 into
 the
 city
 From
 Matthew
 
 and
 Luke
 
 and
 the
 context
 preceding
 these
 passages
 the
 inference
 has
 been
 drawn
 that
 the
 second
 clearing
 of
 the
 temple
 occurred
 on
 the
 day
 of
 the
 processional
 entry
 while
 others
 interpret
 Mark
 
 and
 
 as
 meaning
 that
 the
 event
 took
 place
 on
 a
 later
 day
 The
 question
 is
 admittedly
 an
 open
 one
 and
 the
 order
 of
 presentation
 followed
 in
 the
 text
 is
 one
 of
 convenience
 of
 treatment
 based
 on
 rational
 probability

 CHAPTER
 
 JESUS
 RETURNS
 TO
 THE
 TEMPLE
 DAILY
 AN
 INSTRUCTIVE
 INCIDENT
 ON
 THE
 WAY
 On
 the
 morrow
 which
 as
 we
 reckon
 was
 Monday
 the
 second
 day
 of
 Passion
 week
 Jesus
 and
 the
 Twelve
 returned
 to
 Jerusalem
 and
 spent
 the
 greater
 part
 of
 the
 day
 at
 the
 temple
 The
 start
 from
 Bethany
 was
 an
 early
 one
 and
 Jesus
 hungered
 by
 the
 way
 Looking
 ahead
 He
 saw
 a
 fig
 tree
 that
 differed
 from
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 many
 fig
 trees
 of
 the
 region
 in
 that
 it
 was
 in
 full
 leaf
 though
 the
 season
 of
 fruit
 had
 not
 yet
 come
 It
 is
 well
 known
 that
 the
 fruitbuds
 of
 a
 figtree
 appear
 earlier
 than
 do
 the
 leaves
 and
 that
 by
 the
 time
 the
 tree
 is
 in
 full
 foliage
 the
 figs
 are
 well
 advanced
 toward
 maturity
 Moreover
 certain
 species
 of
 figs
 are
 edible
 while
 yet
 green
 indeed
 the
 unripe
 fruit
 is
 relished
 in
 the
 Orient
 at
 the
 present
 time
 It
 would
 be
 reasonable
 therefore
 for
 one
 to
 expect
 to
 find
 edible
 figs
 even
 in
 early
 April
 on
 a
 tree
 that
 was
 already
 covered
 with
 leaves
 When
 Jesus
 and
 His
 party
 reached
 this
 particular
 tree
 which
 had
 rightly
 been
 regarded
 as
 rich
 in
 promise
 of
 fruit
 they
 found
 on
 it
 nothing
 but
 leaves
 it
 was
 a
 showy
 fruitless
 barren
 tree
 It
 was
 destitute
 even
 of
 old
 figs
 those
 of
 the
 preceding
 season
 some
 of
 which
 are
 often
 found
 in
 spring
 on
 fruitful
 trees
 Jesus
 pronounced
 upon
 that
 tree
 the
 sentence
 of
 perpetual
 barrenness
 No
 man
 eat
 fruit
 of
 thee
 hereafter
 forever
 He
 said
 according
 to
 Marks
 account
 or
 as
 Matthew
 records
 the
 judgment
 Let
 no
 fruit
 grow
 on
 thee
 henceforward
 for
 ever
 The
 latter
 writer
 tells
 us
 in
 immediate
 sequence
 that
 presently
 the
 fig
 tree
 withered
 away
 but
 the
 former
 makes
 it
 appear
 that
 the
 effect
 of
 the
 curse
 was
 not
 observed
 until
 the
 following
 morning
 when
 as
 Jesus
 and
 the
 apostles
 were
 once
 again
 on
 the
 way
 between
 Bethany
 and
 Jerusalem
 they
 saw
 that
 the
 fig
 tree
 had
 withered
 and
 dried
 from
 the
 roots
 up
 Peter
 called
 attention
 to
 the
 blasted
 tree
 and
 addressing
 Jesus
 exclaimed
 Master
 behold
 the
 fig
 tree
 which
 thou
 cursedst
 is
 withered
 away
 Applying
 the
 lesson
 of
 the
 occasion
 Jesus
 said
 Have
 faith
 in
 God
 and
 then
 He
 repeated
 some
 of
 His
 former
 assurances
 as
 to
 the
 power
 of
 faith
 by
 which
 even
 mountains
 may
 be
 removed
 should
 there
 be
 need
 of
 such
 miraculous
 accomplishment
 and
 through
 which
 indeed
 any
 necessary
 thing
 may
 be
 done
 The
 blighting
 of
 a
 tree
 was
 shown
 to
 be
 small
 in
 comparison
 with
 the
 greater
 possibilities
 of
 achievement
 through
 faith
 and
 prayer
 But
 to
 so
 achieve
 one
 must
 work
 and
 pray
 without
 reservation
 or
 doubt
 as
 the
 Lord
 thus
 made
 plain
 Therefore
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 What
 things
 soever
 ye
 desire
 when
 ye
 pray
 believe
 that
 ye
 receive
 them
 and
 ye
 shall
 have
 them
 Prayer
 must
 be
 acceptable
 unto
 God
 to
 be
 effective
 and
 it
 follows
 that
 he
 who
 desires
 to
 accomplish
 any
 work
 through
 prayer
 and
 faith
 must
 be
 fit
 to
 present
 himself
 before
 the
 Lord
 in
 supplication
 therefore
 Jesus
 again
 instructed
 the
 apostles
 saying
 And
 when
 ye
 stand
 praying
 forgive
 if
 ye
 have
 ought
 against
 any
 that
 your
 Father
 also
 which
 is
 in
 heaven
 may
 forgive
 you
 your
 trespasses
 But
 if
 ye
 do
 not
 forgive
 neither
 will
 your
 Father
 which
 is
 in
 heaven
 forgive
 your
 trespasses
 The
 blighting
 of
 the
 barren
 fig
 tree
 is
 regarded
 by
 many
 as
 unique
 among
 the
 recorded
 miracles
 of
 Christ
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 while
 all
 the
 others
 were
 wrought
 for
 relief
 blessing
 and
 beneficent
 purposes
 generally
 this
 one
 appears
 as
 an
 act
 of
 judgment
 and
 destructive
 execution
 Nevertheless
 in
 this
 miracle
 the
 Lords
 purpose
 is
 not
 hidden
 and
 the
 result
 while
 fatal
 to
 a
 tree
 is
 of
 lasting
 blessing
 to
 all
 who
 would
 learn
 and
 profit
 by
 the
 works
 of
 God
 If
 no
 more
 has
 been
 accomplished
 by
 the
 miracle
 than
 the
 presenting
 of
 so
 impressive
 an
 object
 lesson
 for
 the
 instructions
 that
 followed
 that
 smitten
 tree
 has
 proved
 of
 greater
 service
 to
 humanity
 than
 have
 all
 the
 fig
 orchards
 of
 Bethphage
 To
 the
 apostles
 the
 act
 was
 another
 and
 an
 indisputable
 proof
 of
 the
 Lords
 power
 over
 nature
 His
 control
 of
 natural
 forces
 and
 all
 material
 things
 His
 jurisdiction
 over
 life
 and
 death
 He
 had
 healed
 multitudes
 the
 wind
 and
 the
 waves
 had
 obeyed
 His
 words
 on
 three
 occasions
 He
 had
 restored
 the
 dead
 to
 life
 it
 was
 fitting
 that
 He
 should
 demonstrate
 His
 power
 to
 smite
 and
 to
 destroy
 In
 manifesting
 His
 command
 over
 death
 He
 had
 mercifully
 raised
 a
 maiden
 from
 the
 couch
 on
 which
 she
 had
 died
 a
 young
 man
 from
 the
 bier
 on
 which
 he
 was
 being
 carried
 to
 the
 grave
 another
 from
 the
 sepulchre
 in
 which
 he
 had
 been
 laid
 away
 a
 corpse
 but
 in
 proof
 of
 His
 power
 to
 destroy
 by
 a
 word
 He
 chose
 a
 barren
 and
 worthless
 tree
 for
 His
 subject
 Could
 any
 of
 the
 Twelve
 doubt
 when
 a
 few
 days
 later
 they
 saw
 Him
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 vindictive
 priests
 and
 heartless
 pagans
 that
 did
 He
 so
 will
 He
 could
 smite
 His
 enemies
 by
 a
 word
 even
 unto
 death
 Yet
 not
 until
 after
 His
 glorious
 resurrection
 did
 even
 the
 apostles
 realize
 how
 truly
 voluntary
 His
 sacrifice
 had
 been
 But
 the
 fate
 that
 befell
 the
 barren
 fig
 tree
 is
 instructive
 from
 another
 point
 of
 view
 The
 incident
 is
 as
 much
 parable
 as
 miracle
 That
 leafy
 tree
 was
 distinguished
 among
 fig
 trees
 the
 others
 offered
 no
 invitation
 gave
 no
 promise
 the
 time
 of
 figs
 was
 not
 yet
 they
 in
 due
 season
 would
 bring
 forth
 fruit
 and
 leaves
 but
 this
 precocious
 and
 leafy
 pretender
 waved
 its
 umbrageous
 limbs
 as
 in
 boastful
 assertion
 of
 superiority
 For
 those
 who
 responded
 to
 its
 ostentatious
 invitation
 for
 the
 hungering
 Christ
 who
 came
 seeking
 fruit
 it
 had
 naught
 but
 leaves
 Even
 for
 the
 purposes
 of
 the
 lesson
 involved
 we
 cannot
 conceive
 of
 the
 tree
 being
 blighted
 primarily
 because
 it
 was
 fruitless
 for
 at
 that
 season
 the
 other
 fig
 trees
 were
 bare
 of
 fruit
 also
 it
 was
 made
 the
 object
 of
 the
 curse
 and
 the
 subject
 of
 the
 Lords
 instructive
 discourse
 because
 having
 leaves
 it
 was
 deceptively
 barren
 Were
 it
 reasonable
 to
 regard
 the
 tree
 as
 possessed
 of
 moral
 agency
 we
 would
 have
 to
 pronounce
 it
 a
 hypocrite
 its
 utter
 barrenness
 coupled
 with
 its
 abundance
 of
 foliage
 made
 of
 it
 a
 type
 of
 human
 hypocrisy
 The
 leafy
 fruitless
 tree
 was
 a
 symbol
 of
 Judaism
 which
 loudly
 proclaimed
 itself
 as
 the
 only
 true
 religion
 of
 the
 age
 and
 condescendingly
 invited
 all
 the
 world
 to
 come
 and
 partake
 of
 its
 rich
 ripe
 fruit
 when
 in
 truth
 it
 was
 but
 an
 unnatural
 growth
 of
 leaves
 with
 no
 fruit
 of
 the
 season
 nor
 even
 an
 edible
 bulb
 held
 over
 from
 earlier
 years
 for
 such
 as
 it
 had
 of
 former
 fruitage
 was
 dried
 to
 worthlessness
 and
 made
 repulsive
 in
 its
 wormeaten
 decay
 The
 religion
 of
 Israel
 had
 degenerated
 into
 an
 artificial
 religionism
 which
 in
 pretentious
 show
 and
 empty
 profession
 outclassed
 the
 abominations
 of
 heathendom
 As
 already
 pointed
 out
 in
 these
 pages
 the
 fig
 tree
 was
 a
 favorite
 type
 in
 rabbinical
 representation
 of
 the
 Jewish
 race
 and
 the
 Lord
 had
 before
 adopted
 the
 symbolism
 in
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Barren
 Fig
 Tree
 that
 worthless
 growth
 which
 did
 but
 cumber
 the
 ground
 SECOND
 CLEARING
 OF
 THE
 TEMPLE
 Within
 the
 temple
 grounds
 Jesus
 was
 filled
 with
 indignation
 at
 the
 scene
 of
 tumult
 and
 desecration
 which
 the
 place
 presented
 Three
 years
 before
 at
 Passover
 time
 He
 had
 been
 wrought
 up
 to
 a
 high
 state
 of
 righteous
 anger
 by
 a
 similar
 exhibition
 of
 sordid
 chaffering
 within
 the
 sacred
 precincts
 and
 had
 driven
 out
 the
 sheep
 and
 oxen
 and
 forcibly
 expelled
 the
 traders
 and
 the
 moneychangers
 and
 all
 who
 were
 using
 His
 Fathers
 house
 as
 a
 house
 of
 merchandize
 That
 was
 near
 the
 beginning
 of
 His
 public
 labor
 and
 the
 vigorous
 action
 was
 among
 the
 first
 of
 His
 works
 to
 attract
 general
 attention
 now
 within
 four
 days
 of
 the
 cross
 He
 cleared
 the
 courts
 again
 by
 casting
 out
 all
 them
 that
 sold
 and
 bought
 in
 the
 temple
 and
 overthrew
 the
 tables
 of
 the
 moneychangers
 and
 the
 seats
 of
 them
 that
 sold
 doves
 nor
 would
 He
 suffer
 any
 to
 carry
 their
 buckets
 and
 baskets
 through
 the
 enclosure
 as
 many
 were
 in
 the
 habit
 of
 doing
 and
 so
 making
 the
 way
 a
 common
 thoroughfare
 Is
 it
 not
 written
 He
 demanded
 of
 them
 in
 wrath
 My
 house
 shall
 be
 called
 of
 all
 nations
 the
 house
 of
 prayer
 but
 ye
 have
 made
 it
 a
 den
 of
 thieves
 On
 the
 former
 occasion
 before
 He
 had
 declared
 or
 even
 confessed
 His
 Messiahship
 He
 had
 designated
 the
 temple
 as
 My
 Fathers
 house
 now
 that
 He
 had
 openly
 avowed
 Himself
 to
 be
 the
 Christ
 He
 called
 it
 My
 house
 The
 expressions
 are
 in
 a
 sense
 synonymous
 He
 and
 the
 Father
 were
 and
 are
 one
 in
 possession
 and
 dominion
 The
 means
 by
 which
 the
 later
 expulsion
 was
 accomplished
 are
 not
 stated
 but
 it
 is
 plain
 that
 none
 could
 withstand
 His
 authoritative
 command
 He
 acted
 in
 the
 strength
 of
 righteousness
 before
 which
 the
 forces
 of
 evil
 had
 to
 give
 way
 His
 wrath
 of
 indignation
 was
 followed
 by
 the
 calmness
 of
 gentle
 ministry
 there
 in
 the
 cleared
 courts
 of
 His
 house
 blind
 and
 lame
 folk
 came
 limping
 and
 groping
 about
 Him
 and
 He
 healed
 them
 The
 anger
 of
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 scribes
 was
 raging
 against
 Him
 but
 it
 was
 impotent
 They
 had
 decreed
 His
 death
 and
 had
 made
 repeated
 efforts
 to
 take
 Him
 and
 there
 He
 sat
 within
 the
 very
 area
 over
 which
 they
 claimed
 supreme
 jurisdiction
 and
 they
 were
 afraid
 to
 touch
 Him
 because
 of
 the
 common
 people
 whom
 they
 professed
 to
 despize
 yet
 heartily
 fearedfor
 all
 the
 people
 were
 very
 attentive
 to
 hear
 him
 The
 rage
 of
 the
 officials
 was
 further
 aggravated
 by
 a
 touching
 incident
 which
 seems
 to
 have
 accompanied
 or
 to
 have
 immediately
 followed
 His
 merciful
 healing
 of
 the
 afflicted
 folk
 at
 the
 temple
 Children
 saw
 what
 He
 did
 with
 their
 innocent
 minds
 yet
 unsullied
 by
 the
 prejudice
 of
 tradition
 and
 their
 sight
 yet
 undarkened
 by
 sin
 they
 perceived
 in
 Him
 the
 Christ
 and
 burst
 forth
 into
 praise
 and
 worship
 in
 a
 hymn
 that
 was
 heard
 by
 the
 angels
 Hosanna
 to
 the
 son
 of
 David
 With
 illconcealed
 anger
 the
 temple
 officials
 demanded
 of
 Him
 Hearest
 thou
 what
 these
 say
 They
 probably
 expected
 Him
 to
 disclaim
 the
 title
 or
 possibly
 hoped
 that
 He
 would
 reassert
 His
 claim
 in
 a
 manner
 that
 would
 afford
 excuse
 for
 legal
 action
 against
 Him
 for
 to
 most
 of
 them
 the
 Son
 of
 David
 was
 the
 Messiah
 the
 promised
 King
 Would
 He
 clear
 Himself
 of
 the
 blasphemy
 that
 attached
 to
 the
 unjustified
 acknowledgment
 of
 so
 awful
 a
 dignity
 Jesus
 answered
 with
 an
 implied
 rebuke
 for
 their
 ignorance
 of
 the
 scriptures
 Yea
 have
 ye
 never
 read
 Out
 of
 the
 mouth
 of
 babes
 and
 sucklings
 thou
 hast
 perfected
 praise
 It
 was
 now
 Monday
 evening
 Jesus
 left
 the
 city
 and
 retired
 again
 to
 Bethany
 where
 He
 lodged
 This
 course
 was
 a
 prudent
 one
 in
 view
 of
 the
 determination
 of
 the
 rulers
 to
 get
 Him
 into
 their
 power
 provided
 they
 could
 do
 so
 without
 arousing
 the
 people
 This
 they
 could
 not
 accomplish
 by
 day
 for
 wherever
 He
 appeared
 He
 was
 the
 center
 of
 a
 multitude
 but
 had
 He
 remained
 in
 Jerusalem
 over
 night
 the
 vigilant
 emissaries
 of
 the
 hierarchy
 might
 have
 succeeded
 in
 taking
 Him
 unless
 He
 withstood
 them
 by
 some
 miraculous
 action
 Near
 as
 was
 His
 hour
 it
 had
 not
 yet
 struck
 and
 He
 would
 be
 made
 captive
 only
 as
 He
 permitted
 Himself
 a
 voluntary
 victim
 to
 be
 taken
 into
 the
 hands
 of
 His
 enemies
 CHRISTS
 AUTHORITY
 CHALLENGED
 BY
 THE
 RULERS
 On
 the
 following
 day
 that
 is
 on
 Tuesday
 He
 returned
 to
 the
 temple
 with
 the
 Twelve
 passing
 the
 withered
 fig
 tree
 on
 the
 way
 and
 impressing
 the
 moral
 of
 the
 combined
 miracle
 and
 parable
 as
 we
 have
 already
 seen
 As
 He
 taught
 in
 the
 sacred
 place
 preaching
 the
 gospel
 to
 all
 who
 would
 hear
 the
 chief
 priests
 with
 a
 number
 of
 scribes
 and
 elders
 came
 upon
 Him
 in
 a
 body
 They
 had
 been
 debating
 about
 Him
 over
 night
 and
 had
 resolved
 on
 at
 least
 one
 step
 they
 would
 challenge
 His
 authority
 for
 what
 He
 had
 done
 the
 day
 before
 They
 were
 the
 guardians
 of
 the
 temple
 both
 the
 material
 structure
 and
 the
 theocratic
 system
 for
 which
 the
 holy
 edifice
 stood
 and
 this
 Galilean
 who
 permitted
 Himself
 to
 be
 called
 the
 Christ
 and
 defended
 those
 who
 so
 acclaimed
 Him
 had
 for
 the
 second
 time
 ignored
 their
 authority
 within
 the
 temple
 walls
 and
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 common
 people
 over
 whom
 they
 lorded
 so
 arrogantly
 So
 this
 official
 deputation
 with
 plans
 matured
 came
 to
 Him
 saying
 By
 what
 authority
 doest
 thou
 these
 things
 and
 who
 gave
 thee
 this
 authority
 This
 action
 was
 doubtless
 a
 preliminary
 step
 in
 a
 preconcerted
 attempt
 to
 suppress
 the
 activities
 of
 Jesus
 both
 of
 word
 and
 deed
 within
 the
 temple
 precincts
 It
 will
 be
 remembered
 that
 after
 the
 first
 cleansing
 of
 the
 temple
 the
 Jews
 had
 angrily
 demanded
 of
 Jesus
 a
 sign
 by
 which
 they
 might
 judge
 the
 question
 of
 His
 divine
 commission
 and
 it
 is
 significant
 that
 on
 this
 latter
 occasion
 no
 sign
 was
 asked
 but
 instead
 thereof
 a
 specific
 avowal
 as
 to
 the
 authority
 He
 possessed
 and
 by
 whom
 it
 had
 been
 given
 Him
 A
 three
 years
 course
 of
 miracle
 and
 teaching
 was
 known
 to
 them
 on
 the
 yesterday
 blind
 and
 lame
 had
 been
 healed
 inside
 the
 temple
 walls
 and
 Lazarus
 the
 living
 testimony
 of
 the
 Lords
 power
 over
 death
 and
 the
 grave
 was
 before
 them
 To
 ask
 a
 further
 sign
 would
 have
 been
 to
 flagrantly
 expose
 themselves
 to
 the
 ridicule
 of
 the
 people
 They
 knew
 what
 authority
 the
 Lord
 claimed
 their
 question
 was
 of
 sinister
 purpose
 Jesus
 did
 not
 condescend
 to
 voice
 an
 answer
 in
 which
 they
 could
 possibly
 find
 further
 excuse
 for
 antagonizing
 Him
 but
 He
 availed
 Himself
 of
 a
 method
 very
 common
 among
 themselvesthat
 of
 countering
 one
 question
 with
 another
 And
 Jesus
 answered
 and
 said
 unto
 them
 I
 also
 will
 ask
 you
 one
 thing
 which
 if
 ye
 tell
 me
 I
 in
 like
 wise
 will
 tell
 you
 by
 what
 authority
 I
 do
 these
 things
 The
 baptism
 of
 John
 whence
 was
 it
 from
 heaven
 or
 of
 men
 They
 consulted
 among
 themselves
 as
 to
 what
 answer
 would
 best
 serve
 to
 extricate
 them
 from
 an
 embarrassing
 position
 no
 mention
 is
 made
 of
 any
 attempt
 to
 ascertain
 the
 truth
 and
 reply
 accordingly
 they
 were
 thoroughly
 nonplussed
 Should
 they
 answer
 that
 Johns
 baptism
 was
 of
 God
 Jesus
 would
 probably
 demand
 of
 them
 why
 then
 they
 had
 not
 believed
 in
 the
 Baptist
 and
 why
 they
 did
 not
 accept
 Johns
 testimony
 concerning
 Himself
 On
 the
 other
 hand
 should
 they
 aver
 that
 John
 had
 no
 divine
 authority
 to
 preach
 and
 baptize
 the
 people
 would
 turn
 against
 them
 for
 the
 martyred
 Baptist
 was
 revered
 by
 the
 masses
 as
 a
 prophet
 In
 spite
 of
 their
 boasted
 learning
 they
 answered
 as
 puzzled
 schoolboys
 might
 do
 when
 they
 perceive
 hidden
 difficulties
 in
 what
 at
 first
 seemed
 but
 a
 simple
 problem
 We
 cannot
 tell
 said
 they
 Then
 Jesus
 replied
 Neither
 tell
 I
 you
 by
 what
 authority
 I
 do
 these
 things
 Chief
 priests
 scribes
 and
 elders
 of
 the
 people
 were
 outwitted
 and
 humiliated
 The
 tables
 were
 completely
 turned
 upon
 them
 Jesus
 whom
 they
 had
 come
 to
 question
 became
 the
 examiner
 they
 a
 class
 of
 cowed
 and
 unwilling
 listeners
 He
 the
 ready
 instructor
 and
 the
 multitude
 interested
 observers
 With
 little
 likelihood
 of
 immediate
 interruption
 the
 Master
 proceeded
 in
 calm
 deliberation
 to
 relate
 to
 them
 a
 series
 of
 three
 splendid
 stories
 each
 of
 which
 they
 felt
 applied
 to
 themselves
 with
 incisive
 certainty
 The
 first
 of
 the
 narrations
 we
 call
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Two
 Sons
 But
 what
 think
 ye
 A
 certain
 man
 had
 two
 sons
 and
 he
 came
 to
 the
 first
 and
 said
 Son
 go
 work
 today
 in
 my
 vineyard
 He
 answered
 and
 said
 I
 will
 not
 but
 afterward
 he
 repented
 and
 went
 And
 he
 came
 to
 the
 second
 and
 said
 likewise
 And
 he
 answered
 and
 said
 I
 go
 sir
 and
 went
 not
 Whether
 of
 them
 twain
 did
 the
 will
 of
 his
 father
 They
 say
 unto
 him
 The
 first
 Jesus
 saith
 unto
 them
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 the
 publicans
 and
 the
 harlots
 go
 into
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 before
 you
 For
 John
 came
 unto
 you
 in
 the
 way
 of
 righteousness
 and
 ye
 believed
 him
 not
 but
 the
 publicans
 and
 the
 harlots
 believed
 him
 and
 ye
 when
 ye
 had
 seen
 it
 repented
 not
 afterward
 that
 ye
 might
 believe
 him
 The
 opening
 sentence
 But
 what
 think
 ye
 was
 a
 call
 to
 close
 attention
 It
 implied
 a
 question
 soon
 to
 follow
 and
 that
 proved
 to
 be
 Which
 of
 the
 two
 sons
 was
 the
 obedient
 one
 There
 was
 but
 one
 consistent
 answer
 and
 they
 had
 to
 give
 it
 however
 loath
 The
 application
 of
 the
 parable
 followed
 with
 convicting
 promptness
 They
 the
 chief
 priests
 scribes
 Pharisees
 and
 elders
 of
 the
 people
 were
 typified
 by
 the
 second
 son
 who
 when
 told
 to
 labor
 in
 the
 vineyard
 answered
 so
 assuringly
 but
 went
 not
 though
 the
 vines
 were
 running
 to
 wild
 growth
 for
 want
 of
 pruning
 and
 such
 poor
 fruit
 as
 might
 mature
 would
 be
 left
 to
 fall
 and
 rot
 upon
 the
 ground
 The
 publicans
 and
 sinners
 upon
 whom
 they
 vented
 their
 contempt
 whose
 touch
 was
 defilement
 were
 like
 unto
 the
 first
 son
 who
 in
 rude
 though
 frank
 refusal
 ignored
 the
 fathers
 call
 but
 afterward
 relented
 and
 set
 to
 work
 repentantly
 hoping
 to
 make
 amends
 for
 the
 time
 he
 had
 lost
 and
 for
 the
 unfilial
 spirit
 he
 had
 shown
 Publicans
 and
 sinners
 touched
 in
 their
 hearts
 by
 the
 clarion
 call
 to
 repentance
 had
 flocked
 to
 the
 Baptist
 in
 the
 wilderness
 with
 the
 earnest
 inquiry
 Master
 what
 shall
 we
 do
 Johns
 call
 had
 been
 to
 no
 particular
 class
 but
 while
 selfconfessed
 sinners
 had
 repented
 and
 sought
 baptism
 at
 his
 hands
 those
 very
 Pharisees
 and
 elders
 of
 the
 people
 had
 rejected
 his
 testimony
 and
 had
 hypocritically
 sought
 to
 ensnare
 him
 Through
 the
 parable
 Jesus
 answered
 His
 own
 question
 as
 to
 whether
 the
 baptism
 of
 John
 was
 of
 God
 or
 of
 man
 The
 Lords
 affirmation
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 the
 publicans
 and
 the
 harlots
 go
 into
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 before
 you
 was
 condemnatory
 of
 the
 corrupt
 though
 sanctimonious
 polity
 of
 the
 hierarchy
 throughout
 It
 was
 not
 wholly
 without
 intimation
 of
 possible
 reformation
 however
 He
 did
 not
 say
 that
 the
 repentant
 sinners
 should
 enter
 and
 the
 priestly
 hypocrites
 stand
 forever
 excluded
 for
 the
 latter
 there
 was
 hope
 if
 they
 would
 but
 repent
 though
 they
 would
 have
 to
 follow
 not
 lead
 in
 the
 glorious
 procession
 of
 the
 redeemed
 In
 a
 continuation
 of
 the
 same
 discourse
 the
 Lord
 presented
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Wicked
 Husbandmen
 as
 follows
 Hear
 another
 parable
 There
 was
 a
 certain
 householder
 which
 planted
 a
 vineyard
 and
 hedged
 it
 round
 about
 and
 digged
 a
 winepress
 in
 it
 and
 built
 a
 tower
 and
 let
 it
 out
 to
 husbandmen
 and
 went
 into
 a
 far
 country
 And
 when
 the
 time
 of
 the
 fruit
 drew
 near
 he
 sent
 his
 servants
 to
 the
 husbandmen
 that
 they
 might
 receive
 the
 fruits
 of
 it
 And
 the
 husbandmen
 took
 his
 servants
 and
 beat
 one
 and
 killed
 another
 and
 stoned
 another
 Again
 he
 sent
 other
 servants
 more
 than
 the
 first
 and
 they
 did
 unto
 them
 likewise
 But
 last
 of
 all
 he
 sent
 unto
 them
 his
 son
 saying
 They
 will
 reverence
 my
 son
 But
 when
 the
 husbandmen
 saw
 the
 son
 they
 said
 among
 themselves
 This
 is
 the
 heir
 come
 let
 us
 kill
 him
 and
 let
 us
 seize
 on
 his
 inheritance
 And
 they
 caught
 him
 and
 cast
 him
 out
 of
 the
 vineyard
 and
 slew
 him
 When
 the
 lord
 therefore
 of
 the
 vineyard
 cometh
 what
 will
 he
 do
 unto
 those
 husbandmen
 They
 say
 unto
 him
 He
 will
 miserably
 destroy
 those
 wicked
 men
 and
 will
 let
 out
 his
 vineyard
 unto
 other
 husbandmen
 which
 shall
 render
 him
 the
 fruits
 in
 their
 seasons
 Again
 the
 Jews
 were
 compelled
 to
 make
 answer
 to
 the
 great
 question
 with
 which
 the
 parable
 dealt
 and
 again
 by
 their
 answer
 they
 pronounced
 judgment
 upon
 themselves
 The
 vineyard
 broadly
 speaking
 was
 the
 human
 family
 but
 more
 specifically
 the
 covenant
 people
 Israel
 the
 soil
 was
 good
 and
 capable
 of
 yielding
 in
 rich
 abundance
 the
 vines
 were
 choice
 and
 had
 been
 set
 out
 with
 care
 and
 the
 whole
 vineyard
 was
 amply
 protected
 with
 a
 hedge
 and
 suitably
 furnished
 with
 winepress
 and
 tower
 The
 husbandmen
 could
 be
 none
 other
 than
 the
 priests
 and
 teachers
 of
 Israel
 including
 the
 ecclesiastical
 leaders
 who
 were
 then
 and
 there
 present
 in
 an
 official
 capacity
 The
 Lord
 of
 the
 vineyard
 had
 sent
 among
 the
 people
 prophets
 authorized
 to
 speak
 in
 His
 name
 and
 these
 the
 wicked
 tenants
 had
 rejected
 maltreated
 and
 in
 many
 instances
 cruelly
 slain
 In
 the
 more
 detailed
 reports
 of
 the
 parable
 we
 read
 that
 when
 the
 first
 servant
 came
 the
 cruel
 husbandmen
 beat
 him
 and
 sent
 him
 away
 empty
 the
 next
 they
 wounded
 in
 the
 head
 and
 sent
 him
 away
 shamefully
 handled
 another
 they
 murdered
 and
 all
 who
 came
 later
 were
 brutally
 mistreated
 and
 some
 of
 them
 were
 killed
 Those
 wicked
 men
 had
 used
 the
 vineyard
 of
 their
 Lord
 for
 personal
 gain
 and
 had
 rendered
 no
 part
 of
 the
 vintage
 to
 the
 lawful
 Owner
 When
 the
 Lord
 sent
 other
 messengers
 more
 than
 the
 first
 or
 in
 other
 words
 greater
 than
 the
 earlier
 ones
 the
 most
 recent
 example
 being
 John
 the
 Baptist
 the
 husbandmen
 rejected
 them
 with
 evil
 determination
 more
 pronounced
 than
 ever
 At
 last
 the
 Son
 had
 come
 in
 person
 His
 authority
 they
 feared
 as
 that
 of
 the
 lawful
 heir
 and
 with
 malignity
 almost
 beyond
 belief
 they
 determined
 to
 kill
 Him
 that
 they
 might
 perpetuate
 their
 unworthy
 possession
 of
 the
 vineyard
 and
 thenceforward
 hold
 it
 as
 their
 own
 Jesus
 carried
 the
 story
 without
 break
 from
 the
 criminal
 past
 to
 the
 yet
 more
 tragic
 and
 awful
 future
 then
 but
 three
 days
 distant
 and
 calmly
 related
 in
 prophetic
 imagery
 as
 though
 already
 fulfilled
 how
 those
 evil
 men
 cast
 the
 well
 beloved
 Son
 out
 of
 the
 vineyard
 and
 slew
 Him
 Unable
 to
 evade
 the
 searching
 question
 as
 to
 what
 the
 Lord
 of
 the
 vineyard
 would
 naturally
 and
 righteously
 do
 to
 the
 wicked
 husbandmen
 the
 Jewish
 rulers
 gave
 the
 only
 pertinent
 answer
 possiblethat
 He
 would
 surely
 destroy
 those
 wretched
 sinners
 and
 let
 out
 His
 vineyard
 to
 tenants
 who
 were
 more
 honest
 and
 worthy
 Suddenly
 changing
 the
 figure
 Jesus
 saith
 unto
 them
 Did
 ye
 never
 read
 in
 the
 scriptures
 The
 stone
 which
 the
 builders
 rejected
 the
 same
 is
 become
 the
 head
 of
 the
 corner
 this
 is
 the
 Lords
 doing
 and
 it
 is
 marvellous
 in
 our
 eyes
 Therefore
 say
 I
 unto
 you
 The
 kingdom
 of
 God
 shall
 be
 taken
 from
 you
 and
 given
 to
 a
 nation
 bringing
 forth
 the
 fruits
 thereof
 And
 whosoever
 shall
 fall
 on
 this
 stone
 shall
 be
 broken
 but
 on
 whomsoever
 it
 shall
 fall
 it
 will
 grind
 him
 to
 powder
 There
 could
 be
 no
 misapprehension
 as
 to
 the
 Lords
 meaning
 the
 rejected
 Stone
 which
 was
 eventually
 to
 have
 chief
 place
 the
 head
 of
 the
 corner
 in
 the
 edifice
 of
 salvation
 was
 Himself
 the
 Messiah
 To
 some
 that
 Stone
 would
 be
 a
 cause
 of
 stumbling
 wo
 unto
 them
 for
 thereby
 would
 they
 be
 broken
 and
 only
 through
 repentance
 and
 works
 of
 righteousness
 could
 they
 even
 in
 part
 recover
 but
 upon
 others
 those
 who
 would
 persist
 in
 their
 opposition
 the
 Stone
 would
 fall
 in
 judgment
 and
 wo
 wo
 to
 them
 for
 beneath
 it
 they
 would
 be
 destroyed
 as
 though
 ground
 to
 powder
 From
 them
 the
 leaders
 and
 from
 the
 people
 who
 followed
 their
 unholy
 precepts
 and
 foul
 example
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 was
 about
 to
 be
 taken
 and
 would
 in
 time
 be
 given
 to
 the
 Gentiles
 who
 the
 Lord
 affirmed
 would
 prove
 more
 worthy
 than
 Israel
 had
 been
 We
 gather
 from
 Lukes
 account
 that
 in
 contemplation
 of
 this
 awful
 penalty
 they
 whether
 priestly
 rulers
 or
 common
 people
 we
 are
 not
 told
 exclaimed
 in
 despair
 God
 forbid
 As
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 Pharisees
 realized
 the
 completeness
 of
 their
 discomfiture
 and
 the
 extent
 of
 the
 humiliation
 to
 which
 they
 had
 been
 subjected
 in
 the
 eyes
 of
 the
 people
 they
 were
 incensed
 beyond
 measure
 and
 even
 attempted
 to
 lay
 hold
 on
 Jesus
 there
 in
 the
 temple
 but
 the
 sympathies
 of
 the
 multitude
 were
 so
 unmistakably
 in
 His
 favor
 that
 the
 angry
 ecclesiasts
 desisted
 The
 people
 in
 general
 while
 not
 prepared
 to
 openly
 proclaim
 Him
 as
 the
 Christ
 knew
 that
 He
 was
 a
 prophet
 of
 God
 and
 their
 dread
 of
 official
 displeasure
 and
 possible
 penalty
 did
 not
 deter
 them
 from
 friendly
 demonstrations
 Jesus
 resumed
 His
 teaching
 by
 relating
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Royal
 Marriage
 Feast
 And
 Jesus
 answered
 and
 spake
 unto
 them
 again
 by
 parables
 and
 said
 The
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 like
 unto
 a
 certain
 king
 which
 made
 a
 marriage
 for
 his
 son
 And
 sent
 forth
 his
 servants
 to
 call
 them
 that
 were
 bidden
 to
 the
 wedding
 and
 they
 would
 not
 come
 Again
 he
 sent
 forth
 other
 servants
 saying
 Tell
 them
 which
 are
 bidden
 Behold
 I
 have
 prepared
 my
 dinner
 my
 oxen
 and
 my
 fatlings
 are
 killed
 and
 all
 things
 are
 ready
 come
 unto
 the
 marriage
 But
 they
 made
 light
 of
 it
 and
 went
 their
 ways
 one
 to
 his
 farm
 another
 to
 his
 merchandise
 And
 the
 remnant
 took
 his
 servants
 and
 entreated
 them
 spitefully
 and
 slew
 them
 But
 when
 the
 king
 heard
 thereof
 he
 was
 wroth
 and
 he
 sent
 forth
 his
 armies
 and
 destroyed
 those
 murderers
 and
 burned
 up
 their
 city
 Then
 saith
 he
 to
 his
 servants
 The
 wedding
 is
 ready
 but
 they
 which
 were
 bidden
 were
 not
 worthy
 Go
 ye
 therefore
 into
 the
 highways
 and
 as
 many
 as
 ye
 shall
 find
 bid
 to
 the
 marriage
 So
 those
 servants
 went
 out
 into
 the
 highways
 and
 gathered
 together
 all
 as
 many
 as
 they
 found
 both
 bad
 and
 good
 and
 the
 wedding
 was
 furnished
 with
 guests
 The
 invitation
 of
 a
 king
 to
 his
 subjects
 is
 equivalent
 to
 a
 command
 The
 marriage
 feast
 was
 no
 surprize
 event
 for
 the
 selected
 guests
 had
 been
 bidden
 long
 aforetime
 and
 in
 accordance
 with
 oriental
 custom
 were
 notified
 again
 on
 the
 opening
 day
 of
 the
 festivities
 which
 according
 to
 Hebrew
 customs
 would
 be
 understood
 as
 extending
 over
 a
 period
 of
 seven
 or
 fourteen
 days
 in
 this
 case
 of
 a
 marriage
 in
 the
 royal
 family
 the
 greater
 duration
 would
 be
 assumed
 Many
 of
 the
 bidden
 guests
 refused
 to
 come
 when
 formally
 summoned
 and
 of
 the
 tolerant
 kings
 later
 and
 more
 pressing
 message
 they
 made
 light
 and
 went
 their
 ways
 while
 the
 most
 wicked
 turned
 upon
 the
 servants
 who
 brought
 the
 royal
 summons
 mistreated
 them
 cruelly
 and
 some
 of
 them
 they
 killed
 It
 is
 plainly
 evident
 that
 the
 refusal
 to
 attend
 the
 kings
 feast
 was
 a
 deliberate
 rebellion
 against
 the
 royal
 authority
 and
 a
 personal
 indignity
 against
 both
 the
 reigning
 sovereign
 and
 his
 son
 It
 was
 as
 much
 a
 duty
 as
 an
 honor
 for
 loyal
 subjects
 to
 attend
 the
 marriage
 festival
 of
 the
 prince
 whom
 we
 cannot
 err
 in
 regarding
 as
 the
 lawful
 heir
 to
 the
 throne
 and
 therefore
 the
 one
 who
 might
 some
 day
 reign
 over
 them
 The
 turning
 away
 by
 one
 man
 to
 his
 farm
 and
 by
 another
 to
 his
 merchandize
 is
 in
 part
 an
 evidence
 of
 their
 engrossment
 in
 material
 pursuits
 to
 the
 utter
 disregard
 of
 their
 sovereigns
 will
 but
 it
 signifies
 further
 an
 effort
 to
 deaden
 their
 troubled
 consciences
 by
 some
 absorbing
 occupation
 and
 possibly
 also
 a
 premeditated
 demonstration
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 they
 placed
 their
 personal
 affairs
 above
 the
 call
 of
 their
 king
 The
 monarch
 executed
 a
 terrible
 retribution
 upon
 his
 rebellious
 subjects
 If
 the
 parable
 was
 intended
 to
 be
 an
 allegorical
 presentation
 of
 actual
 events
 it
 passes
 at
 this
 point
 from
 the
 story
 of
 the
 past
 to
 that
 of
 the
 future
 for
 the
 destruction
 of
 Jerusalem
 postdates
 by
 several
 decades
 the
 death
 of
 Christ
 Finding
 the
 guests
 who
 had
 some
 claim
 on
 the
 royal
 invitation
 to
 be
 utterly
 unworthy
 the
 king
 sent
 out
 his
 servants
 again
 and
 these
 gathered
 in
 from
 the
 highways
 and
 crossroads
 from
 the
 byways
 and
 the
 lanes
 all
 they
 could
 find
 irrespective
 of
 rank
 or
 station
 whether
 rich
 or
 poor
 good
 or
 bad
 and
 the
 wedding
 was
 furnished
 with
 guests
 The
 great
 feast
 by
 which
 the
 Messianic
 reign
 was
 to
 be
 ushered
 in
 was
 a
 favorite
 theme
 of
 jubilant
 exposition
 in
 both
 synagog
 and
 school
 and
 exultation
 ran
 high
 in
 the
 rabbinical
 dictum
 that
 none
 but
 the
 children
 of
 Abraham
 would
 be
 among
 the
 blessed
 partakers
 The
 king
 in
 the
 parable
 is
 God
 the
 son
 whose
 marriage
 was
 the
 occasion
 of
 the
 feast
 is
 Jesus
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 the
 guests
 who
 were
 bidden
 early
 yet
 who
 refused
 to
 come
 when
 the
 feast
 was
 ready
 are
 the
 covenant
 people
 who
 rejected
 their
 Lord
 the
 Christ
 the
 later
 guests
 who
 were
 brought
 in
 from
 the
 streets
 and
 the
 roads
 are
 the
 Gentile
 nations
 to
 whom
 the
 gospel
 has
 been
 carried
 since
 its
 rejection
 by
 the
 Jews
 the
 marriage
 feast
 is
 symbolical
 of
 the
 glorious
 consummation
 of
 the
 Messiahs
 mission
 All
 students
 of
 the
 subject
 must
 have
 noted
 the
 points
 of
 resemblance
 by
 which
 this
 parable
 is
 related
 to
 that
 of
 the
 great
 supper
 fewer
 perhaps
 have
 considered
 the
 differences
 between
 the
 two
 The
 earlier
 story
 was
 told
 in
 the
 house
 of
 one
 of
 the
 chief
 Pharisees
 probably
 in
 some
 town
 in
 Perea
 the
 later
 one
 was
 related
 within
 the
 temple
 after
 Pharisaic
 opposition
 to
 Christ
 had
 reached
 its
 height
 The
 first
 is
 of
 simpler
 plot
 and
 of
 gentler
 climax
 The
 neglect
 of
 the
 invited
 guests
 in
 the
 first
 story
 was
 accompanied
 by
 excuses
 in
 which
 some
 approach
 to
 polite
 apology
 appears
 the
 refusal
 of
 those
 bidden
 in
 the
 second
 parable
 was
 markedly
 offensive
 and
 was
 coupled
 with
 outrageous
 abuse
 and
 murder
 The
 host
 in
 one
 instance
 was
 a
 wealthy
 though
 private
 citizen
 in
 the
 other
 the
 giver
 of
 the
 feast
 was
 a
 king
 In
 the
 first
 the
 occasion
 was
 one
 of
 ordinary
 though
 abundant
 entertainment
 in
 the
 second
 the
 determining
 time
 was
 that
 of
 the
 appointed
 marriage
 of
 the
 royal
 heir
 Retribution
 in
 the
 first
 instance
 was
 limited
 to
 exclusion
 from
 the
 banquet
 in
 the
 latter
 the
 individual
 punishment
 was
 death
 which
 was
 followed
 by
 the
 punitive
 example
 of
 the
 citys
 destruction
 Our
 account
 of
 the
 royal
 marriage
 feast
 is
 not
 yet
 complete
 the
 story
 already
 considered
 is
 supplemented
 by
 the
 following
 And
 when
 the
 king
 came
 in
 to
 see
 the
 guests
 he
 saw
 there
 a
 man
 which
 had
 not
 on
 a
 wedding
 garment
 And
 he
 saith
 unto
 him
 Friend
 how
 camest
 thou
 in
 hither
 not
 having
 a
 wedding
 garment
 And
 he
 was
 speechless
 Then
 said
 the
 king
 to
 the
 servants
 Bind
 him
 hand
 and
 foot
 and
 take
 him
 away
 and
 cast
 him
 into
 outer
 darkness
 there
 shall
 be
 weeping
 and
 gnashing
 of
 teeth
 For
 many
 are
 called
 but
 few
 are
 chosen
 The
 lessons
 embodied
 in
 this
 section
 of
 the
 parable
 may
 be
 advantageously
 considered
 apart
 from
 those
 of
 the
 first
 division
 As
 was
 befitting
 his
 dignity
 the
 king
 came
 into
 the
 banquet
 hall
 after
 the
 guests
 had
 taken
 their
 places
 in
 orderly
 array
 His
 immediate
 detection
 of
 one
 who
 was
 without
 the
 prescribed
 garment
 implies
 a
 personal
 scrutiny
 of
 the
 guests
 One
 may
 be
 led
 to
 inquire
 how
 under
 the
 circumstances
 of
 hurried
 summoning
 the
 several
 guests
 could
 have
 suitably
 attired
 themselves
 for
 the
 feast
 The
 unity
 of
 the
 narrative
 requires
 that
 some
 provision
 had
 been
 made
 whereby
 each
 one
 who
 properly
 applied
 was
 given
 the
 garment
 prescribed
 by
 the
 kings
 command
 and
 in
 keeping
 with
 the
 established
 custom
 at
 court
 That
 the
 unrobed
 guest
 was
 guilty
 of
 neglect
 intentional
 disrespect
 or
 some
 more
 grievous
 offense
 is
 plain
 from
 the
 context
 The
 king
 at
 first
 was
 graciously
 considerate
 inquiring
 only
 as
 to
 how
 the
 man
 had
 entered
 without
 a
 wedding
 garment
 Had
 the
 guest
 been
 able
 to
 explain
 his
 exceptional
 appearance
 or
 had
 he
 any
 reasonable
 excuse
 to
 offer
 he
 surely
 would
 have
 spoken
 but
 we
 are
 told
 that
 he
 remained
 speechless
 The
 kings
 summons
 had
 been
 freely
 extended
 to
 all
 whom
 his
 servants
 had
 found
 but
 each
 of
 them
 had
 to
 enter
 the
 royal
 palace
 by
 the
 door
 and
 before
 reaching
 the
 banquet
 room
 in
 which
 the
 king
 would
 appear
 in
 person
 each
 would
 be
 properly
 attired
 but
 the
 deficient
 one
 by
 some
 means
 had
 entered
 by
 another
 way
 and
 not
 having
 passed
 the
 attendant
 sentinels
 at
 the
 portal
 he
 was
 an
 intruder
 of
 a
 kind
 with
 the
 man
 to
 whom
 the
 Lord
 had
 before
 referred
 as
 a
 thief
 and
 a
 robber
 because
 not
 entering
 by
 the
 door
 he
 had
 climbed
 up
 some
 other
 way
 The
 king
 gave
 a
 command
 and
 his
 ministers
 bound
 the
 offender
 and
 cast
 him
 forth
 from
 the
 palace
 into
 outer
 darkness
 where
 the
 anguish
 of
 remorse
 caused
 weeping
 and
 gnashing
 of
 teeth
 As
 summary
 and
 epilogue
 of
 the
 three
 great
 parables
 constituting
 this
 series
 the
 Lord
 spake
 these
 words
 of
 solemn
 import
 For
 many
 are
 called
 but
 few
 are
 chosen
 Each
 of
 the
 parables
 has
 its
 own
 wealth
 of
 wisdom
 and
 the
 three
 are
 as
 one
 in
 declaring
 the
 great
 truth
 that
 even
 the
 children
 of
 the
 covenant
 will
 be
 rejected
 except
 they
 make
 good
 their
 title
 by
 godly
 works
 while
 to
 the
 heathen
 and
 the
 sinners
 the
 portals
 of
 heaven
 shall
 open
 if
 by
 repentance
 and
 compliance
 with
 the
 laws
 and
 ordinances
 of
 the
 gospel
 they
 shall
 merit
 salvation
 The
 story
 of
 the
 royal
 marriage
 feast
 was
 the
 last
 of
 our
 Lords
 parables
 delivered
 publicly
 to
 a
 mixed
 audience
 Two
 others
 were
 spoken
 to
 the
 apostles
 as
 they
 sat
 in
 solemn
 converse
 with
 the
 Lord
 on
 the
 Mount
 of
 Olives
 after
 the
 public
 ministry
 of
 Christ
 had
 been
 brought
 to
 a
 close

 Its
 fruit

 highly

 article
 of
 food
 In
 the

 this
 is
 of
 three
 kinds
 
 the

 about
 the

 the

 are
 within

 The
 Two
 Sons
 in
 the
 ParableAlthough
 this
 excellent
 parable
 was
 addressed
 to
 the
 chief
 priests
 scribes
 and
 elders
 who
 had
 come
 in
 hostile
 spirit
 to
 demand
 of
 Christ
 the
 credentials
 of
 His
 authority
 its
 lesson
 is
 of
 universal
 application
 The
 two
 sons
 are
 yet
 alive
 in
 every
 human
 communitythe
 one
 openly
 boastful
 of
 his
 sin
 the
 other
 a
 hypocritical
 pretender
 Jesus
 did
 not
 commend
 the
 rough
 refusal
 of
 the
 first
 son
 of
 whom
 the
 father
 made
 a
 righteous
 demand
 for
 service
 it
 was
 his
 subsequent
 repentance
 attended
 by
 works
 that
 made
 him
 superior
 to
 his
 brother
 who
 had
 made
 fair
 promise
 but
 had
 kept
 it
 not
 There
 are
 many
 today
 who
 boast
 that
 they
 make
 no
 profession
 of
 religion
 nor
 pretense
 of
 godly
 life
 Their
 frankness
 will
 not
 mitigate
 their
 sins
 it
 simply
 shows
 that
 a
 certain
 species
 of
 hypocrisy
 is
 not
 prominent
 among
 their
 numerous
 offenses
 but
 that
 a
 man
 is
 innocent
 of
 one
 vice
 say
 that
 of
 drunkenness
 in
 no
 wise
 diminishes
 his
 measure
 of
 guilt
 if
 he
 be
 a
 liar
 a
 thief
 an
 adulterer
 or
 a
 murderer
 Both
 the
 sons
 in
 the
 parable
 were
 grievous
 sinners
 but
 the
 one
 turned
 from
 his
 evil
 ways
 which
 theretofore
 he
 had
 followed
 with
 flagrant
 openness
 while
 the
 other
 continued
 in
 dark
 deeds
 of
 sin
 which
 he
 sought
 to
 cover
 by
 a
 cloak
 of
 hypocrisy
 Let
 no
 man
 think
 that
 because
 he
 becomes
 intoxicated
 at
 the
 public
 bar
 he
 is
 any
 the
 less
 a
 drunkard
 than
 is
 he
 who
 swallows
 the
 beverage
 of
 hell
 in
 comparative
 privacy
 though
 the
 latter
 be
 both
 drunkard
 and
 hypocrite
 For
 these
 sins
 as
 for
 all
 others
 genuine
 repentance
 is
 the
 only
 saving
 antidote
 
 Israel
 Symbolized
 by
 Vineyard
 and
 VinesThe
 aptness
 of
 our
 Lords
 representation
 of
 Israel
 as
 a
 vineyard
 could
 not
 have
 escaped
 the
 perception
 of
 the
 Jews
 to
 whom
 Old
 Testament
 similes
 of
 analogous
 form
 were
 familiar
 figures
 Notable
 among
 others
 is
 the
 striking
 picture
 presented
 by
 Isaiah
 
 in
 which
 the
 well
 provided
 vineyard
 is
 shown
 as
 producing
 wild
 grapes
 only
 for
 which
 grievous
 disappointment
 of
 his
 expectations
 the
 owner
 determined
 to
 break
 down
 the
 wall
 remove
 the
 hedge
 and
 leave
 the
 vineyard
 to
 its
 fate
 of
 abandonment
 The
 explication
 of
 the
 parable
 voiced
 by
 Isaiah
 is
 thus
 given
 For
 the
 vineyard
 of
 the
 Lord
 of
 hosts
 is
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 and
 the
 men
 of
 Judah
 his
 pleasant
 plant
 and
 he
 looked
 for
 judgment
 but
 behold
 oppression
 for
 righteousness
 but
 behold
 a
 cry
 The
 worthlessness
 of
 a
 vine
 save
 only
 for
 its
 fruit
 was
 set
 forth
 by
 the
 Lord
 through
 His
 prophet
 Ezekiel
 
 and
 truly
 it
 is
 so
 that
 the
 wood
 of
 the
 grape
 plant
 is
 fit
 for
 nothing
 but
 burning
 the
 whole
 vine
 as
 wood
 is
 inferior
 to
 a
 branch
 from
 a
 forest
 tree
 verse
 
 And
 Israel
 is
 represented
 as
 such
 a
 vine
 precious
 if
 but
 fruitful
 otherwise
 nothing
 but
 fuel
 and
 that
 of
 poor
 quality
 The
 psalmist
 sang
 of
 the
 vine
 that
 Jehovah
 had
 brought
 out
 of
 Egypt
 and
 which
 planted
 with
 care
 and
 hedged
 about
 had
 flourished
 even
 with
 goodly
 boughs
 but
 the
 favor
 of
 the
 Lord
 had
 been
 turned
 from
 the
 vine
 and
 it
 had
 been
 left
 desolate

 The
 Call
 to
 the
 Marriage
 FeastThe
 calling
 of
 the
 guests
 who
 had
 been
 bidden
 aforetime
 is
 thus
 commented
 upon
 by
 Trench
 Parables
 pp
 
 This
 summoning
 of
 those
 already
 bidden
 was
 and
 as
 modern
 travellers
 attest
 is
 still
 quite
 in
 accordance
 with
 Eastern
 manners
 Thus
 Esther
 invites
 Haman
 to
 a
 banquet
 on
 the
 morrow
 Esth
 
 and
 when
 the
 time
 has
 actually
 arrived
 the
 chamberlain
 comes
 to
 usher
 him
 to
 the
 banquet
 
 There
 is
 therefore
 no
 slightest
 reason
 why
 we
 should
 make
 them
 that
 were
 bidden
 to
 mean
 them
 that
 were
 now
 to
 be
 bidden
 such
 an
 interpretation
 not
 merely
 violating
 all
 laws
 of
 grammar
 but
 the
 higher
 purpose
 with
 which
 the
 parable
 was
 spoken
 for
 our
 Lord
 assuming
 that
 the
 guests
 had
 been
 invited
 long
 ago
 does
 thus
 remind
 His
 hearers
 that
 what
 He
 brought
 if
 in
 one
 sense
 new
 was
 in
 another
 a
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 old
 that
 He
 claimed
 to
 be
 heard
 not
 as
 one
 suddenly
 starting
 up
 unconnected
 with
 aught
 which
 had
 gone
 before
 but
 as
 Himself
 the
 end
 of
 the
 law
 to
 which
 it
 had
 been
 ever
 tending
 the
 birth
 with
 which
 the
 whole
 Jewish
 dispensation
 had
 been
 pregnant
 and
 which
 alone
 should
 give
 a
 meaning
 to
 it
 all
 In
 His
 words
 them
 that
 were
 bidden
 is
 involved
 the
 fact
 that
 there
 was
 nothing
 abrupt
 in
 the
 coming
 of
 His
 kingdom
 that
 its
 rudiments
 had
 a
 long
 while
 before
 been
 laid
 that
 all
 to
 which
 His
 adversaries
 clung
 as
 precious
 in
 their
 past
 history
 was
 prophetic
 of
 blessings
 now
 actually
 present
 to
 them
 in
 Him
 The
 original
 invitation
 which
 had
 now
 come
 to
 maturity
 reached
 back
 to
 the
 foundation
 of
 the
 Jewish
 commonwealth
 was
 taken
 up
 and
 repeated
 by
 each
 succeeding
 prophet
 as
 he
 prophesied
 of
 the
 crowning
 grace
 that
 should
 one
 day
 be
 brought
 to
 Israel
 Luke
 
 
 Pet
 
 and
 summoned
 the
 people
 to
 hold
 themselves
 in
 a
 spiritual
 readiness
 to
 welcome
 their
 Lord
 and
 their
 King
 
 Servants
 and
 MinistersAccording
 to
 good
 philological
 authority
 ministers
 or
 ministering
 attendants
 is
 a
 more
 literal
 rendering
 of
 the
 original
 than
 servants
 in
 Matt
 
 In
 the
 earlier
 verses
 
 
 
 
 
 of
 the
 same
 chapter
 servants
 or
 servitors
 best
 expresses
 the
 meaning
 of
 the
 original
 The
 distinction
 is
 significant
 as
 it
 implies
 an
 important
 difference
 of
 station
 between
 the
 servants
 who
 were
 sent
 out
 to
 bid
 the
 people
 to
 the
 feast
 and
 the
 ministers
 in
 immediate
 attendance
 upon
 the
 king
 The
 first
 are
 typical
 of
 Gods
 servants
 who
 proclaim
 His
 word
 in
 the
 world
 the
 latter
 symbolize
 the
 angels
 who
 shall
 execute
 His
 judgments
 on
 the
 wicked
 by
 gathering
 out
 from
 His
 kingdom
 all
 things
 that
 offend

 The
 Called
 and
 the
 ChosenEdersheims
 reflections
 upon
 this
 subject
 follow
 in
 part
 vol

 pp
 
 
 The
 King
 entered
 to
 see
 His
 guests
 and
 among
 them
 he
 descried
 one
 who
 had
 not
 on
 a
 wedding
 garment
 As
 the
 guests
 had
 been
 travelers
 and
 as
 the
 feast
 was
 in
 the
 Kings
 palace
 we
 cannot
 be
 mistaken
 in
 supposing
 that
 such
 garments
 were
 supplied
 in
 the
 palace
 to
 all
 who
 sought
 them
 And
 with
 this
 agrees
 the
 circumstance
 that
 the
 man
 so
 addressed
 was
 speechless
 His
 conduct
 argued
 utter
 insensibility
 as
 regarded
 that
 to
 which
 he
 had
 been
 calledignorance
 of
 what
 was
 due
 the
 King
 and
 what
 became
 such
 a
 feast
 For
 although
 no
 previous
 state
 of
 preparedness
 was
 required
 of
 the
 invited
 guests
 all
 being
 bidden
 whether
 good
 or
 bad
 yet
 the
 fact
 remained
 that
 if
 they
 were
 to
 take
 part
 in
 the
 feast
 they
 must
 put
 on
 a
 garment
 suited
 to
 the
 occasion
 All
 are
 invited
 to
 the
 gospel
 feast
 but
 they
 who
 will
 partake
 of
 it
 must
 put
 on
 the
 Kings
 wedding
 garment
 of
 evangelical
 holiness
 And
 whereas
 it
 is
 said
 in
 the
 parable
 that
 only
 one
 was
 descried
 without
 this
 garment
 this
 is
 intended
 to
 teach
 that
 the
 King
 will
 not
 only
 generally
 view
 His
 guests
 but
 that
 each
 will
 be
 separately
 examined
 and
 that
 no
 oneno
 not
 a
 single
 individualwill
 be
 able
 to
 escape
 discovery
 amidst
 the
 mass
 of
 guests
 if
 he
 has
 not
 the
 wedding
 garment
 In
 short
 in
 that
 day
 of
 trial
 it
 is
 not
 a
 scrutiny
 of
 churches
 but
 of
 individuals
 in
 the
 Church
 The
 call
 comes
 to
 all
 but
 it
 may
 be
 outwardly
 accepted
 and
 a
 man
 may
 sit
 down
 to
 the
 feast
 and
 yet
 he
 may
 not
 be
 chosen
 to
 partake
 of
 the
 feast
 because
 he
 has
 not
 the
 wedding
 garment
 of
 converting
 sanctifying
 grace
 And
 so
 one
 may
 be
 thrust
 even
 from
 the
 marriage
 board
 into
 the
 darkness
 without
 with
 its
 sorrow
 and
 anguish
 Thus
 side
 by
 side
 yet
 wide
 apart
 are
 these
 twoGods
 call
 and
 Gods
 choice
 The
 connecting
 link
 between
 them
 is
 the
 wedding
 garment
 freely
 given
 in
 the
 Palace
 Yet
 we
 must
 seek
 it
 ask
 it
 put
 it
 on
 And
 as
 here
 also
 we
 have
 side
 by
 side
 Gods
 gift
 and
 mans
 activity
 And
 still
 to
 all
 time
 and
 to
 all
 men
 alike
 in
 its
 warning
 teaching
 and
 blessing
 is
 it
 true
 Many
 are
 called
 but
 few
 chosen
 Many
 words
 of
 related
 meaning
 both
 Hebrew
 and
 Greek
 are
 translated
 garment
 in
 our
 English
 Bible
 The
 Greek
 original
 in
 the
 mention
 of
 the
 wedding
 garment
 is
 enduma
 this
 does
 not
 occur
 in
 other
 Bible
 passages
 as
 the
 original
 of
 garment
 The
 noun
 is
 related
 to
 the
 Greek
 verb
 enduein
 to
 put
 on
 as
 a
 garment
 Compare
 Luke
 
 until
 ye
 be
 endued

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 CLOSE
 OF
 OUR
 LORDS
 PUBLIC
 MINISTRY
 A
 CONSPIRACY
 OF
 PHARISEES
 AND
 HERODIANS
 The
 Jewish
 authorities
 continued
 unceasingly
 active
 in
 their
 determined
 efforts
 to
 tempt
 or
 beguile
 Jesus
 into
 some
 act
 or
 utterance
 on
 which
 they
 could
 base
 a
 charge
 of
 offense
 under
 either
 their
 own
 or
 Roman
 law
 The
 Pharisees
 counseled
 together
 as
 to
 how
 they
 might
 entangle
 him
 in
 his
 talk
 and
 then
 laying
 aside
 their
 partisan
 prejudices
 they
 conspired
 to
 this
 end
 with
 the
 Herodians
 a
 political
 faction
 whose
 chief
 characteristic
 was
 the
 purpose
 of
 maintaining
 in
 power
 the
 family
 of
 the
 Herods
 which
 policy
 of
 necessity
 entailed
 the
 upholding
 of
 the
 Roman
 power
 upon
 which
 the
 Herods
 depended
 for
 their
 delegated
 authority
 The
 same
 incongruous
 association
 had
 been
 entered
 into
 before
 in
 an
 attempt
 to
 provoke
 Jesus
 to
 overt
 speech
 or
 action
 in
 Galilee
 and
 the
 Lord
 had
 coupled
 the
 parties
 together
 in
 His
 warning
 to
 the
 disciples
 to
 beware
 of
 the
 leaven
 of
 both
 So
 on
 the
 last
 day
 of
 our
 Lords
 teaching
 in
 public
 Pharisees
 and
 Herodians
 joined
 forces
 against
 Him
 the
 one
 watchful
 for
 the
 smallest
 technical
 infringement
 of
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 the
 other
 alert
 to
 seize
 upon
 the
 slightest
 excuse
 for
 charging
 Him
 with
 disloyalty
 to
 the
 secular
 powers
 Their
 plans
 were
 conceived
 in
 treachery
 and
 put
 into
 operation
 as
 the
 living
 embodiment
 of
 a
 lie
 Choosing
 some
 of
 their
 number
 who
 had
 not
 before
 appeared
 in
 personal
 antagonism
 to
 Jesus
 and
 who
 were
 supposed
 to
 be
 unknown
 to
 Him
 the
 chief
 conspirators
 sent
 these
 with
 instructions
 to
 feign
 themselves
 just
 men
 that
 they
 might
 take
 hold
 of
 his
 words
 that
 so
 they
 might
 deliver
 him
 unto
 the
 power
 and
 authority
 of
 the
 governor
 This
 delegation
 of
 hypocritical
 spies
 came
 asking
 a
 question
 in
 pretended
 sincerity
 as
 though
 they
 were
 troubled
 in
 conscience
 and
 desired
 counsel
 of
 the
 eminent
 Teacher
 Master
 said
 they
 with
 fawning
 duplicity
 we
 know
 that
 thou
 art
 true
 and
 teachest
 the
 way
 of
 God
 in
 truth
 neither
 carest
 thou
 for
 any
 man
 for
 thou
 regardest
 not
 the
 person
 of
 men
 This
 studied
 tribute
 to
 our
 Lords
 courage
 and
 independence
 of
 thought
 and
 action
 was
 truthful
 in
 every
 word
 but
 as
 uttered
 by
 those
 fulsome
 dissemblers
 and
 in
 their
 nefarious
 intent
 it
 was
 egregiously
 false
 The
 honeyed
 address
 however
 by
 which
 the
 conspirators
 attempted
 to
 cajole
 the
 Lord
 into
 unwariness
 indicated
 that
 the
 question
 they
 were
 about
 to
 submit
 was
 one
 requiring
 for
 its
 proper
 answer
 just
 such
 qualities
 of
 mind
 as
 they
 pretendingly
 attributed
 to
 Him
 Tell
 us
 therefore
 they
 continued
 What
 thinkest
 thou
 Is
 it
 lawful
 to
 give
 tribute
 unto
 Csar
 or
 not
 The
 question
 had
 been
 chosen
 with
 diabolic
 craft
 for
 of
 all
 acts
 attesting
 compulsory
 allegiance
 to
 Rome
 that
 of
 having
 to
 pay
 the
 polltax
 was
 most
 offensive
 to
 the
 Jews
 Had
 Jesus
 answered
 Yes
 the
 guileful
 Pharisees
 might
 have
 inflamed
 the
 multitude
 against
 Him
 as
 a
 disloyal
 son
 of
 Abraham
 had
 His
 answer
 been
 No
 the
 scheming
 Herodians
 could
 have
 denounced
 Him
 as
 a
 promoter
 of
 sedition
 against
 the
 Roman
 government
 Moreover
 the
 question
 was
 unnecessary
 the
 nation
 both
 rulers
 and
 people
 had
 settled
 it
 however
 grudgingly
 for
 they
 accepted
 and
 circulated
 among
 themselves
 the
 Roman
 coinage
 as
 a
 common
 medium
 of
 exchange
 and
 it
 was
 a
 criterion
 of
 recognition
 among
 the
 Jews
 that
 to
 make
 current
 the
 coins
 of
 any
 sovereign
 was
 to
 acknowledge
 his
 royal
 authority
 But
 Jesus
 perceived
 their
 wickedness
 and
 said
 Why
 tempt
 ye
 me
 ye
 hypocrites
 All
 their
 artful
 expressions
 of
 false
 adulation
 were
 countered
 by
 the
 withering
 epithet
 hypocrites
 Shew
 me
 the
 tribute
 money
 He
 commanded
 and
 they
 produced
 a
 pennya
 Roman
 denarius
 bearing
 the
 effigy
 and
 name
 of
 Tiberius
 Csar
 emperor
 of
 Rome
 Whose
 is
 this
 image
 and
 superscription
 He
 asked
 They
 answered
 Csars
 Then
 saith
 he
 unto
 them
 Render
 therefore
 unto
 Csar
 the
 things
 which
 are
 Csars
 and
 unto
 God
 the
 things
 that
 are
 Gods
 The
 reply
 was
 a
 masterly
 one
 by
 whatever
 standard
 we
 gage
 it
 it
 has
 become
 an
 aphorism
 in
 literature
 and
 life
 It
 swept
 away
 any
 lingering
 thought
 or
 expectation
 that
 in
 the
 mind
 of
 Him
 who
 had
 so
 recently
 ridden
 into
 Jerusalem
 as
 King
 of
 Israel
 and
 Prince
 of
 Peace
 there
 was
 even
 the
 semblance
 of
 aspiration
 for
 earthly
 power
 or
 dominion
 It
 established
 for
 all
 time
 the
 one
 righteous
 basis
 of
 relationship
 between
 spiritual
 and
 secular
 duties
 between
 church
 and
 state
 The
 apostles
 in
 later
 years
 builded
 upon
 this
 foundation
 and
 enjoined
 obedience
 to
 the
 laws
 of
 established
 governments
 One
 may
 draw
 a
 lesson
 if
 he
 will
 from
 the
 association
 of
 our
 Lords
 words
 with
 the
 occurrence
 of
 Csars
 image
 on
 the
 coin
 It
 was
 that
 effigy
 with
 its
 accompanying
 superscription
 that
 gave
 special
 point
 to
 His
 memorable
 instruction
 Render
 therefore
 unto
 Csar
 the
 things
 which
 are
 Csars
 This
 was
 followed
 by
 the
 further
 injunction
 and
 unto
 God
 the
 things
 that
 are
 Gods
 Every
 human
 soul
 is
 stamped
 with
 the
 image
 and
 superscription
 of
 God
 however
 blurred
 and
 indistinct
 the
 lines
 may
 have
 become
 through
 the
 corrosion
 or
 attrition
 of
 sin
 and
 as
 unto
 Csar
 should
 be
 rendered
 the
 coins
 upon
 which
 his
 effigy
 appeared
 so
 unto
 God
 should
 be
 given
 the
 souls
 that
 bear
 His
 image
 Render
 unto
 the
 world
 the
 stamped
 pieces
 that
 are
 made
 legally
 current
 by
 the
 insignia
 of
 worldly
 powers
 and
 give
 unto
 God
 and
 His
 service
 yourselvesthe
 divine
 mintage
 of
 His
 eternal
 realm
 Pharisees
 and
 Herodians
 were
 silenced
 by
 the
 unanswerable
 wisdom
 of
 the
 Lords
 reply
 to
 their
 crafty
 question
 Try
 as
 they
 would
 they
 could
 not
 take
 hold
 of
 his
 words
 and
 they
 were
 put
 to
 shame
 before
 the
 people
 who
 were
 witnesses
 to
 their
 humiliation
 Marveling
 at
 His
 answer
 and
 unwilling
 to
 take
 the
 chance
 of
 further
 and
 possibly
 greater
 embarrassment
 they
 left
 him
 and
 went
 their
 way
 Nevertheless
 these
 perverted
 Jews
 persisted
 in
 their
 base
 and
 treacherous
 purpose
 as
 appears
 nowhere
 more
 glaringly
 evident
 than
 in
 their
 utterly
 false
 accusation
 before
 Pilatethat
 Jesus
 was
 guilty
 of
 forbidding
 to
 give
 tribute
 to
 Csar
 saying
 that
 he
 himself
 is
 Christ
 a
 King
 SADDUCEES
 QUESTION
 ABOUT
 THE
 RESURRECTION
 Next
 the
 Sadducees
 tried
 to
 discomfit
 Jesus
 by
 propounding
 what
 they
 regarded
 as
 an
 involved
 if
 not
 indeed
 a
 very
 difficult
 question
 The
 Sadducees
 held
 that
 there
 could
 be
 no
 bodily
 resurrection
 on
 which
 point
 of
 doctrine
 as
 on
 many
 others
 they
 were
 the
 avowed
 opponents
 of
 the
 Pharisees
 The
 question
 submitted
 by
 the
 Sadducees
 on
 this
 occasion
 related
 directly
 to
 the
 resurrection
 and
 was
 framed
 to
 discredit
 the
 doctrine
 by
 a
 most
 unfavorable
 and
 grossly
 exaggerated
 application
 thereof
 Master
 said
 the
 spokesman
 of
 the
 party
 Moses
 said
 If
 a
 man
 die
 having
 no
 children
 his
 brother
 shall
 marry
 his
 wife
 and
 raise
 up
 seed
 unto
 his
 brother
 Now
 there
 were
 with
 us
 seven
 brethren
 and
 the
 first
 when
 he
 had
 married
 a
 wife
 deceased
 and
 having
 no
 issue
 left
 his
 wife
 unto
 his
 brother
 Likewise
 the
 second
 also
 and
 the
 third
 unto
 the
 seventh
 And
 last
 of
 all
 the
 woman
 died
 also
 Therefore
 in
 the
 resurrection
 whose
 wife
 shall
 she
 be
 of
 the
 seven
 for
 they
 all
 had
 her
 It
 was
 beyond
 question
 that
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 authorized
 and
 required
 that
 the
 living
 brother
 of
 a
 deceased
 and
 childless
 husband
 should
 marry
 the
 widow
 with
 the
 purpose
 of
 rearing
 children
 to
 the
 name
 of
 the
 dead
 whose
 family
 lineage
 would
 thus
 be
 legally
 continued
 Such
 a
 state
 of
 affairs
 as
 that
 presented
 by
 the
 casuistical
 Sadducees
 in
 which
 seven
 brothers
 in
 succession
 had
 as
 wife
 and
 left
 as
 childless
 widow
 the
 same
 woman
 was
 possible
 under
 the
 Mosaic
 code
 relating
 to
 levirate
 marriages
 but
 it
 was
 a
 most
 improbable
 instance
 Jesus
 stopped
 not
 however
 to
 question
 the
 elements
 of
 the
 problem
 as
 presented
 to
 Him
 whether
 the
 case
 was
 assumed
 or
 real
 mattered
 not
 since
 the
 question
 Whose
 wife
 shall
 she
 be
 was
 based
 on
 an
 utterly
 erroneous
 conception
 Jesus
 answered
 and
 said
 unto
 them
 Ye
 do
 err
 not
 knowing
 the
 scriptures
 nor
 the
 power
 of
 God
 For
 in
 the
 resurrection
 they
 neither
 marry
 nor
 are
 given
 in
 marriage
 but
 are
 as
 the
 angels
 of
 God
 in
 heaven
 The
 Lords
 meaning
 was
 clear
 that
 in
 the
 resurrected
 state
 there
 can
 be
 no
 question
 among
 the
 seven
 brothers
 as
 to
 whose
 wife
 for
 eternity
 the
 woman
 shall
 be
 since
 all
 except
 the
 first
 had
 married
 her
 for
 the
 duration
 of
 mortal
 life
 only
 and
 primarily
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 perpetuating
 in
 mortality
 the
 name
 and
 family
 of
 the
 brother
 who
 first
 died
 Luke
 records
 the
 Lords
 words
 as
 follows
 in
 part
 But
 they
 which
 shall
 be
 accounted
 worthy
 to
 obtain
 that
 world
 and
 the
 resurrection
 from
 the
 dead
 neither
 marry
 nor
 are
 given
 in
 marriage
 Neither
 can
 they
 die
 any
 more
 for
 they
 are
 equal
 unto
 the
 angels
 and
 are
 the
 children
 of
 God
 being
 the
 children
 of
 the
 resurrection
 In
 the
 resurrection
 there
 will
 be
 no
 marrying
 nor
 giving
 in
 marriage
 for
 all
 questions
 of
 marital
 status
 must
 be
 settled
 before
 that
 time
 under
 the
 authority
 of
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 which
 holds
 the
 power
 to
 seal
 in
 marriage
 for
 both
 time
 and
 eternity
 From
 the
 case
 presented
 by
 His
 treacherous
 questioners
 Jesus
 turned
 to
 the
 actuality
 of
 the
 resurrection
 which
 was
 involved
 in
 and
 implied
 by
 the
 inquiry
 But
 as
 touching
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 dead
 said
 He
 have
 ye
 not
 read
 that
 which
 was
 spoken
 unto
 you
 by
 God
 saying
 I
 am
 the
 God
 of
 Abraham
 and
 the
 God
 of
 Isaac
 and
 the
 God
 of
 Jacob
 God
 is
 not
 the
 God
 of
 the
 dead
 but
 of
 the
 living
 This
 was
 a
 direct
 assault
 upon
 the
 Sadducean
 doctrine
 of
 negation
 concerning
 the
 literal
 resurrection
 of
 the
 dead
 The
 Sadducees
 were
 distinctively
 the
 zealous
 upholders
 of
 the
 law
 wherein
 Jehovah
 affirms
 Himself
 to
 be
 the
 God
 of
 Abraham
 Isaac
 and
 Jacob
 yet
 they
 denied
 the
 possible
 resurrection
 of
 these
 patriarchs
 and
 made
 the
 exalted
 title
 under
 which
 the
 Lord
 had
 revealed
 Himself
 to
 Moses
 valid
 only
 during
 the
 brief
 mortal
 existence
 of
 the
 progenitors
 of
 the
 Israelitish
 nation
 The
 declaration
 that
 Jehovah
 is
 not
 the
 God
 of
 the
 dead
 but
 of
 the
 living
 was
 an
 unanswerable
 denunciation
 of
 the
 Sadducean
 perversion
 of
 scripture
 and
 with
 solemn
 finality
 the
 Lord
 added
 Ye
 therefore
 do
 greatly
 err
 Certain
 of
 the
 scribes
 present
 were
 impressed
 by
 the
 incontrovertible
 demonstration
 of
 the
 truth
 and
 exclaimed
 with
 approbation
 Master
 thou
 hast
 well
 said
 The
 proud
 Sadducees
 were
 confuted
 and
 silenced
 and
 after
 that
 they
 durst
 not
 ask
 him
 any
 question
 at
 all
 THE
 GREAT
 COMMANDMENT
 The
 Pharisees
 covertly
 rejoicing
 over
 the
 discomfiture
 of
 their
 rivals
 now
 summoned
 courage
 enough
 to
 plan
 another
 attack
 of
 their
 own
 One
 of
 their
 number
 a
 lawyer
 by
 which
 title
 we
 may
 understand
 one
 of
 the
 scribes
 who
 was
 distinctively
 also
 a
 professor
 of
 ecclesiastical
 law
 asked
 Which
 is
 the
 first
 commandment
 of
 all
 or
 as
 Matthew
 states
 the
 question
 Master
 which
 is
 the
 great
 commandment
 in
 the
 law
 The
 reply
 was
 prompt
 incisive
 and
 so
 comprehensive
 as
 to
 cover
 the
 requirements
 of
 the
 law
 in
 their
 entirety
 With
 the
 imperative
 call
 to
 attention
 with
 which
 Moses
 had
 summoned
 Israel
 to
 hear
 and
 heed
 the
 very
 words
 of
 which
 were
 written
 on
 the
 phylacteries
 which
 the
 Pharisees
 wore
 as
 frontlets
 between
 their
 eyes
 Jesus
 answered
 Hear
 O
 Israel
 The
 Lord
 our
 God
 is
 one
 Lord
 And
 thou
 shalt
 love
 the
 Lord
 thy
 God
 with
 all
 thy
 heart
 and
 with
 all
 thy
 soul
 and
 with
 all
 thy
 mind
 and
 with
 all
 thy
 strength
 this
 is
 the
 first
 commandment
 And
 the
 second
 is
 like
 namely
 this
 Thou
 shalt
 love
 thy
 neighbour
 as
 thyself
 There
 is
 none
 other
 commandment
 greater
 than
 these
 Matthews
 wording
 of
 the
 concluding
 declaration
 is
 On
 these
 two
 commandments
 hang
 all
 the
 law
 and
 the
 prophets
 The
 philosophic
 soundness
 of
 the
 Lords
 profound
 generalization
 and
 comprehensive
 summarizing
 of
 the
 law
 and
 the
 prophets
 will
 appeal
 to
 all
 students
 of
 human
 nature
 It
 is
 a
 common
 tendency
 of
 man
 to
 reach
 after
 or
 at
 least
 to
 inquire
 after
 and
 marvel
 about
 the
 superlative
 Who
 is
 the
 greatest
 poet
 philosopher
 scientist
 preacher
 or
 statesman
 Who
 stands
 first
 and
 foremost
 in
 the
 community
 the
 nation
 or
 even
 as
 the
 apostles
 in
 their
 aspiring
 ignorance
 asked
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 Which
 mountain
 overtops
 all
 the
 rest
 Which
 river
 is
 the
 longest
 or
 the
 largest
 Such
 queries
 are
 ever
 current
 The
 Jews
 had
 divided
 and
 subdivided
 the
 commandments
 of
 the
 law
 and
 had
 supplemented
 even
 the
 minutest
 subdivision
 with
 rules
 of
 their
 own
 contriving
 Now
 came
 the
 Pharisee
 asking
 which
 of
 all
 these
 requirements
 was
 the
 greatest
 To
 love
 God
 with
 all
 ones
 heart
 and
 soul
 and
 mind
 is
 to
 serve
 Him
 and
 keep
 all
 His
 commandments
 To
 love
 ones
 neighbor
 as
 ones
 self
 is
 to
 be
 a
 brother
 in
 the
 broadest
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 the
 most
 exacting
 sense
 of
 the
 term
 Therefore
 the
 commandment
 to
 love
 God
 and
 man
 is
 the
 greatest
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 the
 simple
 and
 mathematical
 truth
 that
 the
 whole
 is
 greater
 than
 any
 part
 What
 need
 of
 the
 decalog
 could
 there
 be
 if
 mankind
 would
 obey
 this
 first
 and
 great
 and
 allembracing
 commandment
 The
 Lords
 reply
 to
 the
 question
 was
 convincing
 even
 to
 the
 learned
 scribe
 who
 had
 acted
 as
 spokesman
 for
 his
 Pharisaic
 colleagues
 The
 man
 was
 honest
 enough
 to
 admit
 the
 righteousness
 and
 wisdom
 on
 which
 the
 reply
 was
 grounded
 and
 impulsively
 he
 voiced
 acceptance
 saying
 Well
 Master
 thou
 hast
 said
 the
 truth
 for
 there
 is
 one
 God
 and
 there
 is
 none
 other
 but
 he
 And
 to
 love
 him
 with
 all
 the
 heart
 and
 with
 all
 the
 understanding
 and
 with
 all
 the
 soul
 and
 with
 all
 the
 strength
 and
 to
 love
 his
 neighbour
 as
 himself
 is
 more
 than
 all
 whole
 burnt
 offerings
 and
 sacrifices
 Jesus
 was
 no
 whit
 less
 prompt
 than
 the
 wellintending
 scribe
 in
 acknowledging
 merit
 in
 the
 words
 of
 an
 opponent
 and
 to
 the
 man
 He
 gave
 the
 encouraging
 assurance
 Thou
 art
 not
 far
 from
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 As
 to
 whether
 the
 scribe
 remained
 firm
 in
 purpose
 and
 eventually
 gained
 entrance
 into
 that
 blessed
 abode
 the
 scriptural
 record
 is
 silent
 JESUS
 TURNS
 QUESTIONER
 Sadducees
 Herodians
 Pharisees
 lawyers
 and
 scribes
 all
 had
 in
 turn
 met
 discomfiture
 and
 defeat
 in
 their
 efforts
 to
 entangle
 Jesus
 on
 questions
 of
 doctrine
 or
 practise
 and
 had
 utterly
 failed
 to
 incite
 Him
 to
 any
 act
 or
 utterance
 on
 which
 they
 could
 lawfully
 charge
 Him
 with
 offense
 Having
 so
 effectually
 silenced
 all
 who
 had
 ventured
 to
 challenge
 Him
 to
 debate
 either
 covertly
 or
 with
 open
 intent
 that
 no
 man
 after
 that
 durst
 ask
 him
 any
 question
 Jesus
 in
 turn
 became
 the
 aggressive
 interrogator
 Turning
 to
 the
 Pharisees
 who
 had
 clustered
 together
 for
 greater
 facility
 in
 consultation
 Jesus
 began
 a
 colloquy
 which
 proceeded
 as
 follows
 What
 think
 ye
 of
 Christ
 whose
 son
 is
 he
 They
 say
 unto
 him
 The
 son
 of
 David
 He
 saith
 unto
 them
 How
 then
 doth
 David
 in
 spirit
 call
 him
 Lord
 saying
 The
 Lord
 said
 unto
 my
 Lord
 Sit
 thou
 on
 my
 right
 hand
 till
 I
 make
 thine
 enemies
 thy
 footstool
 If
 David
 then
 call
 him
 Lord
 how
 is
 he
 his
 son
 The
 Lords
 citation
 of
 Davids
 jubilant
 and
 worshipful
 song
 of
 praise
 which
 as
 Mark
 avers
 Jesus
 said
 was
 inspired
 by
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 had
 reference
 to
 the
 Messianic
 psalm
 in
 which
 the
 royal
 singer
 affirmed
 his
 own
 reverent
 allegiance
 and
 extolled
 the
 glorious
 reign
 of
 the
 promised
 King
 of
 kings
 who
 is
 specifically
 called
 therein
 a
 priest
 forever
 after
 the
 order
 of
 Melchizedek
 Puzzling
 as
 was
 the
 unexpected
 question
 to
 the
 erudite
 Jews
 we
 fail
 to
 perceive
 in
 it
 any
 inexplicable
 difficulty
 since
 to
 us
 less
 prejudiced
 than
 they
 who
 lived
 in
 expectation
 of
 a
 Messiah
 who
 would
 be
 Davids
 son
 only
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 family
 descent
 and
 royal
 succession
 in
 the
 splendor
 of
 temporal
 rule
 the
 eternal
 Godship
 of
 the
 Messiah
 is
 a
 fact
 demonstrated
 and
 undeniable
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 is
 the
 Son
 of
 David
 in
 the
 physical
 way
 of
 lineage
 by
 which
 both
 Jesus
 and
 David
 are
 sons
 of
 Jacob
 Isaac
 Abraham
 and
 Adam
 But
 while
 Jesus
 was
 born
 in
 the
 flesh
 as
 late
 in
 the
 centuries
 as
 the
 meridian
 of
 time
 He
 was
 Jehovah
 Lord
 and
 God
 before
 David
 Abraham
 or
 Adam
 was
 known
 on
 earth
 WICKED
 SCRIBES
 AND
 PHARISEES
 DENOUNCED
 The
 humiliating
 defeat
 of
 the
 Pharisaic
 party
 was
 made
 all
 the
 more
 memorable
 and
 bitter
 by
 the
 Lords
 final
 denunciation
 of
 the
 system
 and
 His
 condemnation
 of
 its
 unworthy
 representatives
 Addressing
 Himself
 primarily
 to
 the
 disciples
 yet
 speaking
 in
 the
 hearing
 of
 the
 multitude
 He
 directed
 the
 attention
 of
 all
 to
 the
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 who
 He
 pointed
 out
 occupied
 the
 seat
 of
 Moses
 as
 doctrinal
 expounders
 and
 official
 administrators
 of
 the
 law
 and
 who
 were
 therefore
 to
 be
 obeyed
 in
 their
 authoritative
 rule
 but
 against
 their
 pernicious
 example
 the
 disciples
 were
 forcefully
 warned
 All
 therefore
 whatsoever
 they
 bid
 you
 observe
 that
 observe
 and
 do
 said
 the
 Lord
 but
 do
 not
 ye
 after
 their
 works
 for
 they
 say
 and
 do
 not
 Distinction
 between
 due
 observance
 of
 official
 precept
 and
 the
 personal
 responsibility
 of
 following
 evil
 example
 though
 it
 be
 that
 of
 men
 high
 in
 authority
 could
 not
 have
 been
 made
 plainer
 Disobedience
 to
 law
 was
 not
 to
 be
 excused
 because
 of
 corruption
 among
 the
 laws
 representatives
 nor
 was
 wickedness
 in
 any
 individual
 to
 be
 condoned
 or
 palliated
 because
 of
 anothers
 villainy
 In
 explanation
 of
 the
 caution
 He
 so
 openly
 blazoned
 against
 the
 vices
 of
 the
 rulers
 the
 Lord
 continued
 For
 they
 bind
 heavy
 burdens
 and
 grievous
 to
 be
 borne
 and
 lay
 them
 on
 mens
 shoulders
 but
 they
 themselves
 will
 not
 move
 them
 with
 one
 of
 their
 fingers
 Rabbinism
 had
 practically
 superseded
 the
 law
 in
 the
 substitution
 of
 multitudinous
 rules
 and
 exactions
 with
 conditional
 penalties
 the
 day
 was
 filled
 with
 traditional
 observances
 by
 which
 even
 the
 trivial
 affairs
 of
 life
 were
 encumbered
 yet
 from
 bearing
 these
 and
 other
 grievous
 burdens
 hypocritical
 officials
 could
 find
 excuse
 for
 personal
 exemption
 Their
 inordinate
 vanity
 and
 their
 irreverent
 assumption
 of
 excessive
 piety
 were
 thus
 stigmatized
 But
 all
 their
 works
 they
 do
 for
 to
 be
 seen
 of
 men
 they
 make
 broad
 their
 phylacteries
 and
 enlarge
 the
 borders
 of
 their
 garments
 and
 love
 the
 uppermost
 rooms
 at
 feasts
 and
 the
 chief
 seats
 in
 the
 synagogues
 and
 greetings
 in
 the
 markets
 and
 to
 be
 called
 of
 men
 Rabbi
 Rabbi
 The
 highsounding
 title
 Rabbi
 signifying
 Master
 Teacher
 or
 Doctor
 had
 eclipsed
 the
 divinely
 recognized
 sanctity
 of
 priesthood
 to
 be
 a
 rabbi
 of
 the
 Jews
 was
 regarded
 as
 vastly
 superior
 to
 being
 a
 priest
 of
 the
 Most
 High
 God
 But
 be
 not
 ye
 called
 Rabbi
 said
 Jesus
 to
 the
 apostles
 and
 the
 other
 disciples
 present
 for
 one
 is
 your
 Master
 even
 Christ
 and
 all
 ye
 are
 brethren
 And
 call
 no
 man
 your
 father
 upon
 the
 earth
 for
 one
 is
 your
 Father
 which
 is
 in
 heaven
 Neither
 be
 ye
 called
 masters
 for
 one
 is
 your
 Master
 even
 Christ
 Those
 upon
 whom
 would
 rest
 the
 responsibility
 of
 building
 the
 Church
 He
 had
 founded
 were
 not
 to
 aspire
 to
 worldly
 titles
 nor
 the
 honors
 of
 men
 for
 those
 chosen
 ones
 were
 brethren
 and
 their
 sole
 purpose
 should
 be
 the
 rendering
 of
 the
 greatest
 possible
 service
 to
 their
 one
 and
 only
 Master
 As
 had
 been
 so
 strongly
 impressed
 on
 earlier
 occasions
 excellence
 or
 supremacy
 in
 the
 apostolic
 calling
 and
 similarly
 in
 the
 duties
 of
 discipleship
 or
 membership
 in
 the
 Church
 of
 Christ
 was
 and
 is
 to
 be
 achieved
 through
 humble
 and
 devoted
 service
 alone
 therefore
 said
 the
 Master
 again
 he
 that
 is
 greatest
 among
 you
 shall
 be
 your
 servant
 And
 whosoever
 shall
 exalt
 himself
 shall
 be
 abased
 and
 he
 that
 shall
 humble
 himself
 shall
 be
 exalted
 From
 the
 mixed
 multitude
 of
 disciples
 and
 unbelievers
 comprizing
 many
 of
 the
 common
 people
 who
 listened
 in
 glad
 eagerness
 to
 learn
 Jesus
 turned
 to
 the
 already
 abashed
 yet
 angry
 rulers
 and
 deluged
 them
 with
 a
 veritable
 torrent
 of
 righteous
 indignation
 through
 which
 flashed
 the
 lightning
 of
 scorching
 invective
 accompanied
 by
 thunder
 peals
 of
 divine
 anathema
 But
 woe
 unto
 you
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 hypocrites
 for
 ye
 shut
 up
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 against
 men
 for
 ye
 neither
 go
 in
 yourselves
 neither
 suffer
 ye
 them
 that
 are
 entering
 to
 go
 in
 The
 Pharisaic
 standard
 of
 piety
 was
 the
 learning
 of
 the
 schools
 one
 unversed
 in
 the
 technicalities
 of
 the
 law
 was
 accounted
 as
 unacceptable
 to
 God
 and
 veritably
 accursed
 By
 their
 casuistry
 and
 perverted
 explications
 of
 scripture
 they
 confused
 and
 misled
 the
 common
 people
 and
 so
 stood
 as
 obstacles
 at
 the
 entrance
 to
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 refusing
 to
 go
 in
 themselves
 and
 barring
 the
 way
 to
 others
 Woe
 unto
 you
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 hypocrites
 for
 ye
 devour
 widows
 houses
 and
 for
 a
 pretence
 make
 long
 prayer
 therefore
 ye
 shall
 receive
 the
 greater
 damnation
 The
 avarice
 of
 the
 Jewish
 hierarchy
 in
 our
 Lords
 lifetime
 was
 an
 open
 scandal
 By
 extortion
 and
 unlawful
 exaction
 under
 cover
 of
 religious
 duty
 the
 priestly
 rulers
 had
 amassed
 an
 enormous
 treasure
 of
 which
 the
 contributions
 of
 the
 poor
 and
 the
 confiscation
 of
 property
 including
 even
 the
 houses
 of
 dependent
 widows
 formed
 a
 considerable
 proportion
 and
 the
 perfidy
 of
 the
 practise
 was
 made
 the
 blacker
 by
 the
 outward
 pretense
 of
 sanctity
 and
 the
 sacrilegious
 accompaniment
 of
 wordy
 prayer
 Woe
 unto
 you
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 hypocrites
 for
 ye
 compass
 sea
 and
 land
 to
 make
 one
 proselyte
 and
 when
 he
 is
 made
 ye
 make
 him
 twofold
 more
 the
 child
 of
 hell
 than
 yourselves
 It
 is
 possible
 that
 this
 woe
 was
 directed
 more
 against
 the
 effort
 to
 secure
 proselytes
 to
 Pharisaism
 than
 that
 of
 converting
 aliens
 to
 Judaism
 but
 as
 the
 latter
 was
 thoroughly
 degraded
 and
 the
 former
 disgustingly
 corrupt
 the
 application
 of
 our
 Lords
 denunciation
 to
 either
 or
 both
 is
 warranted
 Of
 the
 Jews
 who
 strove
 to
 make
 proselytes
 it
 has
 been
 said
 that
 out
 of
 a
 bad
 heathen
 they
 made
 a
 worse
 Jew
 Many
 of
 their
 converts
 soon
 became
 perverts
 Woe
 unto
 you
 ye
 blind
 guides
 which
 say
 Whosoever
 shall
 swear
 by
 the
 temple
 it
 is
 nothing
 but
 whosoever
 shall
 swear
 by
 the
 gold
 of
 the
 temple
 he
 is
 a
 debtor
 Ye
 fools
 and
 blind
 for
 whether
 is
 greater
 the
 gold
 or
 the
 temple
 that
 sanctifieth
 the
 gold
 And
 Whosoever
 shall
 swear
 by
 the
 altar
 it
 is
 nothing
 but
 whosoever
 sweareth
 by
 the
 gift
 that
 is
 upon
 it
 he
 is
 guilty
 Ye
 fools
 and
 blind
 for
 whether
 is
 greater
 the
 gift
 or
 the
 altar
 that
 sanctifieth
 the
 gift
 Whoso
 therefore
 shall
 swear
 by
 the
 altar
 sweareth
 by
 it
 and
 by
 all
 things
 thereon
 And
 whoso
 shall
 swear
 by
 the
 temple
 sweareth
 by
 it
 and
 by
 him
 that
 dwelleth
 therein
 And
 he
 that
 shall
 swear
 by
 heaven
 sweareth
 by
 the
 throne
 of
 God
 and
 by
 him
 that
 sitteth
 thereon
 Thus
 did
 the
 Lord
 condemn
 the
 infamous
 enactments
 of
 the
 schools
 and
 the
 Sanhedrin
 concerning
 oaths
 and
 vows
 for
 they
 had
 established
 or
 endorsed
 a
 code
 of
 rules
 inconsistent
 and
 unjust
 as
 to
 technical
 trifles
 by
 which
 a
 vow
 could
 be
 enforced
 or
 invalidated
 If
 a
 man
 swore
 by
 the
 temple
 the
 House
 of
 Jehovah
 he
 could
 obtain
 an
 indulgence
 for
 breaking
 his
 oath
 but
 if
 he
 vowed
 by
 the
 gold
 and
 treasure
 of
 the
 Holy
 House
 he
 was
 bound
 by
 the
 unbreakable
 bonds
 of
 priestly
 dictum
 Though
 one
 should
 swear
 by
 the
 altar
 of
 God
 his
 oath
 could
 be
 annulled
 but
 if
 he
 vowed
 by
 the
 corban
 gift
 or
 by
 the
 gold
 upon
 the
 altar
 his
 obligation
 was
 imperative
 To
 what
 depths
 of
 unreason
 and
 hopeless
 depravity
 had
 men
 fallen
 how
 sinfully
 foolish
 and
 how
 wilfully
 blind
 were
 they
 who
 saw
 not
 that
 the
 temple
 was
 greater
 than
 its
 gold
 and
 the
 altar
 than
 the
 gift
 that
 lay
 upon
 it
 In
 the
 Sermon
 on
 the
 Mount
 the
 Lord
 had
 said
 Swear
 not
 at
 all
 but
 upon
 such
 as
 would
 not
 live
 according
 to
 that
 higher
 law
 upon
 those
 who
 persisted
 in
 the
 use
 of
 oaths
 and
 vows
 the
 lesser
 and
 evidently
 just
 requirement
 of
 strict
 fidelity
 to
 the
 terms
 of
 selfassumed
 obligations
 was
 to
 be
 enforced
 without
 unrighteous
 quibble
 or
 inequitable
 discrimination
 Woe
 unto
 you
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 hypocrites
 for
 ye
 pay
 tithe
 of
 mint
 and
 anise
 and
 cummin
 and
 have
 omitted
 the
 weightier
 matters
 of
 the
 law
 judgment
 mercy
 and
 faith
 these
 ought
 ye
 to
 have
 done
 and
 not
 to
 leave
 the
 other
 undone
 Ye
 blind
 guides
 which
 strain
 at
 a
 gnat
 and
 swallow
 a
 camel
 The
 law
 of
 the
 tithe
 had
 been
 a
 characteristic
 feature
 of
 the
 theocratic
 requirements
 in
 Israel
 from
 the
 days
 of
 Moses
 and
 the
 practise
 really
 long
 antedated
 the
 exodus
 As
 literally
 construed
 the
 law
 required
 the
 tithing
 of
 flocks
 and
 herds
 fruit
 and
 grain
 but
 by
 traditional
 extension
 all
 products
 of
 the
 soil
 had
 been
 included
 The
 conscientious
 tithing
 of
 all
 ones
 possessions
 even
 potherbs
 and
 other
 garden
 produce
 was
 approved
 by
 the
 Lord
 but
 He
 denounced
 as
 rank
 hypocrisy
 the
 observance
 of
 such
 requirements
 as
 an
 excuse
 for
 neglecting
 the
 other
 duties
 of
 true
 religion
 The
 reference
 to
 the
 weightier
 matters
 of
 the
 law
 may
 have
 been
 an
 allusion
 to
 the
 rabbinical
 classification
 of
 light
 and
 heavy
 requirements
 under
 the
 law
 though
 it
 is
 certain
 the
 Lord
 approved
 no
 such
 arbitrary
 distinctions
 To
 omit
 the
 tithing
 of
 small
 things
 such
 as
 mint
 leaves
 and
 sprigs
 of
 anise
 and
 cummin
 was
 to
 fall
 short
 in
 dutiful
 observance
 but
 to
 ignore
 the
 claims
 of
 judgment
 mercy
 and
 faith
 was
 to
 forfeit
 ones
 claim
 to
 blessing
 as
 a
 covenant
 child
 of
 God
 By
 a
 strong
 simile
 the
 Lord
 stigmatized
 such
 inconsistency
 as
 comparable
 to
 ones
 scrupulous
 straining
 at
 a
 gnat
 while
 figuratively
 willing
 to
 gulp
 down
 a
 camel
 Woe
 unto
 you
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 hypocrites
 for
 ye
 make
 clean
 the
 outside
 of
 the
 cup
 and
 of
 the
 platter
 but
 within
 they
 are
 full
 of
 extortion
 and
 excess
 Thou
 blind
 Pharisee
 cleanse
 first
 that
 which
 is
 within
 the
 cup
 and
 platter
 that
 the
 outside
 of
 them
 may
 be
 clean
 also
 Pharisaic
 scrupulosity
 in
 the
 ceremonial
 cleansing
 of
 platters
 and
 cups
 pots
 and
 brazen
 vessels
 has
 been
 already
 alluded
 to
 Cleanliness
 the
 Lord
 in
 no
 wise
 depreciated
 His
 shafts
 of
 disapprobation
 were
 aimed
 at
 the
 hypocrisy
 of
 maintaining
 at
 once
 outward
 spotlessness
 and
 inward
 corruption
 Cups
 and
 platters
 though
 cleansed
 to
 perfection
 were
 filthy
 before
 the
 Lord
 if
 their
 contents
 had
 been
 bought
 by
 the
 gold
 of
 extortion
 or
 were
 to
 be
 used
 in
 pandering
 to
 gluttony
 drunkenness
 or
 other
 excess
 Woe
 unto
 you
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 hypocrites
 for
 ye
 are
 like
 unto
 whited
 sepulchres
 which
 indeed
 appear
 beautiful
 outward
 but
 are
 within
 full
 of
 dead
 mens
 bones
 and
 of
 all
 uncleanness
 Even
 so
 ye
 also
 outwardly
 appear
 righteous
 unto
 men
 but
 within
 ye
 are
 full
 of
 hypocrisy
 and
 iniquity
 It
 was
 an
 awful
 figure
 that
 of
 likening
 them
 to
 whitewashed
 tombs
 full
 of
 dead
 bones
 and
 rotting
 flesh
 As
 the
 dogmas
 of
 the
 rabbis
 made
 even
 the
 slightest
 contact
 with
 a
 corpse
 or
 its
 cerements
 or
 with
 the
 bier
 upon
 which
 it
 was
 borne
 or
 the
 grave
 in
 which
 it
 had
 been
 lain
 a
 cause
 of
 personal
 defilement
 which
 only
 ceremonial
 washing
 and
 the
 offering
 of
 sacrifices
 could
 remove
 care
 was
 taken
 to
 make
 tombs
 conspicuously
 white
 so
 that
 no
 person
 need
 be
 defiled
 through
 ignorance
 of
 proximity
 to
 such
 unclean
 places
 and
 moreover
 the
 periodical
 whitening
 of
 sepulchres
 was
 regarded
 as
 a
 memorial
 act
 of
 honor
 to
 the
 dead
 But
 even
 as
 no
 amount
 of
 care
 or
 degree
 of
 diligence
 in
 keeping
 bright
 the
 outside
 of
 a
 tomb
 could
 stay
 the
 putrescence
 going
 on
 within
 so
 no
 externals
 of
 pretended
 righteousness
 could
 mitigate
 the
 revolting
 corruption
 of
 a
 heart
 reeking
 with
 iniquity
 Jesus
 had
 before
 compared
 Pharisees
 with
 unmarked
 graves
 over
 which
 men
 inadvertently
 walked
 and
 so
 became
 defiled
 though
 they
 knew
 it
 not
 on
 the
 occasion
 now
 under
 consideration
 He
 denounced
 them
 as
 whitened
 tombs
 flauntingly
 prominent
 but
 sepulchres
 nevertheless
 Woe
 unto
 you
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 hypocrites
 because
 ye
 build
 the
 tombs
 of
 the
 prophets
 and
 garnish
 the
 sepulchres
 of
 the
 righteous
 And
 say
 If
 we
 had
 been
 in
 the
 days
 of
 our
 fathers
 we
 would
 not
 have
 been
 partakers
 with
 them
 in
 the
 blood
 of
 the
 prophets
 Wherefore
 ye
 be
 witnesses
 unto
 yourselves
 that
 ye
 are
 the
 children
 of
 them
 which
 killed
 the
 prophets
 National
 pride
 not
 wholly
 unlike
 patriotism
 had
 for
 centuries
 expressed
 itself
 in
 formal
 regard
 for
 the
 burial
 crypts
 of
 the
 ancient
 prophets
 many
 of
 whom
 had
 been
 slain
 because
 of
 their
 righteous
 and
 fearless
 zeal
 Those
 modern
 Jews
 were
 voluble
 to
 disavow
 all
 sympathy
 with
 the
 murderous
 deeds
 of
 their
 progenitors
 who
 had
 martyred
 the
 prophets
 and
 ostentatiously
 averred
 that
 if
 they
 had
 lived
 in
 the
 times
 of
 those
 martyrdoms
 they
 would
 have
 been
 no
 participators
 therein
 yet
 by
 such
 avouchment
 they
 proclaimed
 themselves
 the
 offspring
 of
 those
 who
 had
 shed
 innocent
 blood
 With
 scorching
 maledictions
 the
 Lord
 thus
 consigned
 them
 to
 their
 fate
 Fill
 ye
 up
 then
 the
 measure
 of
 your
 fathers
 Ye
 serpents
 ye
 generation
 of
 vipers
 how
 can
 ye
 escape
 the
 damnation
 of
 hell
 Wherefore
 behold
 I
 send
 unto
 you
 prophets
 and
 wise
 men
 and
 scribes
 and
 some
 of
 them
 ye
 shall
 kill
 and
 crucify
 and
 some
 of
 them
 shall
 ye
 scourge
 in
 your
 synagogues
 and
 persecute
 them
 from
 city
 to
 city
 That
 upon
 you
 may
 come
 all
 the
 righteous
 blood
 shed
 upon
 the
 earth
 from
 the
 blood
 of
 righteous
 Abel
 unto
 the
 blood
 of
 Zacharias
 son
 of
 Barachias
 whom
 ye
 slew
 between
 the
 temple
 and
 the
 altar
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 All
 these
 things
 shall
 come
 upon
 this
 generation
 To
 their
 sanctimonious
 asseverations
 of
 superiority
 over
 their
 fathers
 who
 had
 slain
 Jehovahs
 envoys
 Jehovah
 Himself
 replied
 by
 predicting
 that
 they
 would
 dye
 their
 hands
 in
 the
 blood
 of
 prophets
 wise
 men
 and
 righteous
 scribes
 whom
 He
 would
 send
 amongst
 them
 and
 thus
 would
 they
 prove
 themselves
 literal
 sons
 of
 murderers
 and
 murderers
 themselves
 so
 that
 upon
 them
 should
 rest
 the
 burden
 of
 all
 the
 righteous
 blood
 that
 had
 been
 shed
 for
 a
 testimony
 of
 God
 from
 righteous
 Abel
 to
 the
 martyred
 Zacharias
 That
 dread
 fate
 outlined
 with
 such
 awful
 realism
 was
 to
 be
 no
 eventuality
 of
 the
 distant
 future
 every
 one
 of
 the
 frightful
 woes
 the
 Lord
 had
 uttered
 was
 to
 be
 realized
 in
 that
 generation
 THE
 LORDS
 LAMENTATION
 OVER
 JERUSALEM
 Concerning
 scribes
 Pharisees
 and
 Pharisaism
 Jesus
 had
 uttered
 His
 last
 word
 Looking
 from
 the
 temple
 heights
 out
 over
 the
 city
 of
 the
 great
 King
 soon
 to
 be
 abandoned
 to
 destruction
 the
 Lord
 was
 obsessed
 by
 emotions
 of
 profound
 sorrow
 With
 the
 undying
 eloquence
 of
 anguish
 He
 broke
 forth
 in
 such
 a
 lamentation
 as
 no
 mortal
 father
 ever
 voiced
 over
 the
 most
 unfilial
 and
 recreant
 of
 sons
 O
 Jerusalem
 Jerusalem
 thou
 that
 killest
 the
 prophets
 and
 stonest
 them
 which
 are
 sent
 unto
 thee
 how
 often
 would
 I
 have
 gathered
 thy
 children
 together
 even
 as
 a
 hen
 gathereth
 her
 chickens
 under
 her
 wings
 and
 ye
 would
 not
 Behold
 your
 house
 is
 left
 unto
 you
 desolate
 For
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Ye
 shall
 not
 see
 me
 henceforth
 till
 ye
 shall
 say
 Blessed
 is
 he
 that
 cometh
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Lord
 Had
 Israel
 but
 received
 her
 King
 the
 worlds
 history
 of
 postmeridian
 time
 would
 never
 have
 been
 what
 it
 is
 The
 children
 of
 Israel
 had
 spurned
 the
 proffered
 safety
 of
 a
 protecting
 paternal
 wing
 soon
 the
 Roman
 eagle
 would
 swoop
 down
 upon
 them
 and
 slay
 The
 stupendous
 temple
 which
 but
 a
 day
 before
 the
 Lord
 had
 called
 My
 house
 was
 now
 no
 longer
 specifically
 His
 Your
 house
 said
 He
 is
 left
 unto
 you
 desolate
 He
 was
 about
 to
 withdraw
 from
 both
 temple
 and
 nation
 and
 by
 the
 Jews
 His
 face
 was
 not
 again
 to
 be
 seen
 until
 through
 the
 discipline
 of
 centuries
 of
 suffering
 they
 shall
 be
 prepared
 to
 acclaim
 in
 accents
 of
 abiding
 faith
 as
 some
 of
 them
 had
 shouted
 but
 the
 Sunday
 before
 under
 the
 impulse
 of
 an
 erroneous
 conception
 Blessed
 is
 he
 that
 cometh
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Lord
 A
 WIDOWS
 GIFT
 From
 the
 open
 courts
 Jesus
 moved
 over
 toward
 the
 colonnaded
 treasury
 of
 the
 temple
 and
 there
 He
 sat
 seemingly
 absorbed
 in
 a
 revery
 of
 sorrow
 Within
 that
 space
 were
 thirteen
 chests
 each
 provided
 with
 a
 trumpetshaped
 receptacle
 and
 into
 these
 the
 people
 dropped
 their
 contributions
 for
 the
 several
 purposes
 indicated
 by
 inscriptions
 on
 the
 boxes
 Looking
 up
 Jesus
 observed
 the
 lines
 of
 donors
 of
 all
 ranks
 and
 degrees
 of
 affluence
 and
 poverty
 some
 depositing
 their
 gifts
 with
 evident
 devoutness
 and
 sincerity
 of
 purpose
 others
 ostentatiously
 casting
 in
 great
 sums
 of
 silver
 and
 gold
 primarily
 to
 be
 seen
 of
 men
 Among
 the
 many
 was
 a
 poor
 widow
 who
 with
 probable
 effort
 to
 escape
 observation
 dropped
 into
 one
 of
 the
 treasurechests
 two
 small
 bronze
 coins
 known
 as
 mites
 her
 contribution
 amounted
 to
 less
 than
 half
 a
 cent
 in
 American
 money
 The
 Lord
 called
 His
 disciples
 about
 Him
 directed
 their
 attention
 to
 the
 povertystricken
 widow
 and
 her
 deed
 and
 said
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 That
 this
 poor
 widow
 hath
 cast
 more
 in
 than
 all
 they
 which
 have
 cast
 into
 the
 treasury
 For
 all
 they
 did
 cast
 in
 of
 their
 abundance
 but
 she
 of
 her
 want
 did
 cast
 in
 all
 that
 she
 had
 even
 all
 her
 living
 In
 the
 accounts
 kept
 by
 the

 figured

 according
 to
 the
 arithmetic

 made
 in
 terms
 of
 quality
 rather
 than
 of
 quantity
 and
 values
 are
 determined
 termined
 on
 the
 basis
 of

 and
 intent
 The
 rich
 gave
 much
 yet
 kept
 back
 more
 the
 widows
 gift
 was
 her
 all
 It
 was
 not
 the
 smallness
 of
 her
 offering
 that
 made
 it
 especially
 acceptable
 but
 the
 spirit
 of
 sacrifice
 and
 devout
 intent
 with
 which
 she
 gave
 On
 the
 books
 of
 the
 heavenly
 accountants
 that
 widows
 contribution
 was
 entered
 as
 a
 munificent
 gift
 surpassing
 in
 worth
 the
 largess
 of
 kings
 For
 if
 there
 be
 first
 a
 willing
 mind
 it
 is
 accepted
 according
 to
 that
 a

 hath
 and

 that

 CHRISTS
 FINAL
 WITHDRAWAL
 FROM
 THE
 TEMPLE
 Our
 Lords
 public
 discourses
 and
 the
 open
 colloquies
 in
 which
 He
 had
 participated
 with
 professionals
 and
 priestly
 officials
 in
 the
 course
 of
 His
 daily
 visits
 to
 the
 temple
 during
 the
 first
 half
 of
 Passion
 week
 had
 caused
 many
 of
 the
 chief
 rulers
 beside
 others
 to
 believe
 on
 Him
 as
 the
 veritable
 Son
 of
 God
 but
 the
 fear
 of
 Pharisaic
 persecution
 and
 the
 dread
 of
 excommunication
 from
 the
 synagog
 deterred
 them
 from
 confessing
 the
 allegiance
 they
 felt
 and
 from
 accepting
 the
 means
 of
 salvation
 so
 freely
 offered
 They
 loved
 the
 praise
 of
 men
 more
 than
 the
 praise
 of
 God
 It
 may
 have
 been
 while
 Jesus
 directed
 His
 course
 for
 the
 last
 time
 toward
 the
 exit
 portal
 of
 the
 onetime
 holy
 place
 that
 He
 uttered
 the
 solemn
 testimony
 of
 His
 divinity
 recorded
 by
 John
 Crying
 with
 a
 loud
 voice
 to
 priestly
 rulers
 and
 the
 multitude
 generally
 He
 said
 He
 that
 believeth
 on
 me
 believeth
 not
 on
 me
 but
 on
 him
 that
 sent
 me
 And
 he
 that
 seeth
 me
 seeth
 him
 that
 sent
 me
 Allegiance
 to
 Himself
 was
 allegiance
 to
 God
 the
 people
 were
 plainly
 told
 that
 to
 accept
 Him
 was
 in
 no
 degree
 a
 weakening
 of
 their
 adherence
 to
 Jehovah
 but
 on
 the
 contrary
 a
 confirmation
 thereof
 Repeating
 precepts
 of
 earlier
 utterance
 He
 again
 proclaimed
 Himself
 the
 light
 of
 the
 world
 by
 whose
 rays
 alone
 mankind
 might
 be
 delivered
 from
 the
 enveloping
 darkness
 of
 spiritual
 unbelief
 The
 testimony
 He
 left
 with
 the
 people
 would
 be
 the
 means
 of
 judgment
 and
 condemnation
 to
 all
 who
 wilfully
 rejected
 it
 For
 said
 He
 in
 solemn
 finality
 I
 have
 not
 spoken
 of
 myself
 but
 the
 Father
 which
 sent
 me
 he
 gave
 me
 a
 commandment
 what
 I
 should
 say
 and
 what
 I
 should
 speak
 And
 I
 know
 that
 his
 commandment
 is
 life
 everlasting
 whatsoever
 I
 speak
 therefore
 even
 as
 the
 Father
 said
 unto
 me
 so
 I
 speak
 DESTRUCTION
 OF
 THE
 TEMPLE
 PREDICTED
 As
 Jesus
 was
 departing
 from
 the
 enclosure
 wherein
 stood
 what
 once
 had
 been
 the
 House
 of
 the
 Lord
 one
 or
 more
 of
 the
 disciples
 called
 His
 attention
 to
 the
 magnificent
 structures
 the
 massive
 stones
 the
 colossal
 columns
 and
 the
 lavish
 and
 costly
 adornment
 of
 the
 several
 buildings
 The
 Lords
 answering
 comment
 was
 an
 unqualified
 prophecy
 of
 the
 utter
 destruction
 of
 the
 temple
 and
 everything
 pertaining
 to
 it
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 There
 shall
 not
 be
 left
 here
 one
 stone
 upon
 another
 that
 shall
 not
 be
 thrown
 down
 Such
 was
 the
 definite
 and
 dire
 prediction
 Those
 who
 heard
 were
 dumbfounded
 neither
 by
 question
 nor
 other
 response
 did
 they
 attempt
 to
 elicit
 more
 The
 literal
 fulfilment
 of
 that
 awful
 portent
 was
 but
 an
 incident
 in
 the
 annihilation
 of
 the
 city
 less
 than
 forty
 years
 later
 With
 the
 Lords
 final
 departure
 from
 the
 temple
 which
 probably
 occurred
 in
 the
 afternoon
 of
 the
 Tuesday
 of
 that
 last
 week
 His
 public
 ministry
 was
 brought
 to
 its
 solemn
 ending
 Whatever
 of
 discourse
 parable
 or
 ordinance
 was
 to
 follow
 would
 be
 directed
 only
 to
 the
 further
 instruction
 and
 investiture
 of
 the
 apostles
 NOTES

 CHAPTER
 
 
 The
 Image
 on
 the
 CoinThe
 Jews
 had
 an
 aversion
 for
 images
 or
 effigies
 in
 general
 the
 use
 of
 which
 they
 professed
 to
 hold
 as
 a
 violation
 of
 the
 second
 commandment
 Their
 scruples
 however
 did
 not
 deter
 them
 from
 accepting
 coins
 bearing
 the
 effigies
 of
 kings
 even
 though
 these
 monarchs
 were
 pagans
 Their
 own
 coins
 bore
 other
 devices
 such
 as
 plants
 fruits
 etc
 in
 place
 of
 a
 human
 head
 and
 the
 Romans
 had
 condescendingly
 permitted
 the
 issue
 of
 a
 special
 coinage
 for
 Jewish
 use
 each
 piece
 bearing
 the
 name
 but
 not
 the
 effigy
 of
 the
 monarch
 The
 ordinary
 coinage
 of
 Rome
 was
 current
 in
 Palestine

 Submission
 to
 Secular
 AuthorityGovernments
 are
 instituted
 of
 God
 sometimes
 by
 His
 direct
 interposition
 sometimes
 by
 His
 permission
 When
 the
 Jews
 had
 been
 brought
 into
 subjection
 by
 Nebuchadnezzar
 king
 of
 Babylon
 the
 Lord
 commanded
 through
 the
 prophet
 Jeremiah
 
 that
 the
 people
 render
 obedience
 to
 their
 conqueror
 whom
 He
 called
 His
 servant
 for
 verily
 the
 Lord
 had
 used
 the
 pagan
 king
 to
 chastize
 the
 recreant
 and
 unfaithful
 children
 of
 the
 covenant
 The
 obedience
 so
 enjoined
 included
 the
 payment
 of
 taxes
 and
 extended
 to
 complete
 submission
 After
 the
 death
 of
 Christ
 the
 apostles
 taught
 obedience
 to
 the
 powers
 that
 be
 which
 powers
 Paul
 declared
 are
 ordained
 of
 God
 See
 Rom
 
 Titus
 
 
 Tim
 
 see

 Peter
 
 
 Through
 the
 medium
 of
 modern
 revelation
 the
 Lord
 has
 required
 of
 His
 people
 in

 present
 dispensation
 obedience
 to
 and
 loyal
 support

 Marriage

 revelation
 in

 Divisions
 and
 Subdivisions
 of
 the
 LawThe
 Rabbinical
 schools
 in
 their
 meddling
 carnal
 superficial
 spirit
 of
 wordweaving
 and
 letterworship
 had
 spun
 large
 accumulations
 of
 worthless
 subtlety
 all
 over
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 Among
 other
 things
 they
 had
 wasted
 their
 idleness
 in
 fantastic
 attempts
 to
 count
 and
 classify
 and
 weigh
 and
 measure
 all
 the
 separate
 commandments
 of
 the
 ceremonial
 and
 moral
 law
 They
 had
 come
 to
 the
 sapient
 conclusion
 that
 there
 were
 
 affirmative
 precepts
 being
 as
 many
 as
 the
 members
 in
 the
 human
 body
 and
 
 negative
 precepts
 being
 as
 many
 as
 the
 arteries
 and
 veins
 or
 the
 days
 of
 the
 year
 the
 total
 being
 
 which
 was
 also
 the
 number
 of
 letters
 in
 the
 decalog
 They
 arrived
 at
 the
 same
 result
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 Jews
 were
 commanded
 Numb
 
 to
 wear
 fringes
 tsitsith
 on
 the
 corners
 of
 their
 tallith
 bound
 with
 a
 thread
 of
 blue
 and
 as
 each
 fringe
 had
 eight
 threads
 and
 five
 knots
 and
 the
 letters
 of
 the
 word
 tsitsith
 make
 
 the
 total
 number
 of
 commandments
 was
 as
 before
 
 Now
 surely
 out
 of
 such
 a
 large
 number
 of
 precepts
 and
 prohibitions
 all
 could
 not
 be
 of
 quite
 the
 same
 value
 some
 were
 light
 kal
 and
 some
 were
 heavy
 kobhed
 But
 which
 and
 what
 was
 the
 greatest
 commandment
 of
 all
 According
 to
 some
 Rabbis
 the
 most
 important
 of
 all
 is
 that
 about
 the
 tephillin
 and
 the
 tsitsith
 the
 fringes
 and
 phylacteries
 and
 he
 who
 diligently
 observes
 it
 is
 regarded
 in
 the
 same
 light
 as
 if
 he
 had
 kept
 the
 whole
 Law
 Some
 thought
 the
 omission
 of
 ablutions
 as
 bad
 as
 homicide
 some
 that
 the
 precepts
 of
 the
 Mishna
 were
 all
 heavy
 those
 of
 the
 Law
 were
 some
 heavy
 and
 some
 light
 Others
 considered
 the
 third
 to
 be
 the
 greatest
 commandment
 None
 of
 them
 had
 realized
 the
 great
 principle
 that
 the
 wilful
 violation
 of
 one
 commandment
 is
 the
 transgression
 of
 all
 James
 
 because
 the
 object
 of
 the
 entire
 Law
 is
 the
 spirit
 of
 obedience
 to
 God
 On
 the
 question
 proposed
 by
 the
 lawyer
 the
 Shammaites
 and
 Hillelites
 were
 in
 disaccord
 and
 as
 usual
 both
 schools
 were
 wrong
 the
 Shammaites
 in
 thinking
 that
 mere
 trivial
 external
 observances
 were
 valuable
 apart
 from
 the
 spirit
 in
 which
 they
 were
 performed
 and
 the
 principle
 which
 they
 exemplified
 the
 Hillelites
 in
 thinking
 that
 any
 positive
 command
 could
 in
 itself
 be
 unimportant
 and
 in
 not
 seeing
 that
 great
 principles
 are
 essential
 to
 the
 due
 performance
 of
 even
 the
 slightest

 Phylacteries
 and
 BordersThrough
 a
 traditional
 interpretation
 of
 Exo
 
 and
 Deut
 
 the
 Hebrews
 adopted
 the
 custom
 of
 wearing
 phylacteries
 which
 consisted
 essentially
 of
 strips
 of
 parchment
 on
 which
 were
 inscribed
 in
 whole
 or
 in
 part
 the
 following
 texts
 Exo
 
 and
 
 Deut
 
 and
 
 Phylacteries
 were
 worn
 on
 the
 head
 and
 arm
 The
 parchment
 strips
 for
 the
 head
 were
 four
 on
 each
 of
 which
 one
 of
 the
 texts
 cited
 above
 was
 written
 These
 were
 placed
 in
 a
 cubical
 box
 of
 leather
 measuring
 from
 
 inch
 to
 
 inches
 along
 the
 edge
 the
 box
 was
 divided
 into
 four
 compartments
 and
 one
 of
 the
 little
 parchment
 rolls
 was
 placed
 in
 each
 Thongs
 held
 the
 box
 in
 place
 on
 the
 forehead
 between
 the
 eyes
 of
 the
 wearer
 The
 arm
 phylactery
 comprized
 but
 a
 single
 roll
 of
 parchment
 on
 which
 the
 four
 prescribed
 texts
 were
 written
 this
 was
 placed
 in
 a
 little
 box
 which
 was
 bound
 by
 thongs
 to
 the
 inside
 of
 the
 left
 arm
 so
 as
 to
 be
 brought
 close
 to
 the
 heart
 when
 the
 hands
 were
 placed
 together
 in
 the
 attitude
 of
 devotion
 The
 Pharisees
 wore
 the
 arm
 phylactery
 above
 the
 elbow
 while
 their
 rivals
 the
 Sadducees
 fastened
 it
 to
 the
 palm
 of
 the
 hand
 see
 Exo
 
 The
 common
 people
 wore
 phylacteries
 only
 at
 prayer
 time
 but
 the
 Pharisees
 were
 said
 to
 display
 them
 throughout
 the
 day
 Our
 Lords
 reference
 to
 the
 Pharisees
 custom
 of
 making
 broad
 their
 phylacteries
 had
 reference
 to
 the
 enlarging
 of
 the
 containing
 box
 particularly
 the
 frontlet
 The
 size
 of
 the
 parchment
 strips
 was
 fixed
 by
 rigid
 rule
 The
 Lord
 had
 required
 of
 Israel
 through
 Moses
 Numb
 
 that
 the
 people
 attach
 to
 the
 border
 of
 their
 garment
 a
 fringe
 with
 a
 ribbon
 of
 blue
 In
 ostentatious
 display
 of
 assumed
 piety
 the
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 delighted
 to
 wear
 enlarged
 borders
 to
 attract
 public
 attention
 It
 was
 another
 manifestation
 of
 hypocritical
 sanctimoniousness
 
 Ecclesiastical
 TitlesOur
 Lord
 severely
 condemned
 the
 seeking
 after
 titles
 as
 insignia
 of
 rank
 in
 His
 service
 Nevertheless
 He
 named
 the
 Twelve
 whom
 He
 chose
 Apostles
 and
 in
 the
 Church
 founded
 by
 Himself
 the
 offices
 of
 Evangelist
 High
 Priest
 Pastor
 Elder
 Bishop
 Priest
 Teacher
 and
 Deacon
 were
 established
 see
 Articles
 of
 Faith
 xi
 It
 was
 the
 empty
 manmade
 title
 that
 attached
 to
 the
 individual
 not
 the
 authorized
 title
 of
 office
 to
 which
 men
 were
 called
 through
 authoritative
 ordination
 to
 which
 the
 Lord
 affixed
 the
 seal
 of
 His
 disapproval
 Titles
 of
 office
 in
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 are
 of
 too
 sacred
 a
 character
 to
 be
 used
 as
 marks
 of
 distinction
 among
 men
 In
 the
 restored
 Church
 in
 the
 current
 dispensation
 men
 are
 ordained
 to
 the
 Priesthood
 and
 to
 the
 several
 offices
 comprized
 within
 both
 the
 Lesser
 or
 Aaronic
 and
 the
 Higher
 or
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 but
 though
 one
 be
 thus
 made
 an
 Elder
 a
 Seventy
 a
 High
 Priest
 a
 Patriarch
 or
 an
 Apostle
 he
 should
 not
 court
 the
 usage
 of
 the
 title
 as
 a
 mere
 embellishment
 of
 his
 name

 Chas

 Deems

 pp
 
 says
 in
 speaking
 of
 the
 irreverent
 use
 of
 ecclesiastical
 titles
 The
 Pharisees
 loved
 also
 the
 highest
 places
 in
 the
 synagogs
 and
 it
 gratified
 their
 vanity
 to
 be
 called
 Teacher
 Doctor
 Rabbi
 Against
 these
 Jesus
 warned
 His
 disciples
 They
 were
 not
 to
 love
 to
 be
 called
 Rabbi
 a
 title
 which
 occurs
 in
 three
 forms
 Rab
 Teacher
 Doctor
 Rabbi
 My
 Doctor
 or
 Teacher
 Rabboni
 My
 great
 Doctor
 Nor
 were
 they
 to
 call
 any
 man
 Father
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 granting
 him
 any
 infallibility
 of
 judgment
 or
 power
 over
 their
 consciences
 Papa
 as
 the
 simple
 Moravians
 call
 their
 great
 man
 Count
 Zinzendorf
 Founder
 as
 Methodists
 denominate
 good
 John
 Wesley
 Holy
 Father
 in
 God
 as
 bishops
 are
 sometimes
 called
 Pope
 which
 is
 the
 same
 as
 Papa
 Doctor
 of
 Divinity
 the
 Christian
 equivalent
 of
 the
 Jewish
 Rabbi
 are
 all
 dangerous
 titles
 But
 it
 is
 not
 the
 employment
 of
 a
 name
 which
 Jesus
 denounces
 it
 is
 the
 spirit
 of
 vanity
 which
 animated
 the
 Pharisees
 and
 the
 servile
 spirit
 which
 the
 employment
 of
 titles
 is
 apt
 to
 engender
 Paul
 and
 Peter
 spoke
 of
 themselves
 as
 spiritual
 fathers
 Jesus
 teaches
 that
 positions
 in
 the
 societies
 of
 his
 followers
 such
 as
 should
 afterward
 be
 formed
 were
 not
 to
 be
 regarded
 as
 dignities
 but
 rather
 as
 services
 that
 no
 man
 should
 seek
 them
 for
 the
 honor
 they
 might
 confer
 but
 for
 the
 field
 of
 usefulness
 they
 might
 afford
 and
 that
 no
 man
 should
 lead
 off
 a
 sect
 there
 being
 but
 one
 leader
 and
 that
 the
 whole
 body
 of
 believers
 are
 brethren
 of
 whom
 God
 is
 the
 Father
 The
 writer
 last
 quoted
 very
 properly
 disparages
 aspirations
 stimulated
 by
 vanity
 and
 selfrighteous
 assumption
 to
 the
 use
 of
 the
 title
 Reverend
 as
 applied
 to
 men
 
 Seven

 Eight

 of

 omission
 reduces

 There
 is
 no
 question
 as
 to
 the

 of

 which

 The
 Temple
 TreasureIn
 connection
 with
 the
 incident
 of
 the
 widows
 mites
 Edersheim
 vol
 ii
 pp
 
 writes
 Some
 might
 come
 with
 appearance
 of
 selfrighteousness
 some
 even
 with
 ostentation
 some
 as
 cheerfully
 performing
 a
 happy
 duty
 Many
 that
 were
 rich
 cast
 in
 muchyes
 very
 much
 for
 such
 was
 the
 tendency
 that
 a
 law
 had
 to
 be
 enacted
 forbidding
 the
 gift
 to
 the
 Temple
 of
 more
 than
 a
 certain
 proportion
 of
 ones
 possessions
 And
 the
 amount
 of
 such
 contributions
 may
 be
 inferred
 by
 recalling
 the
 circumstance
 that
 at
 the
 time
 of
 Pompey
 and
 Crassus
 the
 Temple
 treasury
 after
 having
 lavishly
 defrayed
 every
 possible
 expenditure
 contained
 in
 money
 nearly
 half
 a
 million
 and
 precious
 vessels
 to
 the
 value
 of
 nearly
 two
 millions
 sterling

 Zacharias
 the
 MartyrIn
 referring
 to
 the
 martyrs
 of
 antemeridian
 time
 the
 Lord
 is
 recorded
 as
 having
 used
 the
 expression
 from
 the
 blood
 of
 righteous
 Abel
 unto
 the
 blood
 of
 Zacharias
 son
 of
 Barachias
 whom
 ye
 slew
 between
 the
 temple
 and
 the
 altar
 Matt
 
 The
 Old
 Testament
 as
 at
 present
 compiled
 contains
 no
 mention
 of
 a
 martyr
 named
 Zacharias
 son
 of
 Barachias
 but
 does
 chronicle
 the
 martyrdom
 of
 Zechariah
 son
 of
 Jehoiada
 
 Chron
 
 Zechariah
 and
 Zacharias
 are
 equivalent
 names
 It
 is
 the
 opinion
 of
 most
 Bible
 scholars
 that
 the
 Zacharias
 referred
 to
 in
 Matthews
 record
 is
 Zechariah
 son
 of
 Jehoiada
 In
 the
 Jewish
 compilation
 of
 Old
 Testament
 scriptures
 the
 murder
 of
 Zechariah
 appears
 as
 the
 last
 recorded
 martyrdom
 and
 the
 Lords
 reference
 to
 the
 righteous
 men
 who
 had
 been
 slain
 from
 Abel
 to
 Zechariah
 or
 Zacharias
 may
 have
 been
 a
 sweeping
 inclusion
 of
 all
 the
 martyrs
 down
 to
 that
 time
 from
 first
 to
 last
 However
 we
 have
 a
 record
 of
 Zechariah
 son
 of
 Berechiah
 Zech
 
 
 and
 this
 Berechiah
 was
 the
 son
 of
 Iddo
 Then
 again
 Zechariah
 son
 of
 Iddo
 is
 mentioned
 Ezra
 
 but
 as
 is
 elsewhere
 found
 in
 the
 older
 scriptures
 the
 grandson
 is
 called
 the
 son
 The
 Old
 Testament
 does
 not
 number
 this
 Zechariah
 among
 the
 martyrs
 but
 traditional
 accounts
 Whitbys
 citation
 of
 the
 Targum
 say
 that
 he
 was
 killed
 in
 the
 day
 of
 propitiation
 That
 the
 Lord
 referred
 to
 a
 late
 and
 probably
 the
 latest
 of
 the
 recorded
 martyrdoms
 is
 probable
 and
 it
 is
 equally
 evident
 that
 the
 case
 was
 well
 known
 among
 the
 Jews
 It
 is
 likely
 that
 a
 fuller
 account
 appeared
 in
 scriptures
 current
 among
 the
 Jews
 at
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 but
 since
 lost

 Destruction
 of
 the
 TempleFor
 thirty
 or
 more
 years
 after
 the
 death
 of
 Christ
 the
 Jews
 continued
 the
 work
 of
 adding
 to
 and
 embellishing
 the
 temple
 buildings
 The
 elaborate
 design
 conceived
 and
 projected
 by
 Herod
 had
 been
 practically
 completed
 the
 Temple
 was
 wellnigh
 finished
 and
 as
 soon
 afterward
 appeared
 was
 ready
 for
 destruction
 Its
 fate
 had
 been
 definitely
 foretold
 by
 the
 Savior
 Himself
 Commenting
 on
 a
 remark
 by
 one
 of
 the
 disciples
 concerning
 the
 great
 stones
 and
 the
 splendid
 buildings
 on
 the
 Temple
 hill
 Jesus
 had
 said
 Seest
 thou
 these
 great
 buildings
 There
 shall
 not
 be
 left
 one
 stone
 upon
 another
 that
 shall
 not
 be
 thrown
 down
 Mark
 
 
 see
 also
 Matt
 
 
 Luke
 
 
 This
 dire
 prediction
 soon
 found
 its
 literal
 fulfilment
 In
 the
 great
 conflict
 with
 the
 Roman
 legions
 under
 Titus
 many
 of
 the
 Jews
 had
 taken
 refuge
 within
 the
 Temple
 courts
 seemingly
 hoping
 that
 there
 the
 Lord
 would
 again
 fight
 the
 battles
 of
 His
 people
 and
 give
 them
 victory
 But
 the
 protecting
 presence
 of
 Jehovah
 had
 long
 since
 departed
 therefrom
 and
 Israel
 was
 left
 a
 prey
 to
 the
 foe
 Though
 Titus
 would
 have
 spared
 the
 Temple
 his
 legionaries
 maddened
 by
 the
 lust
 of
 conflict
 started
 the
 conflagration
 and
 everything
 that
 could
 be
 burned
 was
 burned
 The
 slaughter
 of
 the
 Jews
 was
 appalling
 thousands
 of
 men
 women
 and
 children
 were
 ruthlessly
 butchered
 within
 the
 walls
 and
 the
 temple
 courts
 were
 literally
 flooded
 with
 human
 blood
 This
 event
 occurred
 in
 the
 year
 
 AD
 and
 according
 to
 Josephus
 in
 the
 same
 month
 and
 on
 the
 same
 day
 of
 the
 month
 as
 that
 on
 which
 the
 once
 glorious
 Temple
 of
 Solomon
 had
 fallen
 a
 prey
 to
 the
 flames
 kindled
 by
 the
 king
 of
 Babylon

 and
 representations
 of
 these
 sacred
 pieces
 are
 to
 be
 seen
 on
 the

 Since

 no
 other
 structure
 of
 the
 kind
 no

 no
 House

 Josephus
 ascribes
 the
 destruction
 of
 the
 Temple
 of
 Herod
 to
 the
 anger
 of
 God
 and
 states
 that
 the
 devouring
 flames
 took
 their
 rise
 from
 the
 Jews
 themselves
 and
 were
 occasioned
 by
 them
 The
 soldier
 who
 applied
 the
 torch
 to
 the
 Holy
 House
 which
 had
 remained
 intact
 while
 fire
 raged
 in
 the
 courts
 is
 regarded
 by
 the
 historian
 as
 an
 instrument
 of
 divine
 vengeance
 We
 read
 Wars
 vi
 
 One
 of
 the
 soldiers
 without
 staying
 for
 any
 orders
 and
 without
 any
 concern
 or
 dread
 upon
 him
 at
 so
 great
 an
 undertaking
 and
 being
 hurried
 on
 by
 a
 certain
 divine
 fury
 snatched
 somewhat
 out
 of
 the
 materials
 that
 were
 on
 fire
 and
 being
 lifted
 up
 by
 another
 soldier
 he
 set
 fire
 to
 a
 golden
 window
 through
 which
 there
 was
 a
 passage
 to
 the
 rooms
 that
 were
 round
 the
 Holy
 House
 on
 the
 north
 side
 of
 it
 As
 the
 flames
 went
 upward
 the
 Jews
 made
 a
 great
 clamor
 such
 as
 so
 mighty
 an
 affliction
 required

 FURTHER
 INSTRUCTION
 TO
 THE
 APOSTLES
 PROPHECIES
 RELATING
 TO
 THE
 DESTRUCTION
 OF
 JERUSALEM
 AND
 THE
 LORDS
 FUTURE
 ADVENT
 In
 the
 course
 of
 His
 last
 walk
 from
 Jerusalem
 back
 to
 the
 beloved
 home
 at
 Bethany
 Jesus
 rested
 at
 a
 convenient
 spot
 on
 the
 Mount
 of
 Olives
 from
 which
 the
 great
 city
 and
 the
 magnificent
 temple
 were
 to
 be
 seen
 in
 fullest
 splendor
 illumined
 by
 the
 declining
 sun
 in
 the
 late
 afternoon
 of
 that
 eventful
 April
 day
 As
 He
 sat
 in
 thoughtful
 revery
 He
 was
 approached
 by
 Peter
 and
 James
 John
 and
 Andrew
 of
 the
 Twelve
 and
 to
 them
 certainly
 though
 probably
 to
 all
 the
 apostles
 He
 gave
 instruction
 embodying
 further
 prophecy
 concerning
 the
 future
 of
 Jerusalem
 Israel
 and
 the
 world
 at
 large
 His
 fateful
 predictionthat
 of
 the
 temple
 buildings
 not
 one
 stone
 would
 be
 left
 upon
 anotherhad
 caused
 the
 apostles
 to
 marvel
 and
 fear
 so
 they
 came
 privately
 requesting
 explanation
 Tell
 us
 said
 they
 when
 shall
 these
 things
 be
 and
 what
 shall
 be
 the
 sign
 of
 thy
 coming
 and
 of
 the
 end
 of
 the
 world
 The
 compound
 character
 of
 the
 question
 indicates
 an
 understanding
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 destruction
 of
 which
 the
 Lord
 had
 spoken
 was
 to
 be
 apart
 from
 and
 precedent
 to
 the
 signs
 that
 were
 to
 immediately
 herald
 His
 glorious
 advent
 and
 the
 yet
 later
 ushering
 in
 of
 the
 consummation
 commonly
 spoken
 of
 then
 and
 now
 as
 the
 end
 of
 the
 world
 An
 assumption
 that
 the
 events
 would
 follow
 in
 close
 succession
 is
 implied
 by
 the
 form
 in
 which
 the
 question
 was
 put
 The
 inquiry
 referred
 specifically
 to
 timewhen
 were
 these
 things
 to
 be
 The
 reply
 dealt
 not
 with
 dates
 but
 with
 events
 and
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 subsequent
 discourse
 was
 that
 of
 warning
 against
 misapprehension
 and
 admonition
 to
 ceaseless
 vigilance
 Take
 heed
 that
 no
 man
 deceive
 you
 was
 the
 first
 and
 allimportant
 caution
 for
 within
 the
 lives
 of
 most
 of
 those
 apostles
 many
 blaspheming
 imposters
 would
 arise
 each
 claiming
 to
 be
 the
 Messiah
 The
 return
 of
 Christ
 to
 earth
 as
 Lord
 and
 Judge
 was
 more
 remote
 than
 any
 of
 the
 Twelve
 realized
 Before
 that
 glorious
 event
 many
 wonderful
 and
 appalling
 developments
 would
 be
 witnessed
 among
 the
 earliest
 of
 which
 would
 be
 wars
 and
 rumors
 of
 wars
 caused
 by
 nation
 rising
 against
 nation
 and
 kingdom
 against
 kingdom
 to
 the
 dread
 accompaniment
 of
 famines
 pestilences
 and
 earthquakes
 in
 many
 places
 yet
 all
 these
 would
 be
 but
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 sorrow
 or
 travail
 to
 follow
 They
 the
 apostles
 were
 told
 to
 expect
 persecution
 not
 only
 at
 the
 hands
 of
 irresponsible
 individuals
 but
 at
 the
 instance
 of
 the
 officials
 such
 as
 they
 who
 were
 at
 that
 moment
 intent
 on
 taking
 the
 life
 of
 the
 Lord
 Himself
 and
 who
 would
 scourge
 them
 in
 the
 synagogs
 deliver
 them
 up
 to
 hostile
 tribunals
 cite
 them
 before
 rulers
 and
 kings
 and
 even
 put
 some
 of
 them
 to
 deathall
 because
 of
 their
 testimony
 of
 the
 Christ
 As
 they
 had
 been
 promised
 before
 so
 again
 were
 they
 assured
 that
 when
 they
 would
 stand
 before
 councils
 magistrates
 or
 kings
 the
 words
 they
 should
 speak
 would
 be
 given
 them
 in
 the
 hour
 of
 their
 trial
 and
 therefore
 they
 were
 told
 to
 take
 no
 premeditative
 thought
 as
 to
 what
 they
 should
 say
 or
 how
 they
 should
 meet
 the
 issues
 confronting
 them
 for
 said
 the
 Master
 it
 is
 not
 ye
 that
 speak
 but
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 Even
 though
 they
 found
 themselves
 despized
 and
 hated
 of
 men
 and
 though
 they
 were
 to
 suffer
 ignominy
 torture
 and
 death
 yet
 as
 to
 their
 eternal
 welfare
 they
 were
 promised
 such
 security
 that
 by
 comparison
 they
 would
 lose
 not
 so
 much
 as
 a
 hair
 of
 their
 heads
 In
 consoling
 encouragement
 the
 Lord
 bade
 them
 possess
 their
 souls
 in
 patience
 In
 face
 of
 all
 trials
 and
 even
 the
 direst
 persecution
 it
 was
 incumbent
 upon
 them
 to
 persevere
 in
 their
 ministry
 for
 the
 divine
 plan
 provided
 and
 required
 that
 the
 gospel
 of
 the
 kingdom
 be
 preached
 amongst
 all
 nations
 Their
 labors
 would
 be
 complicated
 and
 opposed
 by
 the
 revolutionary
 propaganda
 of
 many
 false
 prophets
 and
 differences
 of
 creed
 would
 disrupt
 families
 and
 engender
 such
 bitterness
 that
 brothers
 would
 betray
 one
 another
 and
 children
 would
 rise
 against
 their
 parents
 accusing
 them
 of
 heresies
 and
 delivering
 them
 up
 to
 death
 Even
 among
 those
 who
 had
 professed
 discipleship
 to
 Christ
 many
 would
 be
 offended
 and
 hatred
 would
 abound
 love
 for
 the
 gospel
 would
 wax
 cold
 and
 iniquity
 would
 be
 rampant
 among
 men
 and
 only
 those
 who
 would
 endure
 to
 the
 end
 of
 their
 lives
 could
 be
 saved
 From
 this
 circumstantial
 forecast
 of
 conditions
 then
 directly
 impending
 the
 Lord
 passed
 to
 other
 developments
 that
 would
 immediately
 precede
 the
 destruction
 of
 Jerusalem
 and
 the
 total
 disruption
 of
 the
 Jewish
 nation
 When
 ye
 therefore
 shall
 see
 the
 abomination
 of
 desolation
 spoken
 of
 by
 Daniel
 the
 prophet
 stand
 in
 the
 holy
 place
 said
 He
 according
 to
 Matthews
 account
 and
 virtually
 so
 also
 as
 stated
 by
 Mark
 or
 when
 ye
 shall
 see
 Jerusalem
 compassed
 with
 armies
 as
 Luke
 writes
 then
 know
 that
 the
 desolation
 thereof
 is
 nigh
 This
 was
 a
 specific
 sign
 that
 none
 could
 misunderstand
 Daniel
 the
 prophet
 had
 foreseen
 the
 desolation
 and
 abominations
 thereof
 which
 comprized
 the
 forcible
 cessation
 of
 temple
 rites
 and
 the
 desecration
 of
 Israels
 shrine
 by
 pagan
 conquerors
 The
 realization
 of
 Daniels
 prophetic
 vision
 was
 to
 be
 heralded
 by
 the
 encompassing
 of
 Jerusalem
 by
 armies
 Then
 all
 who
 would
 escape
 should
 make
 haste
 from
 Judea
 they
 should
 flee
 to
 the
 mountains
 he
 who
 was
 on
 the
 housetop
 would
 have
 no
 time
 to
 take
 his
 goods
 but
 should
 hasten
 down
 by
 the
 outer
 steps
 and
 flee
 he
 who
 was
 in
 the
 field
 would
 better
 leave
 without
 first
 returning
 to
 his
 house
 even
 for
 his
 clothes
 Terrible
 indeed
 would
 that
 day
 be
 for
 women
 hampered
 by
 the
 conditions
 incident
 to
 approaching
 maternity
 or
 the
 responsibility
 of
 caring
 for
 their
 suckling
 babes
 All
 would
 do
 well
 to
 pray
 that
 their
 flight
 be
 not
 forced
 upon
 them
 in
 winter
 time
 nor
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 lest
 regard
 for
 the
 restrictions
 as
 to
 Sabbathday
 travel
 or
 the
 usual
 closing
 of
 the
 city
 gates
 on
 that
 day
 should
 diminish
 the
 chances
 of
 escape
 The
 tribulations
 of
 the
 time
 then
 foreshadowed
 would
 prove
 to
 be
 unprecedented
 in
 horror
 and
 would
 never
 be
 paralleled
 in
 all
 their
 awful
 details
 in
 Israels
 history
 but
 in
 mercy
 God
 had
 decreed
 that
 the
 dreadful
 period
 should
 be
 shortened
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 the
 elect
 believers
 otherwise
 no
 flesh
 of
 Israel
 would
 be
 saved
 alive
 Multitudes
 were
 to
 fall
 by
 the
 sword
 other
 hosts
 were
 to
 be
 led
 away
 captive
 and
 so
 be
 scattered
 amongst
 all
 nations
 and
 Jerusalem
 the
 pride
 and
 boast
 of
 degenerate
 Israel
 should
 be
 trodden
 down
 of
 the
 Gentiles
 until
 the
 times
 of
 the
 Gentiles
 be
 fulfilled
 In
 every
 frightful
 detail
 was
 the
 Lords
 prediction
 brought
 to
 pass
 as
 history
 avouches
 After
 the
 passing
 of
 those
 terrible
 times
 and
 thence
 onward
 for
 a
 period
 of
 unspecified
 duration
 Satan
 would
 deceive
 the
 world
 through
 false
 doctrines
 spread
 by
 evil
 men
 masquerading
 as
 ministers
 of
 God
 who
 would
 continue
 to
 cry
 Lo
 here
 is
 Christ
 or
 lo
 he
 is
 there
 but
 against
 all
 such
 the
 Twelve
 were
 put
 on
 their
 guard
 and
 through
 them
 and
 other
 teachers
 whom
 they
 would
 call
 and
 ordain
 would
 the
 world
 be
 warned
 Deceiving
 prophets
 emissaries
 of
 the
 devil
 would
 be
 active
 some
 alluring
 people
 into
 the
 deserts
 and
 impelling
 them
 to
 hermit
 lives
 of
 pernicious
 asceticism
 others
 insisting
 that
 Christ
 could
 be
 found
 in
 the
 secret
 chambers
 of
 monastic
 seclusion
 and
 some
 of
 them
 showing
 forth
 through
 the
 power
 of
 Satan
 such
 signs
 and
 wonders
 as
 to
 seduce
 if
 it
 were
 possible
 even
 the
 elect
 but
 of
 all
 such
 scheming
 of
 the
 prince
 of
 evil
 the
 Lord
 admonished
 His
 own
 Believe
 it
 not
 and
 added
 take
 ye
 heed
 behold
 I
 have
 foretold
 you
 all
 things
 In
 the
 day
 of
 the
 Lords
 advent
 in
 glory
 and
 vengeance
 no
 man
 shall
 be
 in
 doubt
 there
 shall
 be
 no
 chance
 of
 conflicting
 claims
 by
 contending
 sects
 For
 as
 the
 lightning
 cometh
 out
 of
 the
 east
 and
 shineth
 even
 unto
 the
 west
 so
 shall
 also
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 be
 The
 gathering
 of
 Israel
 in
 the
 last
 days
 was
 pictured
 as
 the
 flocking
 of
 eagles
 to
 the
 place
 where
 the
 body
 of
 the
 Church
 would
 be
 established
 The
 chronological
 order
 of
 the
 predicted
 occurrences
 so
 far
 considered
 in
 this
 wonderful
 discourse
 on
 things
 to
 come
 is
 clear
 first
 there
 was
 to
 be
 a
 period
 of
 virulent
 persecution
 of
 the
 apostles
 and
 the
 Church
 of
 which
 they
 would
 be
 in
 charge
 then
 the
 destruction
 of
 Jerusalem
 with
 all
 the
 horrors
 of
 merciless
 warfare
 was
 to
 follow
 and
 this
 in
 turn
 was
 to
 be
 succeeded
 by
 a
 long
 period
 of
 priestcraft
 and
 apostasy
 with
 bitter
 sectarian
 dissension
 and
 cruel
 persecution
 of
 the
 righteous
 The
 brief
 reference
 to
 the
 nonlocalized
 universal
 phenomena
 by
 which
 His
 advent
 is
 to
 be
 signalized
 is
 a
 parenthetical
 demonstration
 of
 the
 false
 claims
 as
 to
 where
 Christ
 would
 be
 found
 later
 the
 Lord
 passed
 to
 distinctive
 and
 unquestionable
 reference
 to
 the
 circumstances
 of
 His
 then
 and
 yet
 future
 advent
 Following
 the
 age
 of
 manmade
 creeds
 and
 unauthorized
 ministry
 characteristic
 of
 the
 great
 apostasy
 marvelous
 occurrences
 are
 to
 be
 manifested
 through
 the
 forces
 of
 nature
 and
 the
 sign
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 shall
 ultimately
 appear
 one
 accompanying
 feature
 of
 which
 shall
 be
 the
 completion
 of
 the
 gathering
 of
 the
 elect
 from
 all
 parts
 of
 the
 earth
 to
 the
 places
 appointed
 The
 duty
 that
 Jesus
 enjoined
 upon
 the
 apostles
 as
 of
 first
 importance
 throughout
 all
 the
 coming
 scenes
 of
 sorrow
 suffering
 and
 turmoil
 was
 that
 of
 vigilance
 They
 were
 to
 pray
 watch
 and
 work
 diligently
 and
 with
 unwavering
 faith
 The
 lesson
 was
 illustrated
 by
 a
 masterly
 analogy
 which
 under
 the
 broadest
 classification
 may
 be
 called
 a
 parable
 Directing
 their
 attention
 to
 the
 fig
 tree
 and
 other
 trees
 which
 flourished
 on
 the
 sunny
 slopes
 of
 Olivet
 the
 Master
 said
 Behold
 the
 fig
 tree
 and
 all
 the
 trees
 when
 they
 now
 shoot
 forth
 ye
 see
 and
 know
 of
 your
 own
 selves
 that
 summer
 is
 now
 nigh
 at
 hand
 So
 likewise
 ye
 when
 ye
 see
 these
 things
 come
 to
 pass
 know
 ye
 that
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 is
 nigh
 at
 hand
 Of
 the
 fig
 tree
 in
 particular
 the
 Lord
 remarked
 When
 his
 branch
 is
 yet
 tender
 and
 putteth
 forth
 leaves
 ye
 know
 that
 summer
 is
 nigh
 This
 sign
 of
 events
 near
 at
 hand
 was
 equally
 applicable
 to
 the
 premonitory
 conditions
 which
 were
 to
 herald
 the
 fall
 of
 Jerusalem
 and
 the
 termination
 of
 the
 Jewish
 autonomy
 and
 to
 the
 developments
 by
 which
 the
 Lords
 second
 advent
 shall
 be
 immediately
 preceded
 The
 next
 declaration
 in
 the
 order
 of
 the
 evangelical
 record
 reads
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 This
 generation
 shall
 not
 pass
 till
 all
 these
 things
 be
 fulfilled
 This
 may
 be
 understood
 as
 applying
 to
 the
 generation
 in
 which
 the
 portentous
 happenings
 before
 described
 would
 be
 realized
 So
 far
 as
 the
 predictions
 related
 to
 the
 overthrow
 of
 Jerusalem
 they
 were
 literally
 fulfilled
 within
 the
 natural
 lifetime
 of
 several
 of
 the
 apostles
 and
 of
 multitudes
 of
 their
 contemporaries
 such
 of
 the
 Lords
 prophecies
 as
 pertain
 to
 the
 heralding
 of
 His
 second
 coming
 are
 to
 brought
 to
 pass
 within
 the
 duration
 of
 the
 generation
 of
 some
 who
 witness
 the
 inauguration
 of
 their
 fulfilment
 The
 certainty
 of
 fulfilment
 was
 emphasized
 by
 the
 Lord
 in
 the
 profound
 affirmation
 Heaven
 and
 Earth
 shall
 pass
 away
 but
 my
 words
 shall
 not
 pass
 away
 All
 speculation
 concerning
 the
 time
 of
 the
 Lords
 appearing
 whether
 based
 on
 assumption
 deduction
 or
 calculation
 of
 dates
 was
 forestalled
 by
 Christs
 averment
 But
 of
 that
 day
 and
 that
 hour
 knoweth
 no
 man
 no
 not
 the
 angels
 which
 are
 in
 heaven
 neither
 the
 Son
 but
 the
 Father
 That
 His
 advent
 in
 power
 and
 glory
 is
 to
 be
 sudden
 and
 unexpected
 to
 the
 unobserving
 and
 sinful
 world
 but
 in
 immediate
 sequence
 to
 the
 signs
 which
 the
 vigilant
 and
 devout
 may
 read
 and
 understand
 was
 made
 plain
 by
 comparison
 with
 the
 prevailing
 social
 conditions
 of
 Noahs
 time
 when
 in
 spite
 of
 prophecy
 and
 warning
 the
 people
 had
 continued
 in
 their
 feasting
 and
 merrymaking
 in
 marrying
 and
 giving
 in
 marriage
 until
 the
 very
 day
 of
 Noahs
 entrance
 into
 the
 ark
 And
 knew
 not
 until
 the
 flood
 came
 and
 took
 them
 all
 away
 so
 shall
 also
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 be
 In
 the
 last
 stages
 of
 the
 gathering
 of
 the
 elect
 the
 ties
 of
 companionship
 shall
 be
 quickly
 severed
 of
 two
 men
 laboring
 in
 the
 field
 or
 of
 two
 women
 engaged
 side
 by
 side
 in
 household
 duties
 the
 faithful
 one
 shall
 be
 taken
 and
 the
 sinner
 left
 Watch
 therefore
 was
 the
 solemn
 behest
 for
 ye
 know
 not
 what
 hour
 your
 Lord
 doth
 come
 In
 explication
 of
 this
 admonishment
 the
 Lord
 condescended
 to
 compare
 the
 suddenness
 and
 secrecy
 of
 His
 coming
 to
 the
 movements
 of
 a
 nightprowling
 thief
 and
 pointed
 out
 that
 if
 a
 householder
 had
 certain
 knowledge
 as
 to
 the
 time
 of
 a
 burglars
 predetermined
 visit
 he
 would
 remain
 on
 vigilant
 watch
 but
 because
 of
 uncertainty
 he
 may
 be
 found
 off
 his
 guard
 and
 the
 thief
 may
 enter
 and
 despoil
 the
 home
 Again
 likening
 the
 apostles
 to
 duly
 appointed
 stewards
 in
 a
 great
 household
 the
 Lord
 spoke
 of
 Himself
 as
 the
 householder
 saying
 The
 Son
 of
 man
 is
 as
 a
 man
 taking
 a
 far
 journey
 who
 left
 his
 house
 and
 gave
 authority
 to
 his
 servants
 and
 to
 every
 man
 his
 work
 and
 commanded
 the
 porter
 to
 watch
 Watch
 ye
 therefore
 for
 ye
 know
 not
 when
 the
 master
 of
 the
 house
 cometh
 at
 even
 or
 at
 midnight
 or
 at
 the
 cockcrowing
 or
 in
 the
 morning
 Lest
 coming
 suddenly
 he
 find
 you
 sleeping
 And
 what
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 I
 say
 unto
 all
 Watch
 But
 if
 the
 steward
 grow
 negligent
 because
 of
 his
 masters
 long
 absence
 and
 give
 himself
 up
 to
 feasting
 and
 unlicensed
 pleasure
 or
 become
 autocratic
 and
 unjust
 toward
 his
 fellowservants
 his
 lord
 shall
 come
 in
 an
 hour
 when
 least
 expected
 and
 shall
 consign
 that
 wicked
 servant
 to
 a
 place
 among
 the
 hypocrites
 where
 he
 shall
 weep
 bitter
 tears
 of
 remorse
 and
 gnash
 his
 teeth
 in
 impotent
 despair
 THE
 NEED
 OF
 WATCHFULNESS
 AND
 DILIGENCE
 ILLUSTRATED
 BY
 PARABLES
 To
 more
 indelibly
 impress
 upon
 the
 apostles
 and
 through
 their
 subsequent
 ministry
 upon
 the
 world
 the
 absolute
 need
 of
 unceasing
 watchfulness
 and
 unwavering
 diligence
 in
 preparation
 for
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Lord
 in
 judgment
 Jesus
 depicted
 in
 parables
 the
 prospective
 condition
 of
 mankind
 in
 the
 last
 times
 The
 first
 of
 these
 illustrative
 portrayals
 is
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Ten
 Virgins
 The
 only
 report
 of
 it
 we
 have
 is
 that
 given
 by
 Matthew
 as
 follows
 Then
 shall
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 be
 likened
 unto
 ten
 virgins
 which
 took
 their
 lamps
 and
 went
 forth
 to
 meet
 the
 bridegroom
 And
 five
 of
 them
 were
 wise
 and
 five
 were
 foolish
 They
 that
 were
 foolish
 took
 their
 lamps
 and
 took
 no
 oil
 with
 them
 but
 the
 wise
 took
 oil
 in
 their
 vessels
 with
 their
 lamps
 While
 the
 bridegroom
 tarried
 they
 all
 slumbered
 and
 slept
 And
 at
 midnight
 there
 was
 a
 cry
 made
 Behold
 the
 bridegroom
 cometh
 go
 ye
 out
 to
 meet
 him
 Then
 all
 those
 virgins
 arose
 and
 trimmed
 their
 lamps
 And
 the
 foolish
 said
 unto
 the
 wise
 Give
 us
 of
 your
 oil
 for
 our
 lamps
 are
 gone
 out
 But
 the
 wise
 answered
 saying
 Not
 so
 lest
 there
 be
 not
 enough
 for
 us
 and
 you
 but
 go
 ye
 rather
 to
 them
 that
 sell
 and
 buy
 for
 yourselves
 And
 while
 they
 went
 to
 buy
 the
 bridegroom
 came
 and
 they
 that
 were
 ready
 went
 in
 with
 him
 to
 the
 marriage
 and
 the
 door
 was
 shut
 Afterward
 came
 also
 the
 other
 virgins
 saying
 Lord
 Lord
 open
 to
 us
 But
 he
 answered
 and
 said
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 I
 know
 you
 not
 Watch
 therefore
 for
 ye
 know
 neither
 the
 day
 nor
 the
 hour
 wherein
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 cometh
 The
 story
 itself
 is
 based
 on
 oriental
 marriage
 customs
 with
 which
 the
 Lords
 attentive
 listeners
 were
 familiar
 It
 was
 and
 yet
 is
 common
 in
 those
 lands
 particularly
 in
 connection
 with
 marriage
 festivities
 among
 the
 wealthy
 classes
 for
 the
 bridegroom
 to
 go
 to
 the
 home
 of
 the
 bride
 accompanied
 by
 his
 friends
 in
 processional
 array
 and
 later
 to
 conduct
 the
 bride
 to
 her
 new
 home
 with
 a
 larger
 body
 of
 attendants
 composed
 of
 groomsmen
 bridesmaids
 relatives
 and
 friends
 As
 the
 bridal
 party
 progressed
 to
 the
 accompaniment
 of
 gladsome
 music
 it
 was
 increased
 by
 little
 groups
 who
 had
 gathered
 in
 waiting
 at
 convenient
 places
 along
 the
 route
 and
 particularly
 near
 the
 end
 of
 the
 course
 where
 organized
 companies
 came
 forth
 to
 meet
 the
 advancing
 procession
 Wedding
 ceremonies
 were
 appointed
 for
 the
 evening
 and
 night
 hours
 and
 the
 necessary
 use
 of
 torches
 and
 lamps
 gave
 brilliancy
 and
 added
 beauty
 to
 the
 scene
 In
 the
 parable
 ten
 maidens
 were
 waiting
 to
 welcome
 and
 join
 in
 with
 the
 bridal
 company
 the
 time
 of
 whose
 arrival
 was
 uncertain
 Each
 had
 her
 lamp
 attached
 to
 the
 end
 of
 a
 rod
 so
 as
 to
 be
 held
 aloft
 in
 the
 festal
 march
 but
 of
 the
 ten
 virgins
 five
 had
 wisely
 carried
 an
 extra
 supply
 of
 oil
 while
 the
 other
 five
 probably
 counting
 on
 no
 great
 delay
 or
 assuming
 that
 they
 would
 be
 able
 to
 borrow
 from
 others
 or
 perchance
 having
 negligently
 given
 no
 thought
 at
 all
 to
 the
 matter
 had
 no
 oil
 except
 the
 one
 filling
 with
 which
 their
 lamps
 had
 been
 supplied
 at
 starting
 The
 bridegroom
 tarried
 and
 the
 waiting
 maidens
 grew
 drowsy
 and
 fell
 asleep
 At
 midnight
 the
 forerunners
 of
 the
 marriage
 party
 loudly
 proclaimed
 the
 bridegrooms
 approach
 and
 cried
 in
 haste
 Go
 ye
 out
 to
 meet
 him
 The
 ten
 maidens
 no
 longer
 sleepy
 but
 eagerly
 active
 set
 to
 work
 to
 trim
 their
 lamps
 then
 the
 wise
 ones
 found
 use
 for
 the
 oil
 in
 their
 flasks
 while
 the
 thoughtless
 five
 bewailed
 their
 destitute
 condition
 for
 their
 lamps
 were
 empty
 and
 they
 had
 no
 oil
 for
 replenishment
 They
 appealed
 to
 their
 wiser
 sisters
 asking
 a
 share
 of
 their
 oil
 but
 these
 declined
 for
 in
 a
 time
 of
 such
 exigency
 to
 give
 of
 their
 store
 would
 have
 been
 to
 render
 themselves
 unfit
 inasmuch
 as
 there
 was
 oil
 enough
 for
 their
 own
 lamps
 only
 Instead
 of
 oil
 they
 could
 impart
 only
 advice
 to
 their
 unfortunate
 sisters
 whom
 they
 directed
 to
 go
 to
 the
 nearest
 shop
 and
 buy
 for
 themselves
 While
 the
 foolish
 virgins
 were
 away
 in
 quest
 of
 oil
 the
 wedding
 party
 passed
 into
 the
 house
 wherein
 the
 feast
 was
 provided
 and
 the
 door
 was
 shut
 against
 all
 tardy
 comers
 In
 time
 the
 unwise
 maidens
 too
 late
 to
 participate
 in
 the
 processional
 entry
 called
 from
 without
 pleading
 for
 admittance
 but
 the
 bridegroom
 refused
 their
 request
 and
 disclaimed
 all
 acquaintanceship
 with
 them
 since
 they
 had
 not
 been
 numbered
 among
 his
 attendants
 or
 those
 of
 the
 bride
 The
 Bridegroom
 is
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 the
 marriage
 feast
 symbolizes
 His
 coming
 in
 glory
 to
 receive
 unto
 Himself
 the
 Church
 on
 earth
 as
 His
 bride
 The
 virgins
 typify
 those
 who
 profess
 a
 belief
 in
 Christ
 and
 who
 therefore
 confidently
 expect
 to
 be
 included
 among
 the
 blessed
 participants
 at
 the
 feast
 The
 lighted
 lamp
 which
 each
 of
 the
 maidens
 carried
 is
 the
 outward
 profession
 of
 Christian
 belief
 and
 practise
 and
 in
 the
 oil
 reserves
 of
 the
 wiser
 ones
 we
 may
 see
 the
 spiritual
 strength
 and
 abundance
 which
 diligence
 and
 devotion
 in
 Gods
 service
 alone
 can
 insure
 The
 lack
 of
 sufficient
 oil
 on
 the
 part
 of
 the
 unwise
 virgins
 is
 analogous
 to
 the
 dearth
 of
 soil
 in
 the
 stony
 field
 wherein
 the
 seed
 readily
 sprouted
 but
 soon
 withered
 away
 The
 Bridegrooms
 coming
 was
 sudden
 yet
 the
 waiting
 virgins
 were
 not
 held
 blamable
 for
 their
 surprize
 at
 the
 abrupt
 announcement
 but
 the
 unwise
 five
 suffered
 the
 natural
 results
 of
 their
 unpreparedness
 The
 refusal
 of
 the
 wise
 virgins
 to
 give
 of
 their
 oil
 at
 such
 a
 critical
 time
 must
 not
 be
 regarded
 as
 uncharitable
 the
 circumstance
 typifies
 the
 fact
 that
 in
 the
 day
 of
 judgment
 every
 soul
 must
 answer
 for
 himself
 there
 is
 no
 way
 by
 which
 the
 righteousness
 of
 one
 can
 be
 credited
 to
 anothers
 account
 the
 doctrine
 of
 supererogation
 is
 wholly
 false
 The
 Bridegrooms
 condemnatory
 disclaimer
 I
 know
 you
 not
 was
 equivalent
 to
 a
 declaration
 that
 the
 imploring
 but
 neglectful
 ones
 who
 had
 been
 found
 unready
 and
 unprepared
 did
 not
 know
 Him
 The
 application
 of
 the
 parable
 and
 its
 wealth
 of
 splendid
 suggestion
 are
 summarized
 in
 a
 masterly
 manner
 by
 the
 Lords
 impressive
 adjuration
 Watch
 therefore
 for
 ye
 know
 neither
 the
 day
 nor
 the
 hour
 wherein
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 cometh
 The
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 predictions
 enshrined
 in
 this
 precious
 parable
 is
 yet
 future
 but
 near
 In
 
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 Christ
 revealed
 anew
 the
 indications
 by
 which
 the
 imminence
 of
 His
 glorious
 advent
 may
 be
 perceived
 Through
 the
 mouth
 of
 His
 prophet
 Joseph
 Smith
 He
 thus
 spake
 And
 at
 that
 day
 when
 I
 shall
 come
 in
 my
 glory
 shall
 the
 parable
 be
 fulfilled
 which
 I
 spake
 concerning
 the
 ten
 virgins
 for
 they
 that
 are
 wise
 and
 have
 received
 the
 truth
 and
 have
 taken
 the
 Holy
 Spirit
 for
 their
 guide
 and
 have
 not
 been
 deceived
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 they
 shall
 not
 be
 hewn
 down
 and
 cast
 into
 the
 fire
 but
 shall
 abide
 the
 day
 and
 the
 earth
 shall
 be
 given
 unto
 them
 for
 an
 inheritance
 and
 they
 shall
 multiply
 and
 wax
 strong
 and
 their
 children
 shall
 grow
 up
 without
 sin
 unto
 salvation
 for
 the
 Lord
 shall
 be
 in
 their
 midst
 and
 his
 glory
 shall
 be
 upon
 them
 and
 he
 will
 be
 their
 King
 and
 their
 Lawgiver
 Still
 discoursing
 in
 solemn
 earnestness
 to
 the
 apostles
 as
 the
 evening
 shadows
 gathered
 about
 the
 Mount
 of
 Olives
 the
 Lord
 delivered
 the
 last
 of
 His
 recorded
 parables
 We
 call
 it
 the
 Parable
 of
 the
 Entrusted
 Talents
 For
 the
 kingdom
 of
 heaven
 is
 as
 a
 man
 travelling
 into
 a
 far
 country
 who
 called
 his
 own
 servants
 and
 delivered
 unto
 them
 his
 goods
 And
 unto
 one
 he
 gave
 five
 talents
 to
 another
 two
 and
 to
 another
 one
 to
 every
 man
 according
 to
 his
 several
 ability
 and
 straightway
 took
 his
 journey
 Then
 he
 that
 had
 received
 the
 five
 talents
 went
 and
 traded
 with
 the
 same
 and
 made
 them
 other
 five
 talents
 And
 likewise
 he
 that
 had
 received
 two
 he
 also
 gained
 other
 two
 But
 he
 that
 had
 received
 one
 went
 and
 digged
 in
 the
 earth
 and
 hid
 his
 lords
 money
 After
 a
 long
 time
 the
 lord
 of
 those
 servants
 cometh
 and
 reckoneth
 with
 them
 And
 so
 he
 that
 had
 received
 five
 talents
 came
 and
 brought
 other
 five
 talents
 saying
 Lord
 thou
 deliveredst
 unto
 me
 five
 talents
 behold
 I
 have
 gained
 beside
 them
 five
 talents
 more
 His
 lord
 said
 unto
 him
 Well
 done
 thou
 good
 and
 faithful
 servant
 thou
 hast
 been
 faithful
 over
 a
 few
 things
 I
 will
 make
 thee
 ruler
 over
 many
 things
 enter
 thou
 into
 the
 joy
 of
 thy
 lord
 He
 also
 that
 had
 received
 two
 talents
 came
 and
 said
 Lord
 thou
 deliveredst
 unto
 me
 two
 talents
 behold
 I
 have
 gained
 two
 other
 talents
 beside
 them
 His
 lord
 said
 unto
 him
 Well
 done
 good
 and
 faithful
 servant
 thou
 hast
 been
 faithful
 over
 a
 few
 things
 I
 will
 make
 thee
 ruler
 over
 many
 things
 enter
 thou
 into
 the
 joy
 of
 thy
 lord
 Then
 he
 which
 had
 received
 the
 one
 talent
 came
 and
 said
 Lord
 I
 knew
 thee
 that
 thou
 art
 an
 hard
 man
 reaping
 where
 thou
 hast
 not
 sown
 and
 gathering
 where
 thou
 hast
 not
 strawed
 And
 I
 was
 afraid
 and
 went
 and
 hid
 thy
 talent
 in
 the
 earth
 lo
 there
 thou
 hast
 that
 is
 thine
 His
 lord
 answered
 and
 said
 unto
 him
 Thou
 wicked
 and
 slothful
 servant
 thou
 knewest
 that
 I
 reap
 where
 I
 sowed
 not
 and
 gather
 where
 I
 have
 not
 strawed
 Thou
 oughtest
 therefore
 to
 have
 put
 my
 money
 to
 the
 exchangers
 and
 then
 at
 my
 coming
 I
 should
 have
 received
 mine
 own
 with
 usury
 Take
 therefore
 the
 talent
 from
 him
 and
 give
 it
 unto
 him
 which
 hath
 ten
 talents
 For
 unto
 every
 one
 that
 hath
 shall
 be
 given
 and
 he
 shall
 have
 abundance
 but
 from
 him
 that
 hath
 not
 shall
 be
 taken
 away
 even
 that
 which
 he
 hath
 And
 cast
 ye
 the
 unprofitable
 servant
 into
 outer
 darkness
 there
 shall
 be
 weeping
 and
 gnashing
 of
 teeth
 Some
 of
 the
 resemblances
 between
 this
 parable
 and
 that
 of
 the
 Pounds
 appear
 on
 even
 a
 casual
 reading
 significant
 differences
 are
 discovered
 by
 comparison
 and
 study
 The
 earlier
 parable
 was
 spoken
 to
 a
 mixed
 multitude
 in
 the
 course
 of
 our
 Lords
 last
 journey
 from
 Jericho
 to
 Jerusalem
 the
 later
 one
 was
 given
 in
 privacy
 to
 the
 most
 intimate
 of
 His
 disciples
 in
 the
 closing
 hours
 of
 the
 last
 day
 of
 His
 public
 preaching
 The
 two
 should
 be
 studied
 together
 In
 the
 story
 of
 the
 Pounds
 an
 equal
 amount
 of
 capital
 is
 given
 to
 each
 of
 the
 servants
 and
 mens
 diverse
 ability
 to
 use
 and
 apply
 with
 commensurate
 results
 in
 reward
 or
 penalty
 is
 demonstrated
 in
 that
 of
 the
 Entrusted
 Talents
 the
 servants
 receive
 different
 amounts
 every
 man
 according
 to
 his
 several
 ability
 and
 equal
 diligence
 though
 shown
 in
 one
 instance
 by
 great
 gain
 and
 in
 the
 other
 by
 small
 but
 proportionate
 increase
 is
 equally
 rewarded
 Unfaithfulness
 and
 negligence
 are
 condemned
 and
 punished
 in
 both
 In
 the
 parable
 now
 under
 consideration
 the
 master
 is
 presented
 as
 delivering
 his
 wealth
 into
 the
 hands
 of
 his
 own
 servants
 literally
 bondservants
 they
 as
 well
 as
 the
 possessions
 held
 by
 them
 in
 trust
 were
 his
 Those
 servants
 had
 no
 rights
 of
 actual
 ownership
 nor
 title
 of
 permanent
 proprietorship
 in
 the
 treasure
 committed
 to
 their
 care
 all
 they
 had
 the
 time
 and
 opportunity
 to
 use
 their
 talents
 and
 they
 themselves
 belonged
 to
 their
 lord
 We
 cannot
 fail
 to
 perceive
 even
 in
 the
 early
 incidents
 of
 the
 story
 that
 the
 Master
 of
 the
 servants
 was
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 the
 servants
 therefore
 were
 the
 disciples
 and
 more
 particularly
 the
 apostles
 who
 while
 of
 equal
 authority
 through
 ordination
 in
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 as
 specifically
 illustrated
 by
 the
 earlier
 parable
 of
 the
 Pounds
 were
 of
 varied
 ability
 of
 diverse
 personality
 and
 unequal
 generally
 in
 nature
 and
 in
 such
 accomplishments
 as
 would
 be
 called
 into
 service
 throughout
 their
 ministry
 The
 Lord
 was
 about
 to
 depart
 He
 would
 return
 only
 after
 a
 long
 time
 the
 significance
 of
 this
 latter
 circumstance
 is
 in
 line
 with
 that
 expressed
 through
 the
 parable
 of
 the
 Ten
 Virgins
 in
 the
 statement
 that
 the
 Bridegroom
 tarried
 At
 the
 time
 of
 reckoning
 the
 servants
 who
 had
 done
 well
 the
 one
 with
 his
 five
 talents
 the
 other
 with
 his
 two
 reported
 gladly
 conscious
 as
 they
 were
 of
 having
 at
 least
 striven
 to
 do
 their
 best
 The
 unfaithful
 servant
 prefaced
 his
 report
 with
 a
 grumbling
 excuse
 which
 involved
 the
 imputation
 of
 unrighteousness
 in
 the
 Master
 The
 honest
 diligent
 faithful
 servants
 saw
 and
 reverenced
 in
 their
 Lord
 the
 perfection
 of
 the
 good
 qualities
 which
 they
 possessed
 in
 measured
 degree
 the
 lazy
 and
 unprofitable
 serf
 afflicted
 by
 distorted
 vision
 professed
 to
 see
 in
 the
 Master
 his
 own
 base
 defects
 The
 story
 in
 this
 particular
 as
 in
 the
 other
 features
 relating
 to
 human
 acts
 and
 tendencies
 is
 psychologically
 true
 in
 a
 peculiar
 sense
 men
 are
 prone
 to
 conceive
 of
 the
 attributes
 of
 God
 as
 comprizing
 in
 augmented
 degree
 the
 dominant
 traits
 of
 their
 own
 nature
 Both
 the
 servant
 who
 had
 been
 entrusted
 with
 five
 talents
 and
 he
 who
 had
 received
 but
 two
 were
 equally
 commended
 and
 as
 far
 as
 we
 are
 told
 were
 equally
 recompensed
 The
 talents
 bestowed
 upon
 each
 were
 the
 gift
 of
 his
 Lord
 who
 knew
 well
 whether
 that
 servant
 was
 capable
 of
 using
 to
 better
 advantage
 one
 two
 or
 five
 Let
 no
 one
 conclude
 that
 good
 work
 of
 relatively
 small
 scope
 is
 less
 necessary
 or
 acceptable
 than
 like
 service
 of
 wider
 range
 Many
 a
 man
 who
 has
 succeeded
 well
 in
 business
 with
 small
 capital
 would
 have
 failed
 in
 the
 administration
 of
 vast
 sums
 so
 also
 in
 spiritual
 achievements
 there
 are
 diversities
 of
 gifts
 but
 the
 same
 Spirit
 Of
 the
 man
 endowed
 with
 many
 talents
 greater
 returns
 were
 expected
 of
 the
 onetalented
 man
 relatively
 little
 was
 required
 yet
 in
 that
 little
 he
 failed
 At
 the
 least
 he
 could
 have
 delivered
 the
 money
 to
 the
 bank
 through
 which
 it
 would
 have
 been
 kept
 in
 circulation
 to
 the
 benefit
 of
 the
 community
 and
 would
 have
 earned
 interest
 meanwhile
 Likewise
 in
 the
 spiritual
 application
 a
 man
 possessed
 of
 any
 good
 gift
 such
 as
 musical
 ability
 eloquence
 skill
 in
 handicraft
 or
 the
 like
 ought
 to
 use
 that
 gift
 to
 the
 full
 that
 he
 or
 others
 may
 be
 profited
 thereby
 but
 should
 he
 be
 too
 neglectful
 to
 exercize
 his
 powers
 in
 independent
 service
 he
 may
 assist
 others
 to
 profitable
 effort
 by
 encouragement
 if
 by
 nothing
 more
 Who
 can
 doubt
 in
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 Lords
 teaching
 that
 had
 the
 man
 been
 able
 to
 report
 the
 doubling
 of
 his
 single
 talent
 he
 would
 have
 been
 as
 cordially
 commended
 and
 as
 richly
 recompensed
 as
 were
 his
 more
 highly
 endowed
 and
 faithful
 fellows
 It
 is
 notable
 that
 to
 the
 charge
 of
 unrighteousness
 made
 by
 the
 unfaithful
 servant
 the
 Lord
 deigns
 no
 refutation
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 reply
 was
 the
 same
 as
 that
 expressed
 in
 the
 earlier
 parable
 Out
 of
 thine
 own
 mouth
 will
 I
 judge
 thee
 thou
 wicked
 servant
 The
 unworthy
 man
 sought
 to
 excuse
 himself
 by
 the
 despicable
 but
 all
 too
 common
 subterfuge
 of
 presumptuously
 charging
 culpability
 in
 another
 and
 in
 this
 instance
 that
 other
 was
 his
 Lord
 Talents
 are
 not
 given
 to
 be
 buried
 and
 then
 to
 be
 dug
 up
 and
 offered
 back
 unimproved
 reeking
 with
 the
 smell
 of
 earth
 and
 dulled
 by
 the
 corrosion
 of
 disuse
 The
 unused
 talent
 was
 justly
 taken
 from
 him
 who
 had
 counted
 it
 as
 of
 so
 little
 worth
 and
 was
 given
 to
 one
 who
 although
 possessing
 much
 would
 use
 the
 additional
 gift
 to
 his
 own
 profit
 to
 the
 betterment
 of
 his
 fellows
 and
 to
 the
 glory
 of
 his
 Lord
 THE
 INEVITABLE
 JUDGMENT
 The
 Lord
 had
 uttered
 His
 last
 parable
 In
 words
 of
 plainness
 though
 suffused
 with
 the
 beauty
 of
 effective
 simile
 He
 impressed
 upon
 the
 listening
 disciples
 the
 certainty
 of
 judgment
 by
 which
 the
 world
 shall
 be
 visited
 in
 the
 day
 of
 His
 appearing
 Then
 shall
 the
 wheat
 be
 segregated
 from
 the
 tares
 and
 the
 sheep
 divided
 from
 the
 goats
 When
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 shall
 come
 in
 his
 glory
 and
 all
 the
 holy
 angels
 with
 him
 then
 shall
 he
 sit
 upon
 the
 throne
 of
 his
 glory
 And
 before
 him
 shall
 be
 gathered
 all
 nations
 and
 he
 shall
 separate
 them
 one
 from
 another
 as
 a
 shepherd
 divideth
 his
 sheep
 from
 the
 goats
 And
 he
 shall
 set
 the
 sheep
 on
 his
 right
 hand
 but
 the
 goats
 on
 the
 left
 Unto
 those
 on
 His
 right
 hand
 the
 King
 shall
 give
 commendation
 and
 blessing
 bestowing
 a
 rich
 recompense
 for
 their
 good
 works
 as
 attested
 by
 the
 hungry
 they
 had
 fed
 the
 thirsty
 to
 whom
 they
 had
 given
 drink
 the
 stranger
 they
 had
 lodged
 the
 naked
 they
 had
 clothed
 the
 sick
 to
 whom
 they
 had
 ministered
 the
 prisoners
 they
 had
 visited
 and
 encouraged
 all
 of
 which
 mercies
 are
 accredited
 to
 them
 as
 having
 been
 rendered
 to
 their
 Lord
 in
 person
 The
 blessed
 company
 overwhelmed
 by
 the
 plenitude
 of
 the
 Kings
 bounty
 of
 which
 they
 regard
 themselves
 as
 undeserving
 will
 fain
 disclaim
 the
 merit
 attributed
 to
 them
 And
 the
 King
 shall
 answer
 and
 say
 unto
 them
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Inasmuch
 as
 ye
 have
 done
 it
 unto
 one
 of
 the
 least
 of
 these
 my
 brethren
 ye
 have
 done
 it
 unto
 me
 Unto
 them
 who
 wait
 on
 the
 left
 in
 terrified
 expectancy
 the
 King
 shall
 recount
 their
 several
 deficiencies
 in
 that
 they
 had
 given
 Him
 neither
 food
 nor
 drink
 shelter
 nor
 clothing
 despite
 His
 need
 neither
 had
 they
 visited
 Him
 though
 ill
 nor
 ministered
 unto
 His
 wants
 when
 He
 lay
 in
 a
 prison
 cell
 In
 the
 desperation
 of
 anguish
 these
 shall
 ask
 when
 and
 where
 they
 had
 had
 such
 opportunity
 of
 comforting
 Him
 and
 He
 shall
 answer
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Inasmuch
 as
 ye
 did
 it
 not
 to
 one
 of
 the
 least
 of
 these
 ye
 did
 it
 not
 to
 me
 The
 righteous
 shall
 be
 welcomed
 with
 Come
 ye
 blessed
 of
 my
 Father
 the
 wicked
 shall
 hear
 the
 awful
 sentence
 Depart
 from
 me
 ye
 cursed
 Eternal
 life
 is
 the
 inestimable
 reward
 everlasting
 punishment
 the
 unfathomable
 doom
 Viewing
 as
 one
 discourse
 the
 two
 parables
 and
 the
 teaching
 that
 directly
 followed
 we
 find
 in
 it
 such
 unity
 of
 subject
 and
 thoroughness
 of
 treatment
 as
 to
 give
 to
 the
 whole
 both
 beauty
 and
 worth
 beyond
 the
 sum
 of
 these
 qualities
 exhibited
 in
 the
 several
 parts
 Vigilant
 waiting
 in
 the
 Lords
 cause
 and
 the
 dangers
 of
 unreadiness
 are
 exemplified
 in
 the
 story
 of
 the
 virgins
 diligence
 in
 work
 and
 the
 calamitous
 results
 of
 sloth
 are
 prominent
 features
 of
 the
 tale
 of
 the
 talents
 These
 two
 phases
 of
 service
 are
 of
 reciprocal
 and
 complementary
 import
 it
 is
 as
 necessary
 at
 times
 to
 wait
 as
 at
 others
 to
 work
 The
 lapse
 of
 a
 long
 period
 as
 while
 the
 Bridegroom
 tarried
 and
 as
 during
 the
 Masters
 absence
 in
 a
 far
 country
 is
 made
 plain

 as

 departure

 in
 glory
 The

 of
 the
 Christ
 coming
 to
 execute
 judgment
 upon
 the
 earth
 in

 which
 every
 soul
 shall
 receive
 according

 ANOTHER
 SPECIFIC
 PREDICTION
 OF
 THE
 LORDS
 DEATH
 Following
 the
 instructions
 to
 the
 apostles
 at
 the
 resting
 place
 on
 Olivet
 and
 probably
 in
 the
 course
 of
 the
 continued
 walk
 toward
 Bethany
 that
 evening
 Jesus
 reminded
 the
 Twelve
 of
 the
 awful
 fate
 awaiting
 Him
 and
 specified
 the
 time
 of
 His
 betrayal
 and
 the
 manner
 of
 His
 death
 Ye
 know
 He
 said
 that
 after
 two
 days
 is
 the
 feast
 of
 the
 passover
 and
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 is
 betrayed
 to
 be
 crucified

 Early
 Fulfilment
 of
 the
 Lords
 PropheciesAs
 to
 the
 literal
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 Lords
 predictions
 relating
 to
 the
 times
 immediately
 following
 His
 ascension
 and
 down
 to
 the
 destruction
 of
 Jerusalem
 the
 student
 must
 be
 referred
 to
 scriptural
 and
 other
 history
 Only
 a
 brief
 summary
 of
 the
 most
 notable
 events
 can
 be
 attempted
 here
 On
 the
 matter
 of
 wars
 and
 rumors
 or
 threats
 of
 wars
 see
 Josephus
 Antiquities
 xviii
 ch
 
 and
 Wars
 ii
 ch
 
 The
 latter
 reference
 is
 to
 the
 account
 of
 the
 decree
 issued
 by
 Caligula
 that
 his
 statue
 be
 set
 up
 and
 duly
 reverenced
 in
 the
 temple
 in
 consequence
 of
 which
 the
 Jews
 protested
 so
 strenuously
 that
 war
 was
 declared
 against
 them
 but
 was
 averted
 by
 the
 death
 of
 the
 emperor
 Concerning
 the
 death
 of
 Caligula
 Josephus
 remarks
 that
 it
 happened
 most
 happily
 for
 our
 nation
 in
 particular
 which
 would
 have
 almost
 utterly
 perished
 if
 he
 had
 not
 been
 suddenly
 slain
 Other
 threats
 of
 war
 against
 the
 Jews
 were
 severally
 made
 by
 the
 emperors
 Claudius
 and
 Nero
 Nation
 rose
 against
 nation
 as
 for
 example
 in
 the
 assault
 of
 Greeks
 and
 Syrians
 upon
 the
 Jews
 in
 the
 course
 of
 which
 
 Jews
 were
 slain
 at
 Selucia
 on
 the
 Tigris
 and
 
 at
 Csarea
 
 at
 Scythopolis
 and
 
 at
 Ascalon
 Famine
 and
 its
 attendant
 pestilence
 prevailed
 during
 the
 reign
 of
 Claudius
 
 AD
 and
 such
 had
 been
 specifically
 predicted
 by
 inspiration
 through
 Agabus
 Acts
 
 The
 famine
 was
 very
 severe
 in
 Palestine
 Josephus
 Antiquities
 xx
 ch
 
 Earthquakes
 were
 of
 alarming
 frequency
 and
 of
 unusual
 severity
 between
 the
 death
 of
 Christ
 and
 the
 destruction
 of
 Jerusalem
 particularly
 in
 Syria
 Macedonia
 Campania
 and
 Achia
 See
 Tacitus
 Annals
 books
 xii
 and
 xiv
 and
 for
 account
 of
 violent
 seismic
 disturbances
 at
 Rome
 see
 Suetonius
 in
 his
 Life

 Josephus

 records
 a
 particularly
 severe
 earthquake
 that
 disrupted
 parts
 of
 Judea
 and
 was
 accompanied
 by
 amazing
 concussions
 and
 bellowings
 of
 the
 eartha
 manifest
 indication
 that
 some
 destruction
 was
 coming
 upon
 men
 The
 portent
 of
 fearful
 sights
 and
 great
 signs
 from
 heaven
 as
 recorded
 by
 Luke
 was
 realized
 in
 the
 phenomenal
 events
 chronicled
 by
 Josephus
 Preface
 to
 Wars
 Of
 the
 persecution
 that
 befell
 the
 apostles
 and
 others
 and
 of
 their
 arraignment
 before
 rulers
 Dr
 Adam
 Clarke
 in
 his
 commentary
 on
 passages
 in
 Matt
 
 says
 We
 need
 go
 no
 farther
 than
 the
 Acts
 of
 the
 Apostles
 for
 the
 completion
 of
 these
 particulars
 Some
 were
 delivered
 to
 councils
 as
 Peter
 and
 John
 Acts
 
 Some
 were
 brought
 before
 rulers
 and
 kings
 as
 Paul
 before
 Gallio
 
 before
 Felix
 ch
 
 before
 Festus
 and
 Agrippa
 ch
 
 Some
 had
 utterance
 and
 wisdom
 which
 their
 adversaries
 were
 not
 able
 to
 resist
 so
 Stephen
 
 and
 Paul
 who
 made
 even
 Felix
 himself
 tremble
 
 Some
 were
 imprisoned
 as
 Peter
 and
 John
 
 Some
 were
 beaten
 as
 Paul
 and
 Silas
 
 Some
 were
 put
 to
 death
 as
 Stephen
 
 and
 James
 the
 brother
 of
 John
 
 But
 if
 we
 look
 beyond
 the
 book
 of
 the
 Acts
 of
 the
 Apostles
 to
 the
 bloody
 persecutions
 under
 Nero
 we
 shall
 find
 these
 predictions
 still
 more
 amply
 fulfilled
 in
 these
 numberless
 Christians
 fell
 besides
 those
 two
 champions
 of
 the
 faith
 Peter
 and
 Paul
 And
 it
 was
 as
 says
 Tertullian
 a
 war
 against
 the
 very
 name
 of
 Christ
 for
 he
 who
 was
 called
 Christian
 had
 committed
 crime
 enough
 in
 bearing
 the
 name
 to
 be
 put
 to
 death
 So
 true
 were
 our
 Saviors
 words
 that
 they
 should
 be
 hated
 of
 all
 men
 for
 His
 Names
 sake
 Among
 the
 false
 prophets
 and
 men
 who
 claimed
 to
 be
 the
 duly
 accredited
 ministers
 of
 Christ
 were
 Simon
 Magus
 who
 drew
 many
 people
 after
 him
 Acts
 
 
 
 see

 The
 Great
 Apostasy
 
 
 Menander
 Dositheus
 and
 Theudas
 and

 false
 apostles

 to
 by
 Paul
 
 Cor
 
 and
 others
 such
 as
 Hymeneus
 and
 Philetus
 
 Tim
 
 
 Dummelows
 Commentary
 applies
 here
 the
 record
 by
 Josephus
 concerning
 a
 body
 of
 wicked
 men
 who
 deceived
 and
 deluded
 the
 people
 under
 pretense
 of
 divine
 inspiration
 who
 prevailed
 with
 the
 multitude
 to
 act
 like
 madmen
 and
 went
 before
 them
 into
 the
 wilderness
 pretending
 that
 God
 would
 there
 show
 them
 the
 signals
 of
 victory
 Compare
 
 Peter
 
 
 John
 
 
 That
 the
 love
 of
 many
 did
 wax
 cold
 both
 before
 and
 after
 the
 destruction
 of
 Jerusalem
 is
 attested
 by
 the
 facts
 of
 the
 worldwide
 apostasy
 which
 was
 the
 result
 of
 corruption
 within
 and
 persecution
 from
 without
 the
 Church
 see
 The
 Great
 Apostasy
 chaps
 
 The
 preaching
 of
 the
 gospel
 of
 the
 kingdom
 in
 all
 the
 world
 was
 no
 less
 truly
 an
 essential
 characteristic
 of
 the
 apostolic
 period
 than
 it
 is
 of
 the
 current
 or
 last
 dispensation
 The
 rapid
 spread
 of
 the
 gospel
 and
 the
 phenomenal
 growth
 of
 the
 Church
 under
 the
 direction
 of
 the
 apostles
 of
 old
 is
 recorded
 as
 one
 of
 the
 marvels
 of
 history

 years
 after

 creature

 The
 abomination
 of
 desolation
 cited
 by
 the
 Lord
 from
 the
 prophecy
 by
 Daniel
 was
 strictly
 fulfilled
 in
 the
 investment
 of
 Jerusalem
 by
 the
 Roman
 army
 compare
 Luke
 
 
 To
 the
 Jews
 the
 ensigns
 and
 images
 of
 the
 Romans
 were
 a
 disgusting
 abomination
 Josephus
 Wars
 vi
 ch
 
 states
 that
 the
 Roman
 ensigns
 were
 set
 up
 inside
 the
 temple
 and
 that
 the
 soldiery
 offered
 sacrifices
 before
 them
 The
 warning
 to
 all
 to
 flee
 from
 Jerusalem
 and
 Judea
 to
 the
 mountains
 when
 the
 armies
 would
 begin
 to
 surround
 the
 city
 was
 so
 generally
 heeded
 by
 members
 of
 the
 Church
 that
 according
 to
 the
 early
 Church
 writers
 not
 one
 Christian
 perished
 in
 the
 awful
 siege
 see
 Eusebius
 Eccles
 Hist
 book
 iii
 ch
 
 The
 first
 siege
 by
 Gallus
 was
 unexpectedly
 raised
 and

 armies
 of
 Vespasian
 arrived
 at
 the
 walls
 all
 Jews
 who
 had
 faith
 in
 the
 warning
 given
 by
 Christ
 to
 the
 apostles
 and
 by
 these
 to
 the
 people
 fled
 beyond
 Jordan

 congregated

 Many
 tens
 of
 thousands
 were
 taken
 captive
 to
 be
 afterward
 sold
 into
 slavery
 or
 to
 be
 slain
 by
 wild
 beasts
 or
 in
 gladiatorial
 combat
 in
 the
 arena
 for
 the
 amusement
 of
 Roman
 spectators
 In
 the
 course
 of
 the
 siege
 a
 wall
 was
 constructed
 about
 the
 entire
 city
 thus
 fulfilling
 the
 Lords
 prediction
 Luke
 
 thine
 enemies
 shall
 cast
 a
 trench
 about
 thee
 in
 which
 by
 the
 admittedly
 better
 translation
 bank
 or
 palisade
 should
 appear
 instead
 of
 trench
 In
 September
 AD
 
 the
 city
 fell
 into
 the
 hands
 of
 the
 Romans
 and
 its
 destruction
 was
 afterward
 made
 so
 thorough
 that
 its
 site
 was
 plowed
 up
 Jerusalem
 was
 trodden
 down
 of
 the
 Gentiles
 and
 ever
 since
 has
 been
 under
 Gentile
 dominion
 and
 so
 shall
 continue
 to
 be
 until
 the
 times
 of
 the
 Gentiles
 be
 fulfilled
 Luke
 
 
 In
 the
 Deserts
 and
 in
 Secret
 ChambersThe
 th
 chapter
 of
 Matthew
 and
 its
 parallel
 scriptures
 in
 Mark
 
 and
 Luke
 
 may
 be
 the
 more
 easily
 understood
 if
 we
 bear
 in
 mind
 that
 the
 Lord
 therein
 speaks
 of
 two
 distinct
 events
 each
 a
 consummation
 of
 long
 ages
 of
 preparation
 and
 the
 first
 a
 prototype
 of
 the
 second
 Many
 of
 the
 specific
 predictions
 are
 applicable
 both
 to
 the
 time
 preceding
 or
 at
 the
 destruction
 of
 Jerusalem
 and
 to
 developments
 of
 succeeding
 time
 down
 to
 the
 second
 coming
 of
 Christ
 The
 passage
 in
 Matt
 
 may
 be
 given
 this
 twofold
 application
 Josephus
 tells
 of
 men
 leading
 others
 away
 into
 the
 desert
 saying
 under
 pretended
 inspiration
 that
 there
 should
 they
 find
 God
 and
 the
 same
 historian
 mentions
 a
 false
 prophet
 who
 led
 many
 into
 the
 secret
 chambers
 of
 the
 temple
 during
 the
 Roman
 assault
 promising
 them
 that
 there
 would
 the
 Lord
 give
 them
 deliverance
 Men
 women
 and
 children
 followed
 this
 fanatical
 leader
 and
 were
 caught
 in
 the
 holocaust
 of
 destruction
 so
 that
 
 of
 them
 perished
 in
 the
 flames
 Josephus
 Wars
 vi
 ch
 
 Concerning
 an
 application
 of
 the
 Lords
 precepts
 to
 later
 times
 and
 conditions
 the
 author
 has
 elsewhere
 written
 The
 Great
 Apostasy
 
 One
 of
 the
 heresies
 of
 early
 origin
 and
 rapid
 growth
 in
 the
 Church
 was
 the
 doctrine
 of
 antagonism
 between
 body
 and
 spirit
 whereby
 the
 former
 was
 regarded
 as
 an
 incubus
 and
 a
 curse
 From
 what
 has
 been
 said
 this
 will
 be
 recognized
 as
 one
 of
 the
 perversions
 derived
 from
 the
 alliance
 of
 Gnosticism
 with
 Christianity
 A
 result
 of
 this
 grafting
 in
 of
 heathen
 doctrines
 was
 an
 abundant
 growth
 of
 hermit
 practises
 by
 which
 men
 sought
 to
 weaken
 torture
 and
 subdue
 their
 bodies
 that
 their
 spirits
 or
 souls
 might
 gain
 greater
 freedom
 Many
 who
 adopted
 this
 unnatural
 view
 of
 human
 existence
 retired
 to
 the
 solitude
 of
 the
 desert
 and
 there
 spent
 their
 time
 in
 practises
 of
 stern
 selfdenial
 and
 in
 acts
 of
 frenzied
 selftorture
 Others
 shut
 themselves
 up
 as
 voluntary
 prisoners
 seeking
 glory
 in
 privation
 and
 selfimposed
 penance
 It
 was
 this
 unnatural
 view
 of
 life
 that
 gave
 rise
 to
 the
 several
 orders
 of
 recluses
 hermits
 and
 monks
 Think
 you
 not
 that
 the
 Savior
 had
 such
 practises
 in
 mind
 when
 warning
 the
 disciples
 of
 the
 false
 claims
 to
 sanctity
 that
 would
 characterize
 the
 times
 then
 soon
 to
 follow
 He
 said
 Wherefore
 if
 they
 shall
 say
 unto
 you
 Behold
 he
 Christ
 is
 in
 the
 desert
 go
 not
 forth
 behold
 he
 is
 in
 the
 secret
 chambers
 believe
 it
 not
 
 The
 Time
 of
 Christs
 Advent
 Not
 KnownThe
 Lords
 statement
 that
 the
 time
 of
 His
 advent
 in
 glory
 was
 unknown
 to
 man
 and
 that
 the
 angels
 knew
 it
 not
 neither
 the
 Son
 but
 that
 it
 was
 known
 to
 the
 Father
 only
 appears
 plain
 and
 unambiguous
 notwithstanding
 many
 and
 conflicting
 commentaries
 thereon
 Jesus
 repeatedly
 affirmed
 that
 His
 mission
 was
 to
 do
 the
 will
 of
 the
 Father
 and
 it
 is
 evident
 that
 the
 Fathers
 will
 was
 revealed
 to
 Him
 from
 time
 to
 time
 While
 in
 the
 flesh
 He
 laid
 no
 claim
 to
 omniscience
 though
 whatever
 He
 willed
 to
 know
 He
 learned
 through
 the
 medium
 of
 communication
 with
 the
 Father
 Christ
 had
 not
 asked
 to
 know
 what
 the
 Father
 had
 not
 intimated
 His
 readiness
 to
 reveal
 which
 in
 this
 instance
 was
 the
 day
 and
 hour
 of
 the
 Sons
 appointed
 return
 to
 earth
 as
 a
 glorified
 resurrected
 Being
 We
 need
 not
 hesitate
 to
 believe
 that
 at
 the
 time
 Jesus
 delivered
 to
 the
 apostles
 the
 discourse
 under
 consideration
 He
 was
 uninformed
 on
 the
 matter
 for
 He
 so
 states
 In
 the
 last
 interview
 between
 Christ
 and
 the
 apostles
 immediately
 before
 His
 ascension
 Acts
 
 
 they
 asked
 Lord
 wilt
 thou
 at
 this
 time
 restore
 again
 the
 kingdom
 to
 Israel
 And
 he
 said
 unto
 them
 It
 is
 not
 for
 you
 to
 know
 the
 times
 or
 the
 seasons
 which
 the
 Father
 hath
 put
 in
 his
 own
 power
 Nor
 has
 the
 date
 of
 the
 Messianic
 consummation
 been
 since
 revealed
 to
 any
 man
 though
 even
 now
 the
 fig
 tree
 is
 rapidly
 putting
 forth
 its
 leaves
 and
 he
 who
 hath
 eyes
 to
 see
 and
 a
 heart
 to
 understand
 knows
 that
 the
 summer
 of
 the
 Lords
 purpose
 is
 near
 at
 hand
 
 The
 False
 Doctrine
 of
 SupererogationAmong
 the
 pernicious
 fallacies
 promulgated
 as
 authorized
 dogmas
 by
 the
 apostate
 church
 during
 the
 long
 period
 of
 spiritual
 darkness
 following
 the
 close
 of
 the
 apostolic
 ministry
 was
 the
 awful
 enormity
 known
 as
 the
 doctrine
 of
 supererogation
 As
 stated
 by
 Mosheim
 Eccl
 Hist
 Cent
 xii
 part
 ii
 ch
 
 the
 dreadful
 doctrine
 was
 formulated
 in
 the
 thirteenth
 century
 as
 follows
 That
 there
 actually
 existed
 an
 immense
 treasure
 of
 merit
 composed
 of
 the
 pious
 deeds
 and
 virtuous
 actions
 which
 the
 saints
 had
 performed
 beyond
 what
 was
 necessary
 for
 their
 own
 salvation
 and
 which
 were
 therefore
 applicable
 to
 the
 benefit
 of
 others
 that
 the
 guardian
 and
 dispenser
 of
 this
 precious
 treasure
 was
 the
 Roman
 pontiff
 and
 that
 of
 consequence
 he
 was
 empowered
 to
 assign
 to
 such
 as
 he
 thought
 proper
 a
 portion
 of
 this
 inexhaustible
 source
 of
 merit
 suitable
 to
 their
 respective
 guilt
 and
 sufficient
 to
 deliver
 them
 from
 the
 punishment
 due
 to
 their
 crimes
 Concerning
 the
 fallacy
 of
 this
 doctrine
 the
 author
 has
 written
 The
 Great
 Apostasy
 
 in
 this
 wise
 This
 doctrine
 of
 supererogation
 is
 as
 unreasonable
 as
 it
 is
 unscriptural
 and
 untrue
 Mans
 individual
 responsibility
 for
 his
 acts
 is
 as
 surely
 a
 fact
 as
 is
 his
 agency
 to
 act
 for
 himself
 He
 will
 be
 saved
 through
 the
 merits
 and
 by
 the
 atoning
 sacrifice
 of
 our
 Redeemer
 and
 Lord
 and
 his
 claim
 upon
 the
 salvation
 provided
 is
 strictly
 dependent
 on
 his
 compliance
 with
 the
 principles
 and
 ordinances
 of
 the
 gospel
 as
 established
 by
 Jesus
 Christ
 Remission
 of
 sins
 and
 the
 eventual
 salvation
 of
 the
 human
 soul
 are
 provided
 for
 but
 these
 gifts
 of
 God
 are
 not
 to
 be
 purchased
 with
 money
 Compare
 the
 awful
 fallacies
 of
 supererogation
 and
 the
 blasphemous
 practise
 of
 assuming
 to
 remit
 the
 sins
 of
 one
 man
 in
 consideration
 of
 the
 merits
 of
 another
 with
 the
 declaration
 of
 the
 one
 and
 only
 Savior
 of
 mankind
 But
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 that
 every
 idle
 word
 that
 men
 shall
 speak
 they
 shall
 give
 an
 account
 thereof
 in
 the
 day
 of
 judgment
 If
 conclusions
 as
 to
 doctrine
 may
 be
 drawn
 from
 our
 Lords
 parables
 the
 parable
 of
 the
 Ten
 Virgins
 affords
 refutation
 of
 the
 Satanic
 suggestion
 that
 one
 mans
 sin
 may
 be
 neutralized
 by
 anothers
 righteousness
 We
 know
 no
 supererogation
 but
 that
 of
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 Christ
 through
 whose
 merits
 salvation
 is
 placed
 within
 the
 reach
 of
 all
 men

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 LAST
 SUPPER
 AND
 THE
 BETRAYAL
 PRIESTLY
 CONSPIRATORS
 AND
 THE
 TRAITOR
 As
 the
 time
 for
 the
 annual
 Feast
 of
 the
 Passover
 approached
 and
 particularly
 during
 the
 two
 days
 immediately
 preceding
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 festival
 the
 chief
 priests
 scribes
 and
 elders
 of
 the
 people
 in
 short
 the
 Sanhedrin
 and
 the
 entire
 priestly
 party
 conspired
 persistently
 together
 as
 to
 the
 best
 manner
 of
 taking
 Jesus
 into
 custody
 and
 putting
 Him
 to
 death
 At
 one
 of
 these
 gatherings
 of
 evil
 counsel
 which
 was
 held
 at
 the
 palace
 of
 the
 high
 priest
 Caiaphas
 it
 was
 decided
 that
 Jesus
 should
 be
 taken
 by
 subtlety
 if
 possible
 as
 the
 probable
 effect
 of
 an
 open
 arrest
 would
 be
 an
 uprising
 of
 the
 people
 The
 rulers
 feared
 especially
 an
 outbreak
 by
 the
 Galileans
 who
 had
 a
 provincial
 pride
 in
 the
 prominence
 of
 Jesus
 as
 one
 of
 their
 countrymen
 and
 many
 of
 whom
 were
 then
 in
 Jerusalem
 It
 was
 further
 concluded
 and
 for
 the
 same
 reasons
 that
 the
 Jewish
 custom
 of
 making
 impressive
 examples
 of
 notable
 offenders
 by
 executing
 public
 punishment
 upon
 them
 at
 times
 of
 great
 general
 assemblages
 be
 set
 aside
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Jesus
 therefore
 the
 conspirators
 said
 Not
 on
 the
 feast
 day
 lest
 there
 be
 an
 uproar
 among
 the
 people
 On
 earlier
 occasions
 they
 had
 made
 futile
 attempts
 to
 get
 Jesus
 into
 their
 hands
 and
 they
 were
 naturally
 dubious
 as
 to
 the
 outcome
 of
 their
 later
 machinations
 At
 this
 juncture
 they
 were
 encouraged
 and
 gladdened
 in
 their
 wicked
 plots
 by
 the
 appearance
 of
 an
 unexpected
 ally
 Judas
 Iscariot
 one
 of
 the
 Twelve
 sought
 an
 audience
 with
 these
 rulers
 of
 the
 Jews
 and
 infamously
 offered
 to
 betray
 his
 Lord
 into
 their
 hands
 Under
 the
 impulse
 of
 diabolic
 avarice
 which
 however
 was
 probably
 but
 a
 secondary
 element
 in
 the
 real
 cause
 of
 his
 perfidious
 treachery
 he
 bargained
 to
 sell
 his
 Master
 for
 money
 and
 chaffered
 with
 the
 priestly
 purchasers
 over
 the
 price
 of
 the
 Saviors
 blood
 What
 will
 ye
 give
 me
 he
 asked
 and
 they
 covenanted
 with
 him
 for
 thirty
 pieces
 of
 silver
 This
 amount
 approximately
 seventeen
 dollars
 in
 our
 money
 but
 of
 many
 times
 greater
 purchasing
 power
 with
 the
 Jews
 in
 that
 day
 than
 now
 with
 us
 was
 the
 price
 fixed
 by
 the
 law
 as
 that
 of
 a
 slave
 it
 was
 also
 the
 foreseen
 sum
 of
 the
 bloodmoney
 to
 be
 paid
 for
 the
 Lords
 betrayal
 That
 the
 silver
 was
 actually
 paid
 to
 Judas
 either
 at
 this
 first
 interview
 or
 at
 some
 later
 meeting
 between
 the
 traitor
 and
 the
 priests
 is
 demonstrated
 by
 after
 events
 He
 had
 pledged
 himself
 to
 the
 blackest
 deed
 of
 treachery
 of
 which
 man
 is
 capable
 and
 from
 that
 hour
 he
 sought
 the
 opportunity
 of
 superseding
 his
 infamous
 promise
 by
 its
 more
 villainous
 fulfilment
 We
 are
 yet
 to
 be
 afflicted
 by
 other
 glimpses
 of
 the
 evilhearted
 Iscariot
 in
 the
 course
 of
 this
 dread
 chronicle
 of
 tragedy
 and
 perdition
 for
 the
 present
 let
 it
 be
 said
 that
 before
 Judas
 sold
 Christ
 to
 the
 Jews
 he
 had
 sold
 himself
 to
 the
 devil
 he
 had
 become
 Satans
 serf
 and
 did
 his
 masters
 bidding
 THE
 LAST
 SUPPER
 The
 day
 preceding
 the
 eating
 of
 the
 passover
 lamb
 had
 come
 to
 be
 known
 among
 the
 Jews
 as
 the
 first
 day
 of
 the
 feast
 of
 unleavened
 bread
 since
 on
 that
 day
 all
 leaven
 had
 to
 be
 removed
 from
 their
 dwellings
 and
 thereafter
 for
 a
 period
 of
 eight
 days
 the
 eating
 of
 anything
 containing
 leaven
 was
 unlawful
 On
 the
 afternoon
 of
 this
 day
 the
 paschal
 lambs
 were
 slain
 within
 the
 temple
 court
 by
 the
 representatives
 of
 families
 or
 companies
 who
 were
 to
 eat
 together
 and
 a
 portion
 of
 the
 blood
 of
 each
 lamb
 was
 sprinkled
 at
 the
 foot
 of
 the
 altar
 of
 sacrifice
 by
 one
 of
 the
 numerous
 priests
 on
 duty
 for
 the
 day
 The
 slain
 lamb
 then
 said
 to
 have
 been
 sacrificed
 was
 borne
 away
 to
 the
 appointed
 gathering
 place
 of
 those
 by
 whom
 it
 was
 to
 be
 eaten
 During
 the
 first
 of
 the
 days
 of
 unleavened
 bread
 which
 in
 the
 year
 of
 our
 Lords
 death
 appears
 to
 have
 fallen
 on
 Thursday
 some
 of
 the
 Twelve
 inquired
 of
 Jesus
 where
 they
 should
 make
 preparations
 for
 the
 paschal
 meal
 He
 instructed
 Peter
 and
 John
 to
 return
 to
 Jerusalem
 and
 added
 Behold
 when
 ye
 are
 entered
 into
 the
 city
 there
 shall
 a
 man
 meet
 you
 bearing
 a
 pitcher
 of
 water
 follow
 him
 into
 the
 house
 where
 he
 entereth
 in
 And
 ye
 shall
 say
 unto
 the
 goodman
 of
 the
 house
 The
 Master
 saith
 unto
 thee
 Where
 is
 the
 guest
 chamber
 where
 I
 shall
 eat
 the
 passover
 with
 my
 disciples
 And
 he
 shall
 shew
 you
 a
 large
 upper
 room
 furnished
 there
 make
 ready
 And
 they
 went
 and
 found
 as
 he
 had
 said
 unto
 them
 and
 they
 made
 ready
 the
 passover
 In
 the
 evening
 Thursday
 evening
 as
 we
 reckon
 time
 but
 the
 beginning
 of
 Friday
 according
 to
 the
 Jewish
 calendar
 Jesus
 came
 with
 the
 Twelve
 and
 together
 they
 sat
 down
 to
 the
 last
 meal
 of
 which
 the
 Lord
 would
 partake
 before
 His
 death
 Under
 strain
 of
 profound
 emotion
 He
 said
 unto
 them
 With
 desire
 I
 have
 desired
 to
 eat
 this
 passover
 with
 you
 before
 I
 suffer
 for
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 I
 will
 not
 any
 more
 eat
 thereof
 until
 it
 be
 fulfilled
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 And
 he
 took
 the
 cup
 and
 gave
 thanks
 and
 said
 Take
 this
 and
 divide
 it
 among
 yourselves
 for
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 I
 will
 not
 drink
 of
 the
 fruit
 of
 the
 vine
 until
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 shall
 come
 The
 pronouncing
 of
 a
 blessing
 by
 the
 host
 upon
 a
 cup
 of
 wine
 which
 was
 afterward
 passed
 round
 the
 table
 to
 each
 participant
 in
 turn
 was
 the
 customary
 manner
 of
 beginning
 the
 Passover
 supper
 At
 this
 solemn
 meal
 Jesus
 appears
 to
 have
 observed
 the
 essentials
 of
 the
 Passover
 procedure
 but
 we
 have
 no
 record
 of
 His
 compliance
 with
 the
 many
 supernumerary
 requirements
 with
 which
 the
 divinely
 established
 memorial
 of
 Israels
 deliverance
 from
 bondage
 had
 been
 invested
 by
 traditional
 custom
 and
 rabbinical
 prescription
 As
 we
 shall
 see
 the
 evenings
 proceedings
 in
 that
 upper
 room
 comprized
 much
 beside
 the
 ordinary
 observance
 of
 an
 annual
 festival
 The
 supper
 proceeded
 under
 conditions
 of
 tense
 sadness
 As
 they
 ate
 the
 Lord
 sorrowfully
 remarked
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 One
 of
 you
 which
 eateth
 with
 me
 shall
 betray
 me
 Most
 of
 the
 apostles
 fell
 into
 a
 state
 of
 introspection
 and
 one
 after
 another
 exclaimed
 Is
 it
 I
 Lord
 is
 it
 I
 It
 is
 pleasing
 to
 note
 that
 each
 of
 those
 who
 so
 inquired
 was
 more
 concerned
 with
 the
 dread
 thought
 that
 possibly
 he
 was
 an
 offender
 however
 inadvertently
 so
 than
 as
 to
 whether
 his
 brother
 was
 about
 to
 prove
 himself
 a
 traitor
 Jesus
 answered
 that
 it
 was
 one
 of
 the
 Twelve
 then
 and
 there
 eating
 with
 Him
 from
 the
 common
 dish
 and
 continued
 with
 the
 terrifying
 pronouncement
 The
 Son
 of
 man
 indeed
 goeth
 as
 it
 is
 written
 of
 him
 but
 woe
 to
 that
 man
 by
 whom
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 is
 betrayed
 good
 were
 it
 for
 that
 man
 if
 he
 had
 never
 been
 born
 Then
 Judas
 Iscariot
 who
 had
 already
 covenanted
 to
 sell
 his
 Master
 for
 money
 and
 who
 at
 this
 moment
 probably
 feared
 that
 silence
 might
 arouse
 suspicion
 against
 himself
 asked
 with
 a
 brazen
 audacity
 that
 was
 veritably
 devilish
 Master
 is
 it
 I
 With
 cutting
 promptness
 the
 Lord
 replied
 Thou
 hast
 said
 There
 was
 further
 cause
 of
 sorrow
 to
 Jesus
 at
 the
 supper
 Some
 of
 the
 Twelve
 had
 fallen
 into
 muttering
 dispute
 among
 themselves
 over
 the
 matter
 of
 individual
 precedence
 possibly
 as
 to
 the
 order
 in
 which
 they
 should
 take
 their
 places
 at
 table
 over
 which
 triviality
 scribes
 and
 Pharisees
 as
 well
 as
 the
 Gentiles
 often
 quarreled
 and
 again
 the
 Lord
 had
 to
 remind
 the
 apostles
 that
 the
 greatest
 of
 them
 all
 was
 he
 who
 most
 willingly
 served
 his
 fellows
 They
 had
 been
 taught
 before
 yet
 now
 at
 this
 late
 and
 solemn
 hour
 they
 were
 suffused
 with
 vain
 and
 selfish
 ambition
 In
 sorrowful
 earnestness
 the
 Lord
 pleaded
 with
 them
 asking
 who
 is
 greater
 he
 that
 sits
 at
 the
 table
 or
 he
 that
 serves
 And
 the
 obvious
 reply
 He
 supplemented
 by
 the
 statement
 But
 I
 am
 among
 you
 as
 he
 that
 serveth
 With
 loving
 pathos
 He
 added
 Ye
 are
 they
 which
 have
 continued
 with
 me
 in
 my
 temptations
 and
 then
 He
 assured
 them
 that
 they
 should
 lack
 neither
 honor
 nor
 glory
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 for
 if
 they
 proved
 faithful
 they
 should
 be
 appointed
 to
 thrones
 as
 the
 judges
 of
 Israel
 For
 those
 of
 His
 chosen
 ones
 who
 were
 true
 to
 Him
 the
 Lord
 had
 no
 feeling
 less
 than
 that
 of
 love
 and
 of
 yearning
 for
 their
 victory
 over
 Satan
 and
 sin
 THE
 ORDINANCE
 OF
 THE
 WASHING
 OF
 FEET
 Leaving
 the
 table
 the
 Lord
 laid
 aside
 His
 outer
 garments
 and
 girded
 Himself
 with
 a
 towel
 as
 an
 apron
 then
 having
 provided
 Himself
 with
 a
 basin
 and
 a
 supply
 of
 water
 He
 knelt
 before
 each
 of
 the
 Twelve
 in
 turn
 washed
 his
 feet
 and
 wiped
 them
 with
 the
 towel
 When
 He
 reached
 Peter
 that
 impulsive
 apostle
 protested
 saying
 Lord
 dost
 thou
 wash
 my
 feet
 That
 the
 proceeding
 was
 something
 more
 than
 mere
 service
 for
 personal
 comfort
 and
 more
 than
 an
 objectlesson
 of
 humility
 appears
 in
 the
 Lords
 words
 to
 PeterWhat
 I
 do
 thou
 knowest
 not
 now
 but
 thou
 shalt
 know
 hereafter
 Peter
 failing
 to
 understand
 objected
 yet
 more
 vehemently
 Thou
 shalt
 never
 wash
 my
 feet
 he
 exclaimed
 Jesus
 answered
 If
 I
 wash
 thee
 not
 thou
 hast
 no
 part
 with
 me
 Then
 with
 even
 greater
 impetuosity
 than
 before
 Peter
 implored
 as
 he
 stretched
 forth
 both
 feet
 and
 hands
 Lord
 not
 my
 feet
 only
 but
 also
 my
 hands
 and
 my
 head
 He
 had
 gone
 to
 the
 other
 extreme
 insisting
 though
 ignorantly
 and
 unthinkingly
 that
 things
 be
 done
 his
 way
 and
 failing
 yet
 to
 see
 that
 the
 ordinance
 had
 to
 be
 administered
 as
 the
 Lord
 willed
 Again
 correcting
 His
 wellintending
 though
 presumptuous
 servant
 Jesus
 said
 to
 him
 He
 that
 is
 washed
 needeth
 not
 save
 to
 wash
 his
 feet
 but
 is
 clean
 every
 whit
 and
 ye
 are
 clean
 but
 not
 all
 Each
 of
 them
 had
 been
 immersed
 at
 baptism
 the
 washing
 of
 feet
 was
 an
 ordinance
 pertaining
 to
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 the
 full
 import
 of
 which
 they
 had
 yet
 to
 learn
 Having
 resumed
 His
 garments
 and
 returned
 to
 His
 place
 at
 the
 table
 Jesus
 impressed
 the
 significance
 of
 what
 he
 had
 done
 saying
 Ye
 call
 me
 Master
 and
 Lord
 and
 ye
 say
 well
 for
 so
 I
 am
 If
 I
 then
 your
 Lord
 and
 Master
 have
 washed
 your
 feet
 ye
 also
 ought
 to
 wash
 one
 anothers
 feet
 For
 I
 have
 given
 you
 an
 example
 that
 ye
 should
 do
 as
 I
 have
 done
 to
 you
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 The
 servant
 is
 not
 greater
 than
 his
 lord
 neither
 he
 that
 is
 sent
 greater
 than
 he
 that
 sent
 him
 If
 ye
 know
 these
 things
 happy
 are
 ye
 if
 ye
 do
 them
 THE
 SACRAMENT
 OF
 THE
 LORDS
 SUPPER
 While
 Jesus
 with
 the
 Twelve
 still
 sat
 at
 table
 He
 took
 a
 loaf
 or
 cake
 of
 bread
 and
 having
 reverently
 given
 thanks
 and
 by
 blessing
 sanctified
 it
 He
 gave
 a
 portion
 to
 each
 of
 the
 apostles
 saying
 Take
 eat
 this
 is
 my
 body
 or
 according
 to
 the
 more
 extended
 account
 This
 is
 my
 body
 which
 is
 given
 for
 you
 this
 do
 in
 remembrance
 of
 me
 Then
 taking
 a
 cup
 of
 wine
 He
 gave
 thanks
 and
 blessed
 it
 and
 gave
 it
 unto
 them
 with
 the
 command
 Drink
 ye
 all
 of
 it
 for
 this
 is
 my
 blood
 of
 the
 new
 testament
 which
 is
 shed
 for
 many
 for
 the
 remission
 of
 sins
 But
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 I
 will
 not
 drink
 henceforth
 of
 this
 fruit
 of
 the
 vine
 until
 that
 day
 when
 I
 drink
 it
 new
 with
 you
 in
 my
 Fathers
 kingdom
 In
 this
 simple
 but
 impressive
 manner
 was
 instituted
 the
 ordinance
 since
 known
 as
 the
 Sacrament
 of
 the
 Lords
 Supper
 The
 bread
 and
 wine
 duly
 consecrated
 by
 prayer
 become
 emblems
 of
 the
 Lords
 body
 and
 blood
 to
 be
 eaten
 and
 drunk
 reverently
 and
 in
 remembrance
 of
 Him
 The
 proceedings
 at
 the
 institution
 of
 this
 sacred
 rite
 were
 afterward
 revealed
 to
 Paul
 the
 apostle
 whose
 recorded
 testimony
 as
 to
 its
 establishment
 and
 sanctity
 is
 in
 accord
 with
 the
 accounts
 given
 by
 the
 Gospelwriters
 As
 shall
 be
 hereinafter
 shown
 the
 ordinance
 was
 instituted
 by
 the
 Lord
 among
 the
 Nephites
 on
 the
 western
 continent
 and
 has
 been
 reestablished
 in
 the
 present
 dispensation
 During
 the
 dark
 ages
 of
 apostasy
 unauthorized
 changes
 in
 the
 administration
 of
 the
 Sacrament
 were
 introduced
 and
 many
 false
 doctrines
 as
 to
 its
 meaning
 and
 effect
 were
 promulgated
 THE
 BETRAYER
 GOES
 OUT
 INTO
 THE
 NIGHT
 In
 saying
 to
 the
 Twelve
 whose
 feet
 He
 had
 washed
 Ye
 are
 clean
 the
 Lord
 had
 specified
 an
 exception
 by
 His
 after
 remark
 but
 not
 all
 John
 the
 recorder
 takes
 care
 to
 explain
 that
 Jesus
 had
 in
 mind
 the
 traitor
 and
 therefore
 said
 he
 Ye
 are
 not
 all
 clean
 The
 guilty
 Iscariot
 had
 received
 without
 protest
 the
 Lords
 service
 in
 the
 washing
 of
 his
 recreant
 feet
 though
 after
 the
 ablution
 he
 was
 spiritually
 more
 filthy
 than
 before
 When
 Jesus
 had
 again
 sat
 down
 the
 burden
 of
 His
 knowledge
 concerning
 the
 treacherous
 heart
 of
 Judas
 again
 found
 expression
 I
 speak
 not
 of
 you
 all
 He
 said
 I
 know
 whom
 I
 have
 chosen
 but
 that
 the
 scripture
 may
 be
 fulfilled
 He
 that
 eateth
 bread
 with
 me
 hath
 lifted
 up
 his
 heel
 against
 me
 The
 Lord
 was
 intent
 on
 impressing
 the
 fact
 of
 His
 foreknowledge
 as
 to
 what
 was
 to
 come
 so
 that
 when
 the
 terrible
 development
 was
 an
 accomplished
 fact
 the
 apostles
 would
 realize
 that
 thereby
 the
 scriptures
 had
 been
 fulfilled
 Troubled
 in
 spirit
 He
 reiterated
 the
 dreadful
 assertion
 that
 one
 of
 those
 present
 would
 betray
 Him
 Peter
 made
 signs
 to
 John
 who
 occupied
 the
 place
 next
 to
 Jesus
 and
 was
 at
 that
 moment
 leaning
 his
 head
 on
 the
 Lords
 breast
 that
 he
 ask
 which
 of
 them
 was
 the
 traitor
 To
 Johns
 whispered
 inquiry
 the
 Lord
 replied
 He
 it
 is
 to
 whom
 I
 shall
 give
 a
 sop
 when
 I
 have
 dipped
 it
 There
 was
 nothing
 unusual
 for
 a
 person
 at
 table
 particularly
 the
 host
 to
 dip
 a
 piece
 of
 bread
 into
 the
 dish
 of
 gravy
 or
 savory
 mixture
 and
 hand
 it
 to
 another
 Such
 action
 on
 the
 part
 of
 Jesus
 attracted
 no
 general
 attention
 He
 dipped
 the
 morsel
 of
 bread
 and
 gave
 it
 to
 Judas
 Iscariot
 with
 the
 words
 That
 thou
 doest
 do
 quickly
 The
 others
 understood
 the
 Lords
 remark
 as
 an
 instruction
 to
 Judas
 to
 attend
 to
 some
 duty
 or
 go
 upon
 some
 errand
 of
 ordinary
 kind
 perhaps
 to
 purchase
 something
 for
 the
 further
 celebration
 of
 the
 Passover
 or
 to
 carry
 gifts
 to
 some
 of
 the
 poor
 for
 Judas
 was
 the
 treasurer
 of
 the
 party
 and
 had
 the
 bag
 But
 Iscariot
 understood
 His
 heart
 was
 all
 the
 more
 hardened
 by
 the
 discovery
 that
 Jesus
 knew
 of
 his
 infamous
 plans
 and
 he
 was
 maddened
 by
 the
 humiliation
 he
 felt
 in
 the
 Masters
 presence
 After
 the
 sop
 which
 he
 had
 opened
 his
 mouth
 to
 receive
 from
 the
 Lords
 hand
 Satan
 entered
 into
 him
 and
 asserted
 malignant
 mastership
 Judas
 went
 out
 immediately
 abandoning
 forever
 the
 blessed
 company
 of
 his
 brethren
 and
 the
 Lord
 John
 chronicles
 the
 traitors
 departure
 with
 the
 terse
 and
 ominous
 remark
 and
 it
 was
 night
 DISCOURSE
 FOLLOWING
 THE
 SUPPER
 The
 departure
 of
 Judas
 Iscariot
 appears
 to
 have
 dissipated
 to
 some
 degree
 the
 cloud
 of
 utter
 sadness
 by
 which
 the
 little
 company
 had
 been
 depressed
 and
 our
 Lord
 Himself
 was
 visibly
 relieved
 As
 soon
 as
 the
 door
 had
 closed
 upon
 the
 retreating
 deserter
 Jesus
 exclaimed
 as
 though
 His
 victory
 over
 death
 had
 been
 already
 accomplished
 Now
 is
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 glorified
 and
 God
 is
 glorified
 in
 him
 Addressing
 the
 Eleven
 in
 terms
 of
 parental
 affection
 He
 said
 Little
 children
 yet
 a
 little
 while
 I
 am
 with
 you
 Ye
 shall
 seek
 me
 and
 as
 I
 said
 unto
 the
 Jews
 Whither
 I
 go
 ye
 cannot
 come
 so
 now
 I
 say
 to
 you
 A
 new
 commandment
 I
 give
 unto
 you
 That
 ye
 love
 one
 another
 as
 I
 have
 loved
 you
 that
 ye
 also
 love
 one
 another
 By
 this
 shall
 all
 men
 know
 that
 ye
 are
 my
 disciples
 if
 ye
 have
 love
 one
 to
 another
 The
 law
 of
 Moses
 enjoined
 mutual
 love
 among
 friends
 and
 neighbors
 but
 the
 new
 commandment
 by
 which
 the
 apostles
 were
 to
 be
 governed
 embodied
 love
 of
 a
 higher
 order
 They
 were
 to
 love
 one
 another
 as
 Christ
 loved
 them
 and
 their
 brotherly
 affection
 was
 to
 be
 a
 distinguishing
 mark
 of
 their
 apostleship
 by
 which
 the
 world
 would
 recognize
 them
 as
 men
 set
 apart
 The
 Lords
 reference
 to
 His
 impending
 separation
 from
 them
 troubled
 the
 brethren
 Peter
 put
 the
 question
 Lord
 whither
 goest
 thou
 Jesus
 answered
 Whither
 I
 go
 thou
 canst
 not
 follow
 me
 now
 but
 thou
 shalt
 follow
 me
 afterwards
 Peter
 said
 unto
 him
 Lord
 why
 cannot
 I
 follow
 thee
 now
 I
 will
 lay
 down
 my
 life
 for
 thy
 sake
 Peter
 seems
 to
 have
 realized
 that
 his
 Master
 was
 going
 to
 His
 death
 yet
 undeterred
 he
 asserted
 his
 readiness
 to
 follow
 even
 that
 dark
 way
 rather
 than
 be
 separated
 from
 his
 Lord
 We
 cannot
 doubt
 the
 earnestness
 of
 Peters
 purpose
 nor
 the
 sincerity
 of
 his
 desire
 at
 that
 moment
 In
 his
 bold
 avowal
 however
 he
 had
 reckoned
 with
 the
 willingness
 of
 his
 spirit
 only
 and
 had
 failed
 to
 take
 into
 full
 account
 the
 weakness
 of
 his
 flesh
 Jesus
 who
 knew
 Peter
 better
 than
 the
 man
 knew
 himself
 thus
 tenderly
 reproved
 his
 excess
 of
 selfconfidence
 Simon
 Simon
 behold
 Satan
 hath
 desired
 to
 have
 you
 that
 he
 may
 sift
 you
 as
 wheat
 but
 I
 have
 prayed
 for
 thee
 that
 thy
 faith
 fail
 not
 and
 when
 thou
 art
 converted
 strengthen
 thy
 brethren
 The
 first
 of
 the
 apostles
 the
 Man
 of
 Rock
 yet
 had
 to
 be
 converted
 or
 as
 more
 precisely
 rendered
 turned
 again
 for
 as
 the
 Lord
 foresaw
 Peter
 would
 soon
 be
 overcome
 even
 to
 the
 extent
 of
 denying
 his
 acquaintanceship
 with
 Christ
 When
 Peter
 stoutly
 declared
 again
 his
 readiness
 to
 go
 with
 Jesus
 even
 into
 prison
 or
 to
 death
 the
 Lord
 silenced
 him
 with
 the
 remark
 I
 tell
 thee
 Peter
 the
 cock
 shall
 not
 crow
 this
 day
 before
 that
 thou
 shalt
 thrice
 deny
 that
 thou
 knowest
 me
 The
 apostles
 had
 to
 be
 prepared
 to
 meet
 a
 new
 order
 of
 things
 new
 conditions
 and
 new
 exigencies
 persecution
 awaited
 them
 and
 they
 were
 soon
 to
 be
 bereft
 of
 the
 Masters
 sustaining
 presence
 Jesus
 asked
 of
 them
 When
 I
 sent
 you
 without
 purse
 and
 scrip
 and
 shoes
 lacked
 ye
 anything
 And
 they
 said
 Nothing
 Then
 said
 he
 unto
 them
 But
 now
 he
 that
 hath
 a
 purse
 let
 him
 take
 it
 and
 likewise
 his
 scrip
 and
 he
 that
 hath
 no
 sword
 let
 him
 sell
 his
 garment
 and
 buy
 one
 For
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 that
 this
 that
 is
 written
 must
 yet
 be
 accomplished
 in
 me
 And
 he
 was
 reckoned
 among
 the
 transgressors
 for
 the
 things
 concerning
 me
 have
 an
 end
 The
 Lord
 was
 soon
 to
 be
 numbered
 among
 the
 transgressors
 as
 had
 been
 foreseen
 and
 His
 disciples
 would
 be
 regarded
 as
 the
 devotees
 of
 an
 executed
 criminal
 In
 the
 mention
 of
 purse
 scrip
 shoes
 and
 sword
 some
 of
 the
 brethren
 caught
 at
 the
 literal
 meaning
 and
 said
 Lord
 behold
 here
 are
 two
 swords
 Jesus
 answered
 with
 curt
 finality
 It
 is
 enough
 or
 as
 we
 might
 say
 Enough
 of
 this
 He
 had
 not
 intimated
 any
 immediate
 need
 of
 weapons
 and
 most
 assuredly
 not
 for
 His
 own
 defense
 Again
 they
 had
 failed
 to
 fathom
 His
 meaning
 but
 experience
 would
 later
 teach
 them
 For
 such
 information
 as
 we
 have
 concerning
 the
 last
 discourse
 delivered
 by
 Jesus
 to
 the
 apostles
 before
 His
 crucifixion
 we
 are
 indebted
 to
 John
 alone
 among
 the
 Gospelwriters
 and
 every
 reader
 is
 advized
 to
 study
 with
 care
 the
 three
 chapters
 in
 which
 these
 sublime
 utterances
 are
 preserved
 for
 the
 enlightenment
 of
 mankind
 Observing
 the
 sorrowful
 state
 of
 the
 Eleven
 the
 Master
 bade
 them
 be
 of
 good
 cheer
 grounding
 their
 encouragement
 and
 hope
 on
 faith
 in
 Himself
 Let
 not
 your
 heart
 be
 troubled
 He
 said
 ye
 believe
 in
 God
 believe
 also
 in
 me
 Then
 as
 though
 drawing
 aside
 the
 veil
 between
 the
 earthly
 and
 the
 heavenly
 state
 and
 giving
 His
 faithful
 servants
 a
 glimpse
 of
 conditions
 beyond
 He
 continued
 In
 my
 Fathers
 house
 are
 many
 mansions
 if
 it
 were
 not
 so
 I
 would
 have
 told
 you
 I
 go
 to
 prepare
 a
 place
 for
 you
 And
 if
 I
 go
 and
 prepare
 a
 place
 for
 you
 I
 will
 come
 again
 and
 receive
 you
 unto
 myself
 that
 where
 I
 am
 there
 ye
 may
 be
 also
 And
 whither
 I
 go
 ye
 know
 and
 the
 way
 ye
 know
 Thus
 in
 language
 simple
 and
 plain
 the
 Lord
 declared
 the
 fact
 of
 graded
 conditions
 in
 the
 hereafter
 of
 variety
 of
 occupation
 and
 degrees
 of
 glory
 of
 place
 and
 station
 in
 the
 eternal
 worlds
 He
 had
 affirmed
 His
 own
 inherent
 Godship
 and
 through
 their
 trust
 in
 Him
 and
 obedience
 to
 His
 requirements
 would
 they
 find
 the
 way
 to
 follow
 whither
 He
 was
 about
 to
 precede
 them
 Thomas
 that
 loving
 brave
 though
 somewhat
 skeptical
 soul
 desiring
 more
 definite
 information
 ventured
 to
 say
 Lord
 we
 know
 not
 whither
 thou
 goest
 and
 how
 can
 we
 know
 the
 way
 The
 Lords
 answer
 was
 a
 reaffirmation
 of
 His
 divinity
 I
 am
 the
 way
 the
 truth
 and
 the
 life
 no
 man
 cometh
 unto
 the
 Father
 but
 by
 me
 If
 ye
 had
 known
 me
 ye
 should
 have
 known
 my
 Father
 also
 and
 from
 henceforth
 ye
 know
 him
 and
 have
 seen
 him
 At
 this
 point
 Philip
 interposed
 with
 the
 request
 Lord
 shew
 us
 the
 Father
 and
 it
 sufficeth
 us
 Jesus
 answered
 with
 pathetic
 and
 mild
 reproof
 Have
 I
 been
 so
 long
 time
 with
 you
 and
 yet
 hast
 thou
 not
 known
 me
 Philip
 he
 that
 hath
 seen
 me
 hath
 seen
 the
 Father
 and
 how
 sayest
 thou
 then
 Shew
 us
 the
 Father
 He
 was
 grieved
 by
 the
 thought
 that
 His
 nearest
 and
 dearest
 friends
 on
 earth
 those
 upon
 whom
 He
 had
 conferred
 the
 authority
 of
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 should
 be
 yet
 ignorant
 of
 His
 absolute
 oneness
 with
 the
 Father
 in
 purpose
 and
 action
 Had
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 stood
 amongst
 them
 in
 Person
 under
 the
 conditions
 there
 existing
 He
 would
 have
 done
 as
 did
 the
 Well
 Beloved
 and
 Only
 Begotten
 Son
 whom
 they
 knew
 as
 Jesus
 their
 Lord
 and
 Master
 So
 absolutely
 were
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Son
 of
 one
 heart
 and
 mind
 that
 to
 know
 either
 was
 to
 know
 both
 nevertheless
 the
 Father
 could
 be
 reached
 only
 through
 the
 Son
 So
 far
 as
 the
 apostles
 had
 faith
 in
 Christ
 and
 did
 His
 will
 should
 they
 be
 able
 to
 do
 the
 works
 that
 Christ
 in
 the
 flesh
 had
 done
 and
 even
 greater
 things
 for
 His
 mortal
 mission
 was
 of
 but
 a
 few
 hours
 further
 duration
 and
 the
 unfolding
 of
 the
 divine
 plan
 of
 the
 ages
 would
 call
 for
 yet
 greater
 miracles
 than
 those
 wrought
 by
 Jesus
 in
 the
 brief
 period
 of
 His
 ministry
 For
 the
 first
 time
 the
 Lord
 directed
 His
 disciples
 to
 pray
 in
 His
 name
 to
 the
 Father
 and
 assurance
 of
 success
 in
 righteous
 supplication
 was
 given
 in
 these
 words
 And
 whatsoever
 ye
 shall
 ask
 in
 my
 name
 that
 will
 I
 do
 that
 the
 Father
 may
 be
 glorified
 in
 the
 Son
 If
 ye
 shall
 ask
 any
 thing
 in
 my
 name
 I
 will
 do
 it
 The
 name
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 to
 be
 thenceforth
 the
 divinely
 established
 talisman
 by
 which
 the
 powers
 of
 heaven
 could
 be
 invoked
 to
 operate
 in
 any
 righteous
 undertaking
 The
 Holy
 Ghost
 was
 promised
 to
 the
 apostles
 He
 would
 be
 sent
 through
 Christs
 intercession
 to
 be
 to
 them
 another
 Comforter
 or
 as
 rendered
 in
 later
 translations
 another
 Advocate
 or
 Helper
 even
 the
 Spirit
 of
 Truth
 who
 though
 the
 world
 would
 reject
 Him
 as
 they
 had
 rejected
 the
 Christ
 should
 dwell
 with
 the
 disciples
 and
 in
 them
 even
 as
 Christ
 then
 dwelt
 in
 them
 and
 the
 Father
 in
 Him
 I
 will
 not
 leave
 you
 comfortless
 Jesus
 assured
 the
 brethren
 I
 will
 come
 to
 you
 Yet
 a
 little
 while
 and
 the
 world
 seeth
 me
 no
 more
 but
 ye
 see
 me
 because
 I
 live
 ye
 shall
 live
 also
 At
 that
 day
 ye
 shall
 know
 that
 I
 am
 in
 my
 Father
 and
 ye
 in
 me
 and
 I
 in
 you
 This
 was
 followed
 by
 the
 assurance
 that
 Christ
 though
 unknown
 by
 the
 world
 would
 manifest
 Himself
 to
 those
 who
 loved
 Him
 and
 kept
 His
 commandments
 Judas
 Thaddeus
 otherwise
 known
 as
 Lebbeus
 not
 Iscariot
 as
 the
 recorder
 is
 careful
 to
 particularize
 was
 puzzled
 over
 the
 untraditional
 and
 unJewish
 thought
 of
 a
 Messiah
 who
 would
 be
 known
 but
 to
 the
 chosen
 few
 and
 not
 to
 Israel
 at
 large
 and
 he
 asked
 Lord
 how
 is
 it
 that
 thou
 wilt
 manifest
 thyself
 unto
 us
 and
 not
 unto
 the
 world
 Jesus
 explained
 that
 His
 and
 the
 Fathers
 companionship
 was
 attainable
 only
 by
 the
 faithful
 He
 further
 cheered
 the
 apostles
 by
 the
 promise
 that
 when
 the
 Comforter
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 whom
 the
 Father
 would
 send
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Son
 would
 come
 to
 them
 He
 would
 teach
 them
 further
 and
 would
 bring
 to
 their
 remembrance
 the
 teachings
 they
 had
 received
 from
 the
 Christ
 The
 distinct
 personality
 of
 each
 member
 of
 the
 Godhead
 Father
 Son
 and
 Holy
 Ghost
 is
 here
 again
 plainly
 shown
 Comforting
 the
 yet
 troubled
 disciples
 Jesus
 said
 Peace
 I
 leave
 with
 you
 my
 peace
 I
 give
 unto
 you
 and
 that
 they
 might
 realize
 that
 this
 meant
 more
 than
 the
 conventional
 salutation
 of
 the
 times
 for
 Peace
 be
 with
 you
 was
 an
 everyday
 greeting
 among
 the
 Jews
 the
 Lord
 affirmed
 that
 He
 gave
 that
 invocation
 in
 a
 higher
 sense
 and
 not
 as
 the
 world
 giveth
 Again
 bidding
 them
 put
 aside
 their
 grief
 and
 be
 not
 afraid
 Jesus
 added
 Ye
 have
 heard
 how
 I
 said
 unto
 you
 I
 go
 away
 and
 come
 again
 unto
 you
 If
 ye
 loved
 me
 ye
 would
 rejoice
 because
 I
 said
 I
 go
 unto
 the
 Father
 for
 my
 Father
 is
 greater
 than
 I
 The
 Lord
 made
 clear
 to
 His
 servants
 that
 He
 had
 told
 them
 these
 things
 beforehand
 so
 that
 when
 the
 predicted
 events
 came
 to
 pass
 the
 apostles
 would
 be
 confirmed
 in
 their
 faith
 in
 Him
 the
 Christ
 He
 had
 time
 to
 say
 but
 little
 more
 for
 the
 next
 hour
 would
 witness
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 supreme
 struggle
 the
 prince
 of
 this
 world
 cometh
 He
 said
 and
 with
 triumphal
 joy
 added
 and
 hath
 nothing
 in
 me
 In
 superb
 allegory
 the
 Lord
 thus
 proceeded
 to
 illustrate
 the
 vital
 relationship
 between
 the
 apostles
 and
 Himself
 and
 between
 Himself
 and
 the
 Father
 by
 the
 figure
 of
 a
 vinegrower
 a
 vine
 and
 its
 branches
 I
 am
 the
 true
 vine
 and
 my
 Father
 is
 the
 husbandman
 Every
 branch
 in
 me
 that
 beareth
 not
 fruit
 he
 taketh
 away
 and
 every
 branch
 that
 beareth
 fruit
 he
 purgeth
 it
 that
 it
 may
 bring
 forth
 more
 fruit
 A
 grander
 analogy
 is
 not
 to
 be
 found
 in
 the
 worlds
 literature
 Those
 ordained
 servants
 of
 the
 Lord
 were
 as
 helpless
 and
 useless
 without
 Him
 as
 is
 a
 bough
 severed
 from
 the
 tree
 As
 the
 branch
 is
 made
 fruitful
 only
 by
 virtue
 of
 the
 nourishing
 sap
 it
 receives
 from
 the
 rooted
 trunk
 and
 if
 cut
 away
 or
 broken
 off
 withers
 dries
 and
 becomes
 utterly
 worthless
 except
 as
 fuel
 for
 the
 burning
 so
 those
 men
 though
 ordained
 to
 the
 Holy
 Apostleship
 would
 find
 themselves
 strong
 and
 fruitful
 in
 good
 works
 only
 as
 they
 remained
 in
 steadfast
 communion
 with
 the
 Lord
 Without
 Christ
 what
 were
 they
 but
 unschooled
 Galileans
 some
 of
 them
 fishermen
 one
 a
 publican
 the
 rest
 of
 undistinguished
 attainments
 and
 all
 of
 them
 weak
 mortals
 As
 branches
 of
 the
 Vine
 they
 were
 at
 that
 hour
 clean
 and
 healthful
 through
 the
 instructions
 and
 authoritative
 ordinances
 with
 which
 they
 had
 been
 blessed
 and
 by
 the
 reverent
 obedience
 they
 had
 manifested
 Abide
 in
 me
 was
 the
 Lords
 forceful
 admonition
 else
 they
 would
 become
 but
 withered
 boughs
 I
 am
 the
 vine
 He
 added
 in
 explication
 of
 the
 allegory
 ye
 are
 the
 branches
 He
 that
 abideth
 in
 me
 and
 I
 in
 him
 the
 same
 bringeth
 forth
 much
 fruit
 for
 without
 me
 ye
 can
 do
 nothing
 If
 a
 man
 abide
 not
 in
 me
 he
 is
 cast
 forth
 as
 a
 branch
 and
 is
 withered
 and
 men
 gather
 them
 and
 cast
 them
 into
 the
 fire
 and
 they
 are
 burned
 If
 ye
 abide
 in
 me
 and
 my
 words
 abide
 in
 you
 ye
 shall
 ask
 what
 ye
 will
 and
 it
 shall
 be
 done
 unto
 you
 Herein
 is
 my
 Father
 glorified
 that
 ye
 bear
 much
 fruit
 so
 shall
 ye
 be
 my
 disciples
 Their
 love
 for
 one
 another
 was
 again
 specified
 as
 an
 essential
 to
 their
 continued
 love
 for
 Christ
 In
 that
 love
 would
 they
 find
 joy
 Christ
 had
 been
 to
 them
 an
 exemplar
 of
 righteous
 love
 from
 the
 day
 of
 their
 first
 meeting
 and
 He
 was
 about
 to
 give
 the
 supreme
 proof
 of
 His
 affection
 as
 foreshadowed
 in
 His
 words
 Greater
 love
 hath
 no
 man
 than
 this
 that
 a
 man
 lay
 down
 his
 life
 for
 his
 friends
 And
 that
 those
 men
 were
 the
 Lords
 friends
 was
 thus
 graciously
 affirmed
 Ye
 are
 my
 friends
 if
 ye
 do
 whatsoever
 I
 command
 you
 Henceforth
 I
 call
 you
 not
 servants
 for
 the
 servant
 knoweth
 not
 what
 his
 lord
 doeth
 but
 I
 have
 called
 you
 friends
 for
 all
 things
 that
 I
 have
 heard
 of
 my
 Father
 I
 have
 made
 known
 unto
 you
 This
 intimate
 relationship
 in
 no
 sense
 modified
 the
 position
 of
 Christ
 as
 their
 Lord
 and
 Master
 for
 by
 Him
 they
 had
 been
 chosen
 and
 ordained
 and
 it
 was
 His
 will
 that
 they
 should
 so
 live
 that
 whatever
 they
 asked
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 holy
 friendship
 which
 He
 acknowledged
 should
 be
 granted
 them
 of
 the
 Father
 They
 were
 again
 told
 of
 the
 persecutions
 that
 awaited
 them
 and
 of
 their
 apostolic
 calling
 as
 special
 and
 individual
 witnesses
 of
 the
 Lord
 That
 the
 world
 then
 did
 and
 would
 yet
 more
 intensely
 hate
 them
 was
 a
 fact
 they
 had
 to
 face
 but
 they
 were
 to
 remember
 that
 the
 world
 had
 hated
 their
 Master
 before
 them
 and
 that
 they
 had
 been
 chosen
 and
 by
 ordination
 had
 been
 set
 apart
 from
 the
 world
 therefore
 they
 must
 not
 hope
 to
 escape
 the
 worlds
 hatred
 The
 servant
 was
 not
 greater
 than
 his
 master
 nor
 the
 apostle
 than
 his
 Lord
 as
 on
 general
 principles
 they
 knew
 and
 as
 they
 had
 been
 specifically
 told
 They
 that
 hated
 them
 hated
 the
 Christ
 and
 they
 that
 hated
 the
 Son
 hated
 the
 Father
 great
 shall
 be
 the
 condemnation
 of
 such
 Had
 the
 wicked
 Jews
 not
 closed
 their
 eyes
 and
 stopped
 their
 ears
 to
 the
 mighty
 works
 and
 gracious
 words
 of
 the
 Messiah
 they
 would
 have
 been
 convinced
 of
 the
 truth
 and
 the
 truth
 would
 have
 saved
 them
 but
 they
 were
 left
 without
 cloak
 or
 excuse
 for
 their
 sin
 and
 Christ
 affirmed
 that
 in
 their
 evil
 course
 had
 the
 scriptures
 been
 fulfilled
 in
 that
 they
 had
 hated
 Him
 without
 a
 cause
 Then
 reverting
 to
 the
 great
 and
 cheering
 promise
 of
 support
 through
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 the
 Lord
 said
 But
 when
 the
 Comforter
 is
 come
 whom
 I
 will
 send
 unto
 you
 from
 the
 Father
 even
 the
 Spirit
 of
 truth
 which
 proceedeth
 from
 the
 Father
 he
 shall
 testify
 of
 me
 and
 ye
 also
 shall
 bear
 witness
 because
 ye
 have
 been
 with
 me
 from
 the
 beginning
 These
 things
 had
 Jesus
 declared
 unto
 them
 that
 they
 might
 not
 be
 offended
 or
 in
 other
 words
 taken
 by
 surprize
 misled
 and
 caused
 to
 doubt
 and
 stumble
 by
 the
 unprecedented
 events
 then
 impending
 The
 apostles
 were
 forewarned
 of
 persecution
 of
 their
 expulsion
 from
 the
 synagogs
 and
 of
 a
 time
 in
 which
 hatred
 against
 them
 should
 be
 so
 bitter
 and
 the
 Satanic
 darkness
 of
 mind
 and
 spirit
 so
 dense
 that
 whosoever
 succeeded
 in
 killing
 one
 of
 them
 would
 profess
 that
 his
 foul
 deed
 had
 been
 done
 in
 Gods
 service
 In
 view
 of
 their
 overwhelming
 sorrow
 at
 the
 Lords
 departure
 He
 sought
 again
 to
 cheer
 them
 saying
 Nevertheless
 I
 tell
 you
 the
 truth
 It
 is
 expedient
 for
 you
 that
 I
 go
 away
 for
 if
 I
 go
 not
 away
 the
 Comforter
 will
 not
 come
 unto
 you
 but
 if
 I
 depart
 I
 will
 send
 him
 unto
 you
 The
 assured
 descent
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 through
 whom
 they
 should
 be
 made
 strong
 to
 meet
 every
 need
 and
 emergency
 was
 the
 inspiring
 theme
 of
 this
 part
 of
 the
 Lords
 discourse
 Many
 things
 which
 Christ
 yet
 had
 to
 say
 to
 His
 apostles
 but
 which
 they
 were
 at
 that
 time
 unable
 to
 understand
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 would
 teach
 them
 Howbeit
 said
 Jesus
 when
 he
 the
 Spirit
 of
 truth
 is
 come
 he
 will
 guide
 you
 into
 all
 truth
 for
 he
 shall
 not
 speak
 of
 himself
 but
 whatsoever
 he
 shall
 hear
 that
 shall
 he
 speak
 and
 he
 will
 shew
 you
 things
 to
 come
 He
 shall
 glorify
 me
 for
 he
 shall
 receive
 of
 mine
 and
 shall
 shew
 it
 unto
 you
 All
 things
 that
 the
 Father
 hath
 are
 mine
 therefore
 said
 I
 that
 he
 shall
 take
 of
 mine
 and
 shall
 shew
 it
 unto
 you
 Turning
 again
 to
 the
 matter
 of
 His
 departure
 then
 so
 near
 as
 to
 be
 reckoned
 by
 hours
 the
 Lord
 said
 in
 amplified
 form
 of
 what
 He
 had
 before
 affirmed
 A
 little
 while
 and
 ye
 shall
 not
 see
 me
 and
 again
 a
 little
 while
 and
 ye
 shall
 see
 me
 because
 I
 go
 to
 the
 Father
 The
 apostles
 pondered
 and
 some
 questioned
 among
 themselves
 as
 to
 the
 Lords
 meaning
 yet
 so
 deep
 was
 the
 solemnity
 of
 the
 occasion
 that
 they
 ventured
 no
 open
 inquiry
 Jesus
 knew
 of
 their
 perplexity
 and
 graciously
 explained
 that
 they
 would
 soon
 weep
 and
 lament
 while
 the
 world
 rejoiced
 this
 had
 reference
 to
 His
 death
 but
 He
 promised
 that
 their
 sorrow
 should
 be
 turned
 into
 joy
 and
 this
 was
 based
 on
 His
 resurrection
 to
 which
 they
 should
 be
 witnesses
 He
 compared
 their
 then
 present
 and
 prospective
 state
 to
 that
 of
 a
 woman
 in
 travail
 who
 in
 the
 after
 joy
 of
 blessed
 motherhood
 forgets
 her
 anguish
 The
 happiness
 that
 awaited
 them
 would
 be
 beyond
 the
 power
 of
 man
 to
 take
 away
 and
 thenceforth
 they
 should
 ask
 not
 of
 Christ
 alone
 but
 of
 the
 Father
 in
 Christs
 name
 And
 said
 the
 Lord
 in
 that
 day
 ye
 shall
 ask
 me
 nothing
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Whatsoever
 ye
 shall
 ask
 the
 Father
 in
 my
 name
 he
 will
 give
 it
 you
 Hitherto
 have
 ye
 asked
 nothing
 in
 my
 name
 ask
 and
 ye
 shall
 receive
 that
 your
 joy
 may
 be
 full
 They
 were
 to
 be
 advanced
 to
 such
 honor
 and
 exalted
 recognition
 that
 they
 should
 approach
 the
 Father
 in
 prayer
 direct
 but
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Son
 for
 they
 were
 beloved
 of
 the
 Father
 because
 they
 had
 loved
 Jesus
 the
 Son
 and
 had
 accepted
 Him
 as
 One
 sent
 by
 the
 Father
 The
 Lord
 again
 solemnly
 averred
 I
 came
 forth
 from
 the
 Father
 and
 am
 come
 into
 the
 world
 again
 I
 leave
 the
 world
 and
 go
 to
 the
 Father
 The
 disciples
 were
 gratified
 at
 this
 plain
 avouchment
 and
 exclaimed
 Lo
 now
 speakest
 thou
 plainly
 and
 speakest
 no
 proverb
 Now
 are
 we
 sure
 that
 thou
 knowest
 all
 things
 and
 needest
 not
 that
 any
 man
 should
 ask
 thee
 by
 this
 we
 believe
 that
 thou
 camest
 forth
 from
 God
 Their
 satisfaction
 threatened
 danger
 through
 overconfidence
 and
 the
 Lord
 cautioned
 them
 saying
 that
 in
 an
 hour
 then
 close
 they
 should
 all
 be
 scattered
 every
 man
 to
 his
 own
 leaving
 Jesus
 alone
 except
 for
 the
 Fathers
 presence
 In
 the
 same
 connection
 He
 told
 them
 that
 before
 the
 night
 had
 passed
 every
 one
 of
 them
 would
 be
 offended
 because
 of
 Him
 even
 as
 it
 had
 been
 written
 I
 will
 smite
 the
 shepherd
 and
 the
 sheep
 of
 the
 flock
 shall
 be
 scattered
 abroad
 Peter
 the
 most
 vehement
 of
 all
 in
 his
 protestations
 had
 been
 told
 as
 we
 have
 seen
 that
 by
 cockcrow
 that
 night
 he
 would
 have
 thrice
 denied
 his
 Lord
 but
 all
 of
 them
 had
 declared
 they
 would
 be
 faithful
 whatever
 the
 trial
 In
 further
 affirmation
 of
 the
 material
 actuality
 of
 His
 resurrection
 Jesus
 promised
 the
 apostles
 that
 after
 He
 had
 risen
 from
 the
 grave
 He
 would
 go
 before
 them
 into
 Galilee
 In
 conclusion
 of
 this
 last
 and
 most
 solemn
 of
 the
 discourses
 delivered
 by
 Christ
 in
 the
 flesh
 the
 Lord
 said
 These
 things
 I
 have
 spoken
 unto
 you
 that
 in
 me
 ye
 might
 have
 peace
 In
 the
 world
 ye
 shall
 have
 tribulation
 but
 be
 of
 good
 cheer
 I
 have
 overcome
 the
 world
 THE
 CONCLUDING
 PRAYER
 The
 impressive
 discourse
 to
 the
 apostles
 was
 followed
 by
 a
 prayer
 such
 as
 could
 be
 addressed
 to
 none
 but
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 and
 such
 as
 none
 but
 the
 Son
 of
 that
 Father
 could
 offer
 It
 has
 been
 called
 and
 not
 inappropriately
 the
 Lords
 HighPriestly
 Prayer
 In
 it
 Jesus
 acknowledged
 the
 Father
 as
 the
 source
 of
 His
 power
 and
 authority
 which
 authority
 extends
 even
 to
 the
 giving
 of
 eternal
 life
 to
 all
 who
 are
 worthy
 And
 this
 is
 life
 eternal
 that
 they
 might
 know
 thee
 the
 only
 true
 God
 and
 Jesus
 Christ
 whom
 thou
 hast
 sent
 By
 way
 of
 reverent
 report
 as
 to
 the
 work
 assigned
 Him
 the
 Son
 said
 I
 have
 glorified
 thee
 on
 the
 earth
 I
 have
 finished
 the
 work
 which
 thou
 gavest
 me
 to
 do
 And
 now
 O
 Father
 glorify
 thou
 me
 with
 thine
 own
 self
 with
 the
 glory
 which
 I
 had
 with
 thee
 before
 the
 world
 was
 With
 unfathomable
 love
 the
 Lord
 pleaded
 for
 those
 whom
 the
 Father
 had
 given
 Him
 the
 apostles
 then
 present
 who
 had
 been
 called
 out
 from
 the
 world
 and
 who
 had
 been
 true
 to
 their
 testimony
 of
 Himself
 as
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 Of
 them
 but
 one
 the
 son
 of
 perdition
 had
 been
 lost
 In
 the
 fervor
 of
 devoted
 supplication
 the
 Lord
 pleaded
 I
 pray
 not
 that
 thou
 shouldest
 take
 them
 out
 of
 the
 world
 but
 that
 thou
 shouldest
 keep
 them
 from
 the
 evil
 They
 are
 not
 of
 the
 world
 even
 as
 I
 am
 not
 of
 the
 world
 Sanctify
 them
 through
 thy
 truth
 thy
 word
 is
 truth
 As
 thou
 hast
 sent
 me
 into
 the
 world
 even
 so
 have
 I
 also
 sent
 them
 into
 the
 world
 And
 for
 their
 sakes
 I
 sanctify
 myself
 that
 they
 also
 might
 be
 sanctified
 through
 the
 truth
 Neither
 pray
 I
 for
 these
 alone
 but
 for
 them
 also
 which
 shall
 believe
 on
 me
 through
 their
 word
 that
 they
 all
 may
 be
 one
 as
 thou
 Father
 art
 in
 me
 and
 I
 in
 thee
 that
 they
 also
 may
 be
 one
 in
 us
 that
 the
 world
 may
 believe
 that
 thou
 hast
 sent
 me
 And
 the
 glory
 which
 thou
 gavest
 me
 I
 have
 given
 them
 that
 they
 may
 be
 one
 even
 as
 we
 are
 one
 I
 in
 them
 and
 thou
 in
 me
 that
 they
 may
 be
 made
 perfect
 in
 one
 and
 that
 the
 world
 may
 know
 that
 thou
 hast
 sent
 me
 and
 hast
 loved
 them
 as
 thou
 hast
 loved
 me
 Father
 I
 will
 that
 they
 also
 whom
 thou
 hast
 given
 me
 be
 with
 me
 where
 I
 am
 that
 they
 may
 behold
 my
 glory
 which
 thou
 hast
 given
 me
 for
 thou
 lovedst
 me
 before
 the
 foundation
 of
 the
 world
 O
 righteous
 Father
 the
 world
 hath
 not
 known
 thee
 but
 I
 have
 known
 thee
 and
 these
 have
 known
 that
 thou
 hast
 sent
 me
 And
 I
 have
 declared
 unto
 them
 thy
 name
 and
 will
 declare
 it
 that
 the
 love
 wherewith
 thou
 hast
 loved
 me
 may
 be
 in
 them
 and
 I
 in
 them
 When
 they
 had
 sung
 a
 hymn
 Jesus
 and
 the
 Eleven
 went
 out
 to
 the
 Mount
 of
 Olives
 THE
 LORDS
 AGONY
 IN
 GETHSEMANE
 Jesus
 and
 the
 eleven
 apostles
 went
 forth
 from
 the
 house
 in
 which
 they
 had
 eaten
 passed
 through
 the
 city
 gate
 which
 was
 usually
 left
 open
 at
 night
 during
 a
 public
 festival
 crossed
 the
 ravine
 of
 the
 Cedron
 or
 more
 accurately
 Kidron
 brook
 and
 entered
 an
 olive
 orchard
 known
 as
 Gethsemane
 on
 the
 slope
 of
 Mount
 Olivet
 Eight
 of
 the
 apostles
 He
 left
 at
 or
 near
 the
 entrance
 with
 the
 instruction
 Sit
 ye
 here
 while
 I
 go
 and
 pray
 yonder
 and
 with
 the
 earnest
 injunction
 Pray
 that
 ye
 enter
 not
 into
 temptation
 Accompanied
 by
 Peter
 James
 and
 John
 He
 went
 farther
 and
 was
 soon
 enveloped
 by
 deep
 sorrow
 which
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 in
 a
 measure
 surprizing
 to
 Himself
 for
 we
 read
 that
 He
 began
 to
 be
 sore
 amazed
 and
 to
 be
 very
 heavy
 He
 was
 impelled
 to
 deny
 Himself
 the
 companionship
 of
 even
 the
 chosen
 three
 and
 Saith
 he
 unto
 them
 My
 soul
 is
 exceeding
 sorrowful
 even
 unto
 death
 tarry
 ye
 here
 and
 watch
 with
 me
 And
 he
 went
 a
 little
 farther
 and
 fell
 on
 his
 face
 and
 prayed
 saying
 O
 my
 Father
 if
 it
 be
 possible
 let
 this
 cup
 pass
 from
 me
 nevertheless
 not
 as
 I
 will
 but
 as
 thou
 wilt
 Marks
 version
 of
 the
 prayer
 is
 Abba
 Father
 all
 things
 are
 possible
 unto
 thee
 take
 away
 this
 cup
 from
 me
 nevertheless
 not
 what
 I
 will
 but
 what
 thou
 wilt
 This
 part
 of
 His
 impassioned
 supplication
 was
 heard
 by
 at
 least
 one
 of
 the
 waiting
 three
 but
 all
 of
 them
 soon
 yielded
 to
 weariness
 and
 ceased
 to
 watch
 As
 on
 the
 Mount
 of
 Transfiguration
 when
 the
 Lord
 appeared
 in
 glory
 so
 now
 in
 the
 hour
 of
 His
 deepest
 humiliation
 these
 three
 slumbered
 Returning
 to
 them
 in
 an
 agony
 of
 soul
 Jesus
 found
 them
 sleeping
 and
 addressing
 Peter
 who
 so
 short
 a
 time
 before
 had
 loudly
 proclaimed
 his
 readiness
 to
 follow
 the
 Lord
 even
 to
 prison
 and
 death
 Jesus
 exclaimed
 What
 could
 ye
 not
 watch
 with
 me
 one
 hour
 Watch
 and
 pray
 that
 ye
 enter
 not
 into
 temptation
 but
 in
 tenderness
 added
 the
 spirit
 indeed
 is
 willing
 but
 the
 flesh
 is
 weak
 The
 admonition
 to
 the
 apostles
 to
 pray
 at
 that
 time
 lest
 they
 be
 led
 into
 temptation
 may
 have
 been
 prompted
 by
 the
 exigencies
 of
 the
 hour
 under
 which
 if
 left
 to
 themselves
 they
 would
 be
 tempted
 to
 prematurely
 desert
 their
 Lord
 Aroused
 from
 slumber
 the
 three
 apostles
 saw
 the
 Lord
 again
 retire
 and
 heard
 Him
 pleading
 in
 agony
 O
 my
 Father
 if
 this
 cup
 may
 not
 pass
 away
 from
 me
 except
 I
 drink
 it
 thy
 will
 be
 done
 Returning
 a
 second
 time
 He
 found
 those
 whom
 He
 had
 so
 sorrowfully
 requested
 to
 watch
 with
 Him
 sleeping
 again
 for
 their
 eyes
 were
 heavy
 and
 when
 awakened
 they
 were
 embarrassed
 or
 ashamed
 so
 that
 they
 wist
 not
 what
 to
 say
 A
 third
 time
 He
 went
 to
 His
 lonely
 vigil
 and
 individual
 struggle
 and
 was
 heard
 to
 implore
 the
 Father
 with
 the
 same
 words
 of
 yearning
 entreaty
 Luke
 tells
 us
 that
 there
 appeared
 an
 angel
 unto
 him
 from
 heaven
 strengthening
 him
 but
 not
 even
 the
 presence
 of
 this
 superearthly
 visitant
 could
 dispel
 the
 awful
 anguish
 of
 His
 soul
 And
 being
 in
 an
 agony
 he
 prayed
 more
 earnestly
 and
 his
 sweat
 was
 as
 it
 were
 great
 drops
 of
 blood
 falling
 down
 to
 the
 ground
 Peter
 had
 had
 a
 glimpse
 of
 the
 darksome
 road
 which
 he
 had
 professed
 himself
 so
 ready
 to
 tread
 and
 the
 brothers
 James
 and
 John
 knew
 now
 better
 than
 before
 how
 unprepared
 they
 were
 to
 drink
 of
 the
 cup
 which
 the
 Lord
 would
 drain
 to
 its
 dregs
 When
 for
 the
 last
 time
 Jesus
 came
 back
 to
 the
 disciples
 left
 on
 guard
 He
 said
 Sleep
 on
 now
 and
 take
 your
 rest
 behold
 the
 hour
 is
 at
 hand
 and
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 is
 betrayed
 into
 the
 hands
 of
 sinners
 There
 was
 no
 use
 of
 further
 watching
 already
 the
 torches
 of
 the
 approaching
 band
 conducted
 by
 Judas
 were
 observable
 in
 the
 distance
 Jesus
 exclaimed
 Rise
 let
 us
 be
 going
 behold
 he
 is
 at
 hand
 that
 doth
 betray
 me
 Standing
 with
 the
 Eleven
 the
 Lord
 calmly
 awaited
 the
 traitors
 coming
 Christs
 agony
 in
 the
 garden
 is
 unfathomable
 by
 the
 finite
 mind
 both
 as
 to
 intensity
 and
 cause
 The
 thought
 that
 He
 suffered
 through
 fear
 of
 death
 is
 untenable
 Death
 to
 Him
 was
 preliminary
 to
 resurrection
 and
 triumphal
 return
 to
 the
 Father
 from
 whom
 He
 had
 come
 and
 to
 a
 state
 of
 glory
 even
 beyond
 what
 He
 had
 before
 possessed
 and
 moreover
 it
 was
 within
 His
 power
 to
 lay
 down
 His
 life
 voluntarily
 He
 struggled
 and
 groaned
 under
 a
 burden
 such
 as
 no
 other
 being
 who
 has
 lived
 on
 earth
 might
 even
 conceive
 as
 possible
 It
 was
 not
 physical
 pain
 nor
 mental
 anguish
 alone
 that
 caused
 Him
 to
 suffer
 such
 torture
 as
 to
 produce
 an
 extrusion
 of
 blood
 from
 every
 pore
 but
 a
 spiritual
 agony
 of
 soul
 such
 as
 only
 God
 was
 capable
 of
 experiencing
 No
 other
 man
 however
 great
 his
 powers
 of
 physical
 or
 mental
 endurance
 could
 have
 suffered
 so
 for
 his
 human
 organism
 would
 have
 succumbed
 and
 syncope
 would
 have
 produced
 unconsciousness
 and
 welcome
 oblivion
 In
 that
 hour
 of
 anguish
 Christ
 met
 and
 overcame
 all
 the
 horrors
 that
 Satan
 the
 prince
 of
 this
 world
 could
 inflict
 The
 frightful
 struggle
 incident
 to
 the
 temptations
 immediately
 following
 the
 Lords
 baptism
 was
 surpassed
 and
 overshadowed
 by
 this
 supreme
 contest
 with
 the
 powers
 of
 evil
 In
 some
 manner
 actual
 and
 terribly
 real
 though
 to
 man
 incomprehensible
 the
 Savior
 took
 upon
 Himself
 the
 burden
 of
 the
 sins
 of
 mankind
 from
 Adam
 to
 the
 end
 of
 the
 world
 Modern
 revelation
 assists
 us
 to
 a
 partial
 understanding
 of
 the
 awful
 experience
 In
 March
 
 the
 glorified
 Lord
 Jesus
 Christ
 thus
 spake
 For
 behold
 I
 God
 have
 suffered
 these
 things
 for
 all
 that
 they
 might
 not
 suffer
 if
 they
 would
 repent
 but
 if
 they
 would
 not
 repent
 they
 must
 suffer
 even
 as
 I
 which
 suffering
 caused
 myself
 even
 God
 the
 greatest
 of
 all
 to
 tremble
 because
 of
 pain
 and
 to
 bleed
 at
 every
 pore
 and
 to
 suffer
 both
 body
 and
 spirit
 and
 would
 that
 I
 might
 not
 drink
 the
 bitter
 cup
 and
 shrink
 nevertheless
 glory
 be
 to
 the
 Father
 and
 I
 partook
 and
 finished
 my
 preparations
 unto
 the
 children
 of
 men
 From
 the
 terrible
 conflict
 in
 Gethsemane
 Christ
 emerged
 a
 victor
 Though
 in
 the
 dark
 tribulation
 of
 that
 fearful
 hour
 He
 had
 pleaded
 that
 the
 bitter
 cup
 be
 removed
 from
 His
 lips
 the
 request
 however
 oft
 repeated
 was
 always
 conditional
 the
 accomplishment
 of
 the
 Fathers
 will
 was
 never
 lost
 sight
 of
 as
 the
 object
 of
 the
 Sons
 supreme
 desire
 The
 further
 tragedy
 of
 the
 night
 and
 the
 cruel
 inflictions
 that
 awaited
 Him
 on
 the
 morrow
 to
 culminate
 in
 the
 frightful
 tortures
 of
 the
 cross
 could
 not
 exceed
 the
 bitter
 anguish
 through
 which
 He
 had
 successfully
 passed
 THE
 BETRAYAL
 AND
 THE
 ARREST
 During
 the
 period
 of
 the
 Lords
 last
 and
 most
 loving
 communion
 with
 the
 Eleven
 Judas
 had
 been
 busy
 in
 his
 treacherous
 conspiracy
 with
 the
 priestly
 authorities
 It
 is
 probable
 that
 the
 determination
 to
 make
 the
 arrest
 that
 night
 was
 reached
 when
 Judas
 reported
 that
 Jesus
 was
 within
 the
 city
 walls
 and
 might
 easily
 be
 apprehended
 The
 Jewish
 rulers
 assembled
 a
 body
 of
 temple
 guardsmen
 or
 police
 and
 obtained
 a
 band
 of
 Roman
 soldiers
 under
 command
 of
 a
 tribune
 this
 band
 or
 cohort
 was
 probably
 a
 detachment
 from
 the
 garrison
 of
 Antonia
 commissioned
 for
 the
 work
 of
 the
 night
 on
 requisition
 of
 the
 chief
 priests
 This
 company
 of
 men
 and
 officers
 representing
 a
 combination
 of
 ecclesiastical
 and
 military
 authority
 set
 forth
 in
 the
 night
 with
 Judas
 at
 their
 head
 intent
 on
 the
 arrest
 of
 Jesus
 They
 were
 equipped
 with
 lanterns
 torches
 and
 weapons
 It
 is
 probable
 that
 they
 were
 first
 conducted
 to
 the
 house
 in
 which
 Judas
 had
 left
 his
 fellow
 apostles
 and
 the
 Lord
 when
 the
 traitor
 had
 been
 dismissed
 and
 that
 finding
 the
 little
 company
 had
 gone
 out
 Judas
 led
 the
 multitude
 to
 Gethsemane
 for
 he
 knew
 the
 place
 and
 knew
 also
 that
 Jesus
 ofttimes
 resorted
 thither
 with
 his
 disciples
 While
 Jesus
 was
 yet
 speaking
 to
 the
 Eleven
 whom
 He
 had
 roused
 from
 slumber
 with
 the
 announcement
 that
 the
 betrayer
 was
 at
 hand
 Judas
 and
 the
 multitude
 approached
 As
 a
 preconcerted
 sign
 of
 identification
 the
 recreant
 Iscariot
 with
 treacherous
 duplicity
 came
 up
 with
 a
 hypocritical
 show
 of
 affection
 saying
 Hail
 master
 and
 profaned
 his
 Lords
 sacred
 face
 with
 a
 kiss
 That
 Jesus
 understood
 the
 treacherous
 significance
 of
 the
 act
 appears
 in
 His
 pathetic
 yet
 piercing
 and
 condemning
 reproach
 Judas
 betrayest
 thou
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 with
 a
 kiss
 Then
 applying
 the
 title
 with
 which
 the
 other
 apostles
 had
 been
 honored
 the
 Lord
 said
 Friend
 do
 that
 for
 which
 thou
 art
 come
 It
 was
 a
 reiteration
 of
 the
 behest
 given
 at
 the
 supper
 table
 That
 thou
 doest
 do
 quickly
 The
 armed
 band
 hesitated
 though
 their
 guide
 had
 given
 the
 signal
 agreed
 upon
 Jesus
 walked
 toward
 the
 officers
 with
 whom
 stood
 Judas
 and
 asked
 Whom
 seek
 ye
 To
 their
 reply
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 the
 Lord
 rejoined
 I
 am
 he
 Instead
 of
 advancing
 to
 take
 Him
 the
 crowd
 pressed
 backward
 and
 many
 of
 them
 fell
 to
 the
 ground
 in
 fright
 The
 simple
 dignity
 and
 gentle
 yet
 compelling
 force
 of
 Christs
 presence
 proved
 more
 potent
 than
 strong
 arms
 and
 weapons
 of
 violence
 Again
 He
 put
 the
 question
 Whom
 seek
 ye
 and
 again
 they
 answered
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 Then
 said
 Jesus
 I
 have
 told
 you
 that
 I
 am
 he
 if
 therefore
 ye
 seek
 me
 let
 these
 go
 their
 way
 The
 last
 remark
 had
 reference
 to
 the
 apostles
 who
 were
 in
 danger
 of
 arrest
 and
 in
 this
 evidence
 of
 Christs
 solicitude
 for
 their
 personal
 safety
 John
 saw
 a
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 Lords
 then
 recent
 utterance
 in
 prayer
 Of
 them
 which
 thou
 gavest
 me
 have
 I
 lost
 none
 It
 is
 possible
 that
 had
 any
 of
 the
 Eleven
 been
 apprehended
 with
 Jesus
 and
 made
 to
 share
 the
 cruel
 abuse
 and
 torturing
 humiliation
 of
 the
 next
 few
 hours
 their
 faith
 might
 have
 failed
 them
 relatively
 immature
 and
 untried
 as
 it
 then
 was
 even
 as
 in
 succeeding
 years
 many
 who
 took
 upon
 themselves
 the
 name
 of
 Christ
 yielded
 to
 persecution
 and
 went
 into
 apostasy
 When
 the
 officers
 approached
 and
 seized
 Jesus
 some
 of
 the
 apostles
 ready
 to
 fight
 and
 die
 for
 their
 beloved
 Master
 asked
 Lord
 shall
 we
 smite
 with
 the
 sword
 Peter
 waiting
 not
 for
 a
 reply
 drew
 his
 sword
 and
 delivered
 a
 poorly
 aimed
 stroke
 at
 the
 head
 of
 one
 of
 the
 nearest
 of
 the
 crowd
 whose
 ear
 was
 severed
 by
 the
 blade
 The
 man
 thus
 wounded
 was
 Malchus
 a
 servant
 of
 the
 high
 priest
 Jesus
 asking
 liberty
 of
 His
 captors
 by
 the
 simple
 request
 Suffer
 ye
 thus
 far
 stepped
 forward
 and
 healed
 the
 injured
 man
 by
 a
 touch
 Turning
 to
 Peter
 the
 Lord
 rebuked
 his
 rashness
 and
 commanded
 him
 to
 return
 the
 sword
 to
 its
 scabbard
 with
 the
 reminder
 that
 all
 they
 that
 take
 the
 sword
 shall
 perish
 with
 the
 sword
 Then
 to
 show
 the
 needlessness
 of
 armed
 resistance
 and
 to
 emphasize
 the
 fact
 that
 He
 was
 submitting
 voluntarily
 and
 in
 accordance
 with
 foreseen
 and
 predicted
 developments
 the
 Lord
 continued
 Thinkest
 thou
 that
 I
 cannot
 now
 pray
 to
 my
 Father
 and
 he
 shall
 presently
 give
 me
 more
 than
 twelve
 legions
 of
 angels
 But
 how
 then
 shall
 the
 scriptures
 be
 fulfilled
 that
 thus
 it
 must
 be
 And
 further
 the
 cup
 which
 my
 Father
 hath
 given
 me
 shall
 I
 not
 drink
 it
 But
 though
 surrendering
 Himself
 unresistingly
 Jesus
 was
 not
 unmindful
 of
 His
 rights
 and
 to
 the
 priestly
 officials
 chief
 priests
 captain
 of
 the
 temple
 guard
 and
 elders
 of
 the
 people
 who
 were
 present
 He
 voiced
 this
 interrogative
 protest
 against
 the
 illegal
 night
 seizure
 Are
 ye
 come
 out
 as
 against
 a
 thief
 with
 swords
 and
 staves
 for
 to
 take
 me
 I
 sat
 daily
 with
 you
 teaching
 in
 the
 temple
 and
 ye
 laid
 no
 hold
 on
 me
 But
 all
 this
 was
 done
 that
 the
 scriptures
 of
 the
 prophets
 might
 be
 fulfilled
 Luke
 records
 the
 Lords
 concluding
 words
 thus
 but
 this
 is
 your
 hour
 and
 the
 power
 of
 darkness
 Unheeding
 His
 question
 and
 without
 deference
 to
 His
 submissive
 demeanor
 the
 captain
 and
 the
 officers
 of
 the
 Jews
 bound
 Jesus
 with
 cords
 and
 led
 Him
 away
 a
 Prisoner
 at
 the
 mercy
 of
 His
 deadliest
 enemies
 The
 eleven
 apostles
 seeing
 that
 resistance
 was
 useless
 not
 only
 on
 account
 of
 disparity
 of
 numbers
 and
 supply
 of
 weapons
 but
 chiefly
 because
 of
 Christs
 determination
 to
 submit
 turned
 and
 fled
 Every
 one
 of
 them
 forsook
 Him
 even
 as
 He
 had
 foretold
 That
 they
 were
 really
 in
 jeopardy
 is
 shown
 by
 an
 incident
 preserved
 by
 Mark
 alone
 An
 unnamed
 young
 man
 aroused
 from
 sleep
 by
 the
 tumult
 of
 the
 marching
 band
 had
 sallied
 forth
 with
 no
 outer
 covering
 but
 a
 linen
 sheet
 His
 interest
 in
 the
 arrest
 of
 Jesus
 and
 his
 close
 approach
 caused
 some
 of
 the
 guardsmen
 or
 soldiers
 to
 seize
 him
 but
 he
 broke
 loose
 and
 escaped
 leaving
 the
 sheet
 in
 their
 hands
 NOTES

 CHAPTER
 
 
 The
 Day
 of
 the
 Passover
 FeastControversy
 has
 been
 rife
 for
 many
 centuries
 as
 to
 the
 day
 of
 the
 passover
 feast
 in
 the
 week
 of
 our
 Lords
 death
 That
 He
 was
 crucified
 on
 Friday
 the
 day
 before
 the
 Jewish
 Sabbath
 and
 that
 He
 rose
 a
 resurrected
 Being
 on
 Sunday
 the
 day
 following
 the
 Sabbath
 of
 the
 Jews
 are
 facts
 attested
 by
 the
 four
 Gospelwriters
 From
 the
 three
 synoptists
 we
 infer
 that
 the
 last
 supper
 occurred
 on
 the
 evening
 of
 the
 first
 day
 of
 unleavened
 bread
 and
 therefore
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 Jewish
 Friday
 That
 the
 Lords
 last
 supper
 was
 regarded
 by
 Himself
 and
 the
 apostles
 as
 a
 passover
 meal
 appears
 from
 Matt
 
 
 
 
 and
 parallel
 passages
 Mark
 
 Luke
 
 as
 also
 from
 Luke
 
 
 John
 however
 who
 wrote
 after
 the
 synoptists
 and
 who
 probably
 had
 their
 writings
 before
 him
 as
 is
 indicated
 by
 the
 supplementary
 character
 of
 his
 testimony
 or
 Gospel
 intimates
 that
 the
 last
 supper
 of
 which
 Jesus
 and
 the
 Twelve
 partook
 together
 occurred
 before
 the
 Feast
 of
 the
 Passover
 John
 
 
 and
 the
 same
 writer
 informs
 us
 that
 on
 the
 following
 day
 Friday
 the
 Jews
 refrained
 from
 entering
 the
 Roman
 hall
 of
 judgment
 lest
 they
 be
 defiled
 and
 so
 become
 unfit
 to
 eat
 the
 Passover
 
 It
 should
 be
 remembered
 that
 by
 common
 usage
 the
 term
 Passover
 was
 applied
 not
 only
 to
 the
 day
 or
 season
 of
 the
 observance
 but
 to
 the
 meal
 itself
 and
 particularly
 to
 the
 slain
 lamb
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 
 
 Luke
 
 
 
 
 John
 
 compare
 
 Cor
 
 John
 also
 specifies
 that
 the
 day
 of
 the
 crucifixion
 was
 the
 preparation
 of
 the
 passover
 
 and
 that
 the
 next
 day
 which
 was
 Saturday
 the
 Sabbath
 was
 an
 high
 day
 verse
 
 that
 is
 a
 Sabbath
 rendered
 doubly
 sacred
 because
 of
 its
 being
 also
 a
 feast
 day
 Much
 has
 been
 written
 by
 way
 of
 attempt
 to
 explain
 this
 seeming
 discrepancy
 No
 analysis
 of
 the
 divergent
 views
 of
 Biblical
 scholars
 on
 this
 subject
 will
 be
 attempted
 here
 the
 matter
 is
 of
 incidental
 importance
 in
 connection
 with
 the
 fundamental
 facts
 of
 our
 Lords
 betrayal
 and
 crucifixion

 and
 Gresswells
 Dissertations
 Suffice
 it
 here
 to
 say
 that
 the
 apparent
 inconsistency
 may
 be
 explained
 by
 any
 of
 several
 assumptions
 Thus
 first
 and
 very
 probably
 the
 Passover
 referred
 to
 by
 John
 for
 the
 eating
 of
 which
 the
 priests
 were
 desirous
 of
 keeping
 themselves
 free
 from
 Levitical
 defilement
 may
 not
 have
 been
 the
 supper
 at
 which
 the
 paschal
 lamb
 was
 eaten
 but
 the
 supplementary
 meal
 the
 Chagigah
 This
 later
 meal
 the
 flesh
 part
 of
 which
 was
 designated
 as
 a
 sacrifice
 had
 come
 to
 be
 regarded
 with
 veneration
 equal
 to
 that
 attaching
 to
 the
 paschal
 supper
 Secondly
 it
 is
 held
 by
 many
 authorities
 on
 Jewish
 antiquities
 that
 before
 at
 and
 after
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 two
 nights
 were
 devoted
 yearly
 to
 the
 paschal
 observance
 during
 either
 of
 which
 the
 lamb
 might
 be
 eaten
 and
 that
 this
 extension
 of
 time
 had
 been
 made
 in
 consideration
 of
 the
 increased
 population
 which
 necessitated
 the
 ceremonial
 slaughtering
 of
 more
 lambs
 than
 could
 be
 slain
 on
 a
 single
 day
 and
 in
 this
 connection
 it
 is
 interesting
 to
 note
 that
 Josephus
 Wars
 vi
 ch
 
 records
 the
 number
 of
 lambs
 slain
 at
 a
 single
 Passover
 as
 
 In
 the
 same
 paragraph
 Josephus
 states
 that
 the
 lambs
 had
 to
 be
 slain
 between
 the
 ninth
 and
 the
 eleventh
 hour
 
 to
 
 pm
 According
 to
 this
 explanation
 Jesus
 and
 the
 Twelve
 may
 have
 partaken
 of
 the
 passover
 meal
 on
 the
 first
 of
 the
 two
 evenings
 and
 the
 Jews
 who
 next
 day
 feared
 defilement
 may
 have
 deferred
 their
 observance
 until
 the
 second
 Thirdly
 the
 Lords
 last
 paschal
 supper
 may
 have
 been
 eaten
 earlier
 than
 the
 time
 of
 general
 observance
 He
 knowing
 that
 night
 to
 be
 His
 last
 in
 mortality
 Supporters
 of
 this
 view
 explain
 the
 message
 to
 the
 man
 who
 provided
 the
 chamber
 for
 the
 last
 supper
 My
 time
 is
 at
 hand
 Matt
 
 as
 indicating
 a
 special
 urgency
 for
 the
 passover
 observance
 by
 Christ
 and
 the
 apostles
 before
 the
 regularly
 appointed
 day
 Some
 authorities
 assert
 that
 an
 error
 of
 one
 day
 had
 crept
 into
 the
 Jewish
 reckoning
 of
 time
 and
 that
 Jesus
 ate
 the
 passover
 on
 the
 true
 date
 while
 the
 Jews
 were
 a
 day
 behind
 If
 the
 preparation
 of
 the
 passover
 John
 
 on
 Friday
 the
 day
 of
 Christs
 crucifixion
 means
 the
 slaughtering
 of
 the
 paschal
 lambs
 our
 Lord
 the
 real
 sacrifice
 of
 which
 all
 earlier
 altar
 victims
 had
 been
 but
 prototypes
 died
 on
 the
 cross
 while
 the
 passover
 lambs
 were
 being
 slain
 at
 the
 temple
 
 Did
 Judas
 Iscariot
 Partake
 of
 the
 Sacrament
 of
 the
 Lords
 SupperThis
 question
 cannot
 be
 definitely
 answered
 from
 the
 brief
 accounts
 we
 have
 of
 the
 proceedings
 at
 the
 last
 supper
 At
 best
 only
 inference
 not
 conclusion
 is
 possible
 According
 to
 the
 records
 made
 by
 Matthew
 and
 Mark
 the
 Lords
 announcement
 that
 there
 was
 a
 traitor
 among
 the
 Twelve
 was
 made
 early
 in
 the
 course
 of
 the
 meal
 and
 the
 institution
 of
 the
 Sacrament
 occurred
 later
 Luke
 records
 the
 prediction
 of
 treachery
 as
 following
 the
 administering
 of
 the
 sacramental
 bread
 and
 wine
 All
 the
 synoptists
 agree
 that
 the
 Sacrament
 of
 the
 Lords
 Supper
 was
 administered
 before
 the
 sitting
 at
 the
 ordinary
 meal
 had
 broken
 up
 though
 the
 Sacrament
 was
 plainly
 made
 a
 separate
 and
 distinct
 feature
 John
 
 states
 that
 the
 washing
 of
 feet
 occurred
 when
 supper
 was
 ended
 and
 gives
 us
 good
 reason
 for
 inferring
 that
 Judas
 was
 washed
 with
 the
 rest
 verses
 
 
 and
 that
 he
 later
 verses
 
 went
 out
 into
 the
 night
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 betraying
 Jesus
 The
 giving
 of
 a
 sop
 to
 Judas
 verses
 
 
 even
 though
 supper
 was
 practically
 over
 is
 not
 inconsistent
 with
 Johns
 statement
 that
 the
 supper
 proper
 was
 ended
 before
 the
 washing
 of
 feet
 was
 performed
 the
 act
 does
 not
 appear
 to
 have
 been
 so
 unusual
 as
 to
 cause
 surprize
 To
 many
 it
 has
 appeared
 plausible
 that
 because
 of
 his
 utter
 baseness
 Judas
 would
 not
 be
 permitted
 to
 participate
 with
 the
 other
 apostles
 in
 the
 holy
 ordinance
 of
 the
 Sacrament
 others
 infer
 that
 he
 was
 allowed
 to
 partake
 as
 a
 possible
 means
 of
 moving
 him
 to
 abandon
 his
 evil
 purpose
 even
 at
 that
 late
 hour
 or
 of
 filling
 his
 cup
 of
 iniquity
 to
 overflowing
 The
 writers
 personal
 opinion
 is
 based
 on
 the
 last
 conception
 
 Washing
 of
 FeetThe
 ordinance
 of
 the
 washing
 of
 feet
 was
 reestablished
 through
 revelation
 December
 
 
 It
 was
 made
 a
 feature
 of
 admission
 to
 the
 school
 of
 the
 prophets
 and
 detailed
 instructions
 relating
 to
 its
 administration
 were
 given
 see
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 
 Further
 direction
 as
 to
 the
 ordinances
 involving
 washing
 were
 revealed

 Discontinuity
 of
 the
 Lords
 Last
 Discourse
 to
 the
 ApostlesIt
 is
 certain
 that
 part
 of
 the
 discourse
 following
 the
 last
 supper
 was
 delivered
 in
 the
 upper
 room
 where
 Christ
 and
 the
 Twelve
 had
 eaten
 it
 is
 possible
 that
 the
 latter
 portion
 was
 spoken
 and
 the
 prayer
 offered
 John
 
 
 
 outdoors
 as
 Jesus
 and
 the
 Eleven
 wended
 their
 way
 toward
 the
 Mount
 of
 Olives
 The
 th
 chapter
 of
 John
 ends
 with
 Arise
 let
 us
 go
 hence
 the
 next
 chapter
 opens
 with
 another
 section
 of
 the
 discourse
 From
 Matt
 
 and
 Mark
 
 we
 may
 infer
 that
 the
 prediction
 of
 Peters
 denial
 of
 his
 Lord
 was
 made
 as
 the
 little
 company
 walked
 from
 the
 city
 to
 the
 mount
 On
 the
 other
 hand
 John
 
 states
 that
 When
 Jesus
 had
 spoken
 these
 words
 namely
 the
 whole
 discourse
 and
 the
 concluding
 prayer
 he
 went
 forth
 with
 his
 disciples
 over
 the
 brook
 Cedron
 Not
 one
 of
 our
 Lords
 sublime
 utterances
 on
 that
 night
 of
 solemn
 converse
 with
 His
 own
 and
 of
 communion
 between
 Himself
 and
 the
 Father
 is
 affected
 by
 the
 circumstance
 of
 place
 
 GethsemaneThe
 name
 means
 oilpress
 and
 probably
 has
 reference
 to
 a
 mill
 maintained
 at
 the
 place
 for
 the
 extraction
 of
 oil
 from
 the
 olives
 there
 cultivated
 John
 refers
 to
 the
 spot
 as
 a
 garden
 from
 which
 designation
 we
 may
 regard
 it
 as
 an
 enclosed
 space
 of
 private
 ownership
 That
 it
 was
 a
 place
 frequented
 by
 Jesus
 when
 He
 sought
 retirement
 for
 prayer
 or
 opportunity
 for
 confidential
 converse
 with
 the
 disciples
 is
 indicated
 by
 the
 same
 writer
 John
 
 
 
 The
 Bloody
 SweatLuke
 the
 only
 Gospelwriter
 who
 mentions
 sweat
 and
 blood
 in
 connection
 with
 our
 Lords
 agony
 in
 Gethsemane
 states
 that
 his
 sweat
 was
 as
 it
 were
 great
 drops
 of
 blood
 falling
 down
 to
 the
 ground
 
 Many
 critical
 expositors
 deny
 that
 there
 was
 an
 actual
 extrusion
 of
 blood
 on
 the
 grounds
 that
 the
 evangelist
 does
 not
 positively
 affirm
 it
 and
 that
 the
 three
 apostles
 who
 were
 the
 only
 human
 witnesses
 could
 not
 have
 distinguished
 blood
 from
 sweat
 falling
 in
 drops
 as
 they
 watched
 from
 a
 distance
 in
 the
 night
 even
 if
 the
 moon
 which
 at
 the
 passover
 season
 was
 full
 had
 been
 unobscured
 Modern
 scripture
 removes
 all
 doubt

 Suffer
 Ye
 thus
 FarMany
 understand
 these
 words
 uttered
 by
 Jesus
 as
 He
 raised
 His
 hand
 to
 heal
 the
 wounded
 Malchus
 to
 have
 been
 addressed
 to
 the
 disciples
 forbidding
 their
 further
 interference
 Trench
 Miracles
 
 considers
 the
 meaning
 to
 be
 as
 follows
 Hold
 now
 thus
 far
 ye
 have
 gone
 in
 resistance
 but
 let
 it
 be
 no
 further
 no
 more
 of
 this
 The
 disputed
 interpretation
 is
 of
 little
 importance
 as
 to
 the
 bearing
 of
 the
 incident
 on
 the
 events
 that
 followed
 
 The
 Cup
 as
 a
 SymbolOur
 Lords
 frequent
 mention
 of
 His
 foreseen
 sufferings
 as
 the
 cup
 of
 which
 the
 Father
 would
 have
 Him
 drink
 Matt
 
 
 Mark
 
 Luke
 
 John
 
 compare
 Matt
 
 Mark
 
 
 Cor
 
 is
 in
 line
 with
 Old
 Testament
 usage
 of
 the
 term
 cup
 as
 a
 symbolic
 expression
 for
 a
 bitter
 or
 poisonous
 potion
 typifying
 experiences
 of
 suffering
 See

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 TRIAL
 AND
 CONDEMNATION
 THE
 JEWISH
 TRIAL
 From
 Gethsemane
 the
 bound
 and
 captive
 Christ
 was
 haled
 before
 the
 Jewish
 rulers
 John
 alone
 informs
 us
 that
 the
 Lord
 was
 taken
 first
 to
 Annas
 who
 sent
 Him
 still
 bound
 to
 Caiaphas
 the
 high
 priest
 the
 synoptists
 record
 the
 arraignment
 before
 Caiaphas
 only
 No
 details
 of
 the
 interview
 with
 Annas
 are
 of
 record
 and
 the
 bringing
 of
 Jesus
 before
 him
 at
 all
 was
 as
 truly
 irregular
 and
 illegal
 according
 to
 Hebrew
 law
 as
 were
 all
 the
 subsequent
 proceedings
 of
 that
 night
 Annas
 who
 was
 fatherinlaw
 to
 Caiaphas
 had
 been
 deposed
 from
 the
 highpriestly
 office
 over
 twenty
 years
 before
 but
 throughout
 this
 period
 he
 had
 exerted
 a
 potent
 influence
 in
 all
 the
 affairs
 of
 the
 hierarchy
 Caiaphas
 as
 John
 is
 careful
 to
 remind
 us
 was
 he
 which
 gave
 counsel
 to
 the
 Jews
 that
 it
 was
 expedient
 that
 one
 man
 should
 die
 for
 the
 people
 At
 the
 palace
 of
 Caiaphas
 the
 chief
 priests
 scribes
 and
 elders
 of
 the
 people
 were
 assembled
 in
 a
 meeting
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 informal
 or
 otherwise
 all
 eagerly
 awaiting
 the
 result
 of
 the
 expedition
 led
 by
 Judas
 When
 Jesus
 the
 object
 of
 their
 bitter
 hatred
 and
 their
 predetermined
 victim
 was
 brought
 in
 a
 bound
 Prisoner
 He
 was
 immediately
 put
 upon
 trial
 in
 contravention
 of
 the
 law
 both
 written
 and
 traditional
 of
 which
 those
 congregated
 rulers
 of
 the
 Jews
 professed
 to
 be
 such
 zealous
 supporters
 No
 legal
 hearing
 on
 a
 capital
 charge
 could
 lawfully
 be
 held
 except
 in
 the
 appointed
 and
 official
 courtroom
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 From
 the
 account
 given
 in
 the
 fourth
 Gospel
 we
 infer
 that
 the
 Prisoner
 was
 first
 subjected
 to
 an
 interrogative
 examination
 by
 the
 high
 priest
 in
 person
 That
 functionary
 whether
 Annas
 or
 Caiaphas
 is
 a
 matter
 of
 inference
 inquired
 of
 Jesus
 concerning
 His
 disciples
 and
 His
 doctrines
 Such
 a
 preliminary
 inquiry
 was
 utterly
 unlawful
 for
 the
 Hebrew
 code
 provided
 that
 the
 accusing
 witnesses
 in
 any
 cause
 before
 the
 court
 should
 define
 their
 charge
 against
 the
 accused
 and
 that
 the
 latter
 should
 be
 protected
 from
 any
 effort
 to
 make
 him
 testify
 against
 himself
 The
 Lords
 reply
 should
 have
 been
 a
 sufficient
 protest
 to
 the
 high
 priest
 against
 further
 illegal
 procedure
 Jesus
 answered
 him
 I
 spake
 openly
 to
 the
 world
 I
 ever
 taught
 in
 the
 synagogue
 and
 in
 the
 temple
 whither
 the
 Jews
 always
 resort
 and
 in
 secret
 have
 I
 said
 nothing
 Why
 askest
 thou
 meask
 them
 which
 heard
 me
 what
 I
 have
 said
 unto
 them
 behold
 they
 know
 what
 I
 said
 This
 was
 a
 lawful
 objection
 against
 denying
 to
 a
 prisoner
 on
 trial
 his
 right
 to
 be
 confronted
 by
 his
 accusers
 It
 was
 received
 with
 open
 disdain
 and
 one
 of
 the
 officers
 who
 stood
 by
 hoping
 perhaps
 to
 curry
 favor
 with
 his
 superiors
 actually
 struck
 Jesus
 a
 vicious
 blow
 accompanied
 by
 the
 question
 Answerest
 thou
 the
 high
 priest
 so
 To
 this
 cowardly
 assault
 the
 Lord
 replied
 with
 almost
 superhuman
 gentleness
 If
 I
 have
 spoken
 evil
 bear
 witness
 of
 the
 evil
 but
 if
 well
 why
 smitest
 thou
 me
 Combined
 with
 submissiveness
 however
 this
 constituted
 another
 appeal
 to
 the
 principles
 of
 justice
 if
 what
 Jesus
 had
 said
 was
 evil
 why
 did
 not
 the
 assailant
 accuse
 Him
 and
 if
 He
 had
 spoken
 well
 what
 right
 had
 a
 police
 officer
 to
 judge
 condemn
 and
 punish
 and
 that
 too
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 high
 priest
 Law
 and
 justice
 had
 been
 dethroned
 that
 night
 Now
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 elders
 and
 all
 the
 council
 sought
 false
 witness
 against
 Jesus
 to
 put
 him
 to
 death
 Whether
 all
 the
 council
 means
 a
 legal
 quorum
 which
 would
 be
 twentythree
 or
 more
 or
 a
 full
 attendance
 of
 the
 seventytwo
 Sanhedrists
 is
 of
 small
 importance
 Any
 sitting
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 at
 night
 and
 more
 particularly
 for
 the
 consideration
 of
 a
 capital
 charge
 was
 directly
 in
 violation
 of
 Jewish
 law
 Likewise
 was
 it
 unlawful
 for
 the
 council
 to
 consider
 such
 a
 charge
 on
 a
 Sabbath
 a
 feast
 day
 or
 on
 the
 eve
 of
 any
 such
 day
 In
 the
 Sanhedrin
 every
 member
 was
 a
 judge
 the
 judicial
 body
 was
 to
 hear
 the
 testimony
 and
 according
 to
 that
 testimony
 and
 nought
 else
 render
 a
 decision
 on
 every
 case
 duly
 presented
 The
 accusers
 were
 required
 to
 appear
 in
 person
 and
 they
 were
 to
 receive
 a
 preliminary
 warning
 against
 bearing
 false
 witness
 Every
 defendant
 was
 to
 be
 regarded
 and
 treated
 as
 innocent
 until
 convicted
 in
 due
 course
 But
 in
 the
 socalled
 trial
 of
 Jesus
 the
 judges
 not
 only
 sought
 witnesses
 but
 specifically
 tried
 to
 find
 false
 witnesses
 Though
 many
 false
 witnesses
 came
 yet
 there
 was
 no
 witness
 or
 testimony
 against
 the
 Prisoner
 for
 the
 suborned
 perjurers
 failed
 to
 agree
 among
 themselves
 and
 even
 the
 lawless
 Sanhedrists
 hesitated
 to
 openly
 violate
 the
 fundamental
 requirement
 that
 at
 least
 two
 concordant
 witnesses
 must
 testify
 against
 an
 accused
 person
 for
 otherwise
 the
 case
 had
 to
 be
 dismissed
 That
 Jesus
 was
 to
 be
 convicted
 on
 some
 charge
 or
 other
 and
 be
 put
 to
 death
 had
 been
 already
 determined
 by
 the
 priestly
 judges
 their
 failure
 to
 find
 witnesses
 against
 Him
 threatened
 to
 delay
 the
 carrying
 out
 of
 their
 nefarious
 scheme
 Haste
 and
 precipitancy
 characterized
 their
 procedure
 throughout
 they
 had
 unlawfully
 caused
 Jesus
 to
 be
 arrested
 at
 night
 they
 were
 illegally
 going
 through
 the
 semblance
 of
 a
 trial
 at
 night
 their
 purpose
 was
 to
 convict
 the
 Prisoner
 in
 time
 to
 have
 Him
 brought
 before
 the
 Roman
 authorities
 as
 early
 as
 possible
 in
 the
 morningas
 a
 criminal
 duly
 tried
 and
 adjudged
 worthy
 of
 death
 The
 lack
 of
 two
 hostile
 witnesses
 who
 would
 tell
 the
 same
 falsehoods
 was
 a
 serious
 hindrance
 But
 at
 the
 last
 came
 two
 false
 witnesses
 and
 said
 This
 fellow
 said
 I
 am
 able
 to
 destroy
 the
 temple
 of
 God
 and
 to
 build
 it
 in
 three
 days
 Others
 however
 testified
 We
 heard
 him
 say
 I
 will
 destroy
 this
 temple
 that
 is
 made
 with
 hands
 and
 within
 three
 days
 I
 will
 build
 another
 made
 without
 hands
 And
 so
 as
 Mark
 observes
 even
 in
 this
 particular
 their
 witness
 or
 testimony
 did
 not
 agree
 Surely
 in
 a
 case
 at
 bar
 such
 discrepancy
 as
 appears
 between
 I
 am
 able
 to
 and
 I
 will
 as
 alleged
 utterances
 of
 the
 accused
 is
 of
 vital
 importance
 Yet
 this
 semblance
 of
 formal
 accusation
 was
 the
 sole
 basis
 of
 a
 charge
 against
 Christ
 up
 to
 this
 stage
 of
 the
 trial
 It
 will
 be
 remembered
 that
 in
 connection
 with
 the
 first
 clearing
 of
 the
 temple
 near
 the
 commencement
 of
 Christs
 ministry
 He
 had
 answered
 the
 clamorous
 demand
 of
 the
 Jews
 for
 a
 sign
 of
 His
 authority
 by
 saying
 Destroy
 this
 temple
 and
 in
 three
 days
 I
 will
 raise
 it
 up
 He
 spoke
 not
 at
 all
 of
 Himself
 as
 the
 one
 who
 would
 destroy
 the
 Jews
 were
 to
 be
 the
 destroyers
 He
 the
 restorer
 But
 the
 inspired
 writer
 is
 particular
 to
 explain
 that
 Jesus
 spake
 of
 the
 temple
 of
 his
 body
 and
 not
 at
 all
 of
 those
 buildings
 reared
 by
 man
 One
 may
 reasonably
 inquire
 as
 to
 what
 serious
 import
 could
 be
 attached
 to
 even
 such
 a
 declaration
 as
 the
 perjured
 witnesses
 claimed
 to
 have
 heard
 from
 the
 lips
 of
 Christ
 The
 veneration
 with
 which
 the
 Jews
 professed
 to
 regard
 the
 Holy
 House
 however
 wantonly
 they
 profaned
 its
 precincts
 offers
 a
 partial
 but
 insufficient
 answer
 The
 plan
 of
 the
 conspiring
 rulers
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 that
 of
 convicting
 Christ
 on
 a
 charge
 of
 sedition
 making
 Him
 out
 to
 be
 a
 dangerous
 disturber
 of
 the
 nations
 peace
 an
 assailant
 of
 established
 institutions
 and
 consequently
 an
 inciter
 of
 opposition
 against
 the
 vassal
 autonomy
 of
 the
 Jewish
 nation
 and
 the
 supreme
 dominion
 of
 Rome
 The
 vaguely
 defined
 shadow
 of
 legal
 accusation
 produced
 by
 the
 dark
 and
 inconsistent
 testimony
 of
 the
 false
 witnesses
 was
 enough
 to
 embolden
 the
 iniquitous
 court
 Caiaphas
 rising
 from
 his
 seat
 to
 give
 dramatic
 emphasis
 to
 his
 question
 demanded
 of
 Jesus
 Answerest
 thou
 nothing
 what
 is
 it
 which
 these
 witness
 against
 thee
 There
 was
 nothing
 to
 answer
 No
 consistent
 or
 valid
 testimony
 had
 been
 presented
 against
 Him
 therefore
 He
 stood
 in
 dignified
 silence
 Then
 Caiaphas
 in
 violation
 of
 the
 legal
 proscription
 against
 requiring
 any
 person
 to
 testify
 in
 his
 own
 case
 except
 voluntarily
 and
 on
 his
 own
 initiative
 not
 only
 demanded
 an
 answer
 from
 the
 Prisoner
 but
 exercized
 the
 potent
 prerogative
 of
 the
 highpriestly
 office
 to
 put
 the
 accused
 under
 oath
 as
 a
 witness
 before
 the
 sacerdotal
 court
 And
 the
 high
 priest
 answered
 and
 said
 unto
 him
 I
 adjure
 thee
 by
 the
 living
 God
 that
 thou
 tell
 us
 whether
 thou
 be
 the
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 The
 fact
 of
 a
 distinct
 specification
 of
 the
 Christ
 and
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 is
 significant
 in
 that
 it
 implies
 the
 Jewish
 expectation
 of
 a
 Messiah
 but
 does
 not
 acknowledge
 that
 He
 was
 to
 be
 distinctively
 of
 divine
 origin
 Nothing
 that
 had
 gone
 before
 can
 be
 construed
 as
 a
 proper
 foundation
 for
 this
 inquiry
 The
 charge
 of
 sedition
 was
 about
 to
 be
 superseded
 by
 one
 of
 greater
 enormitythat
 of
 blasphemy
 To
 the
 utterly
 unjust
 yet
 official
 adjuration
 of
 the
 high
 priest
 Jesus
 answered
 Thou
 hast
 said
 nevertheless
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Hereafter
 shall
 ye
 see
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 sitting
 on
 the
 right
 hand
 of
 power
 and
 coming
 in
 the
 clouds
 of
 heaven
 This
 expression
 Thou
 hast
 said
 was
 equivalent
 toI
 am
 what
 thou
 hast
 said
 It
 was
 an
 unqualified
 avowal
 of
 divine
 parentage
 and
 inherent
 Godship
 Then
 the
 high
 priest
 rent
 his
 clothes
 saying
 He
 hath
 spoken
 blasphemy
 what
 further
 need
 have
 we
 of
 witnesses
 behold
 now
 ye
 have
 heard
 his
 blasphemy
 What
 think
 ye
 They
 answered
 and
 said
 He
 is
 guilty
 of
 death
 Thus
 the
 judges
 in
 Israel
 comprizing
 the
 high
 priest
 the
 chief
 priests
 the
 scribes
 and
 elders
 of
 the
 people
 the
 Great
 Sanhedrin
 unlawfully
 assembled
 decreed
 that
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 was
 deserving
 of
 death
 on
 no
 evidence
 save
 that
 of
 His
 own
 acknowledgment
 By
 express
 provision
 the
 Jewish
 code
 forbade
 the
 conviction
 specifically
 on
 a
 capital
 charge
 of
 any
 person
 on
 his
 own
 confession
 unless
 that
 was
 amply
 supported
 by
 the
 testimony
 of
 trustworthy
 witnesses
 As
 in
 the
 Garden
 of
 Gethsemane
 Jesus
 had
 voluntarily
 surrendered
 Himself
 so
 before
 the
 judges
 did
 He
 personally
 and
 voluntarily
 furnish
 the
 evidence
 upon
 which
 they
 unrighteously
 declared
 Him
 deserving
 of
 death
 There
 could
 be
 no
 crime
 in
 the
 claim
 of
 Messiahship
 or
 divine
 Sonship
 except
 that
 claim
 was
 false
 We
 vainly
 search
 the
 record
 for
 even
 an
 intimation
 that
 inquiry
 was
 made
 or
 suggested
 as
 to
 the
 grounds
 upon
 which
 Jesus
 based
 His
 exalted
 claims
 The
 action
 of
 the
 high
 priest
 in
 rending
 his
 garments
 was
 a
 dramatic
 affectation
 of
 pious
 horror
 at
 the
 blasphemy
 with
 which
 his
 ears
 had
 been
 assailed
 It
 was
 expressly
 forbidden
 in
 the
 law
 that
 the
 high
 priest
 rend
 his
 clothes
 but
 from
 extrascriptural
 writings
 we
 learn
 that
 the
 rending
 of
 garments
 as
 an
 attestation
 of
 most
 grievous
 guilt
 such
 as
 that
 of
 blasphemy
 was
 allowable
 under
 traditional
 rule
 There
 is
 no
 indication
 that
 the
 vote
 of
 the
 judges
 was
 taken
 and
 recorded
 in
 the
 precise
 and
 orderly
 manner
 required
 by
 the
 law
 Jesus
 stood
 convicted
 of
 the
 most
 heinous
 offense
 known
 in
 Jewry
 However
 unjustly
 He
 had
 been
 pronounced
 guilty
 of
 blasphemy
 by
 the
 supreme
 tribunal
 of
 the
 nation
 In
 strict
 accuracy
 we
 cannot
 say
 that
 the
 Sanhedrists
 sentenced
 Christ
 to
 death
 inasmuch
 as
 the
 power
 to
 authoritatively
 pronounce
 capital
 sentences
 had
 been
 taken
 from
 the
 Jewish
 council
 by
 Roman
 decree
 The
 highpriestly
 court
 however
 decided
 that
 Jesus
 was
 worthy
 of
 death
 and
 so
 certified
 when
 they
 handed
 Him
 over
 to
 Pilate
 In
 their
 excess
 of
 malignant
 hate
 Israels
 judges
 abandoned
 their
 Lord
 to
 the
 wanton
 will
 of
 the
 attendant
 varlets
 who
 heaped
 upon
 Him
 every
 indignity
 their
 brutish
 instincts
 could
 suggest
 They
 spurted
 their
 foul
 spittle
 into
 His
 face
 and
 then
 having
 blindfolded
 Him
 amused
 themselves
 by
 smiting
 Him
 again
 and
 again
 saying
 the
 while
 Prophesy
 unto
 us
 thou
 Christ
 Who
 is
 he
 that
 smote
 thee
 The
 miscreant
 crowd
 mocked
 Him
 and
 railed
 upon
 Him
 with
 jeers
 and
 taunts
 and
 branded
 themselves
 as
 blasphemers
 in
 fact
 The
 law
 and
 the
 practise
 of
 the
 time
 required
 that
 any
 person
 found
 guilty
 of
 a
 capital
 offense
 after
 due
 trial
 before
 a
 Jewish
 tribunal
 should
 be
 given
 a
 second
 trial
 on
 the
 following
 day
 and
 at
 this
 later
 hearing
 any
 or
 all
 of
 the
 judges
 who
 had
 before
 voted
 for
 conviction
 could
 reverse
 themselves
 but
 no
 one
 who
 had
 once
 voted
 for
 acquittal
 could
 change
 his
 ballot
 A
 bare
 majority
 was
 sufficient
 for
 acquittal
 but
 more
 than
 a
 majority
 was
 required
 for
 conviction
 By
 a
 provision
 that
 must
 appear
 to
 us
 most
 unusual
 if
 all
 the
 judges
 voted
 for
 conviction
 on
 a
 capital
 charge
 the
 verdict
 was
 not
 to
 stand
 and
 the
 accused
 had
 to
 be
 set
 at
 liberty
 for
 it
 was
 argued
 a
 unanimous
 vote
 against
 a
 prisoner
 indicated
 that
 he
 had
 had
 no
 friend
 or
 defender
 in
 court
 and
 that
 the
 judges
 might
 have
 been
 in
 conspiracy
 against
 Him
 Under
 this
 rule
 in
 Hebrew
 jurisprudence
 the
 verdict
 against
 Jesus
 rendered
 at
 the
 illegal
 night
 session
 of
 the
 Sanhedrists
 was
 void
 for
 we
 are
 specifically
 told
 that
 they
 all
 condemned
 him
 to
 be
 guilty
 of
 death
 Apparently
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 establishing
 a
 shadowy
 pretext
 of
 legality
 in
 their
 procedure
 the
 Sanhedrists
 adjourned
 to
 meet
 again
 in
 early
 daylight
 Thus
 they
 technically
 complied
 with
 the
 requirementthat
 on
 every
 case
 in
 which
 the
 death
 sentence
 had
 been
 decreed
 the
 court
 should
 hear
 and
 judge
 a
 second
 time
 in
 a
 later
 sessionbut
 they
 completely
 ignored
 the
 equally
 mandatory
 provision
 that
 the
 second
 trial
 must
 be
 conducted
 on
 the
 day
 following
 that
 of
 the
 first
 hearing
 Between
 the
 two
 sittings
 on
 consecutive
 days
 the
 judges
 were
 required
 to
 fast
 and
 pray
 and
 to
 give
 the
 case
 on
 trial
 calm
 and
 earnest
 consideration
 Luke
 who
 records
 no
 details
 of
 the
 night
 trial
 of
 Jesus
 is
 the
 only
 Gospelwriter
 to
 give
 place
 to
 a
 circumstantial
 report
 of
 the
 morning
 session
 He
 says
 And
 as
 soon
 as
 it
 was
 day
 the
 elders
 of
 the
 people
 and
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 the
 scribes
 came
 together
 and
 led
 him
 into
 their
 council
 Some
 Biblical
 scholars
 have
 construed
 the
 expression
 led
 him
 into
 their
 council
 as
 signifying
 that
 Jesus
 was
 condemned
 by
 the
 Sanhedrin
 in
 the
 appointed
 meetingplace
 of
 the
 court
 viz
 Gazith
 or
 the
 Hall
 of
 Hewn
 Stones
 as
 the
 law
 of
 the
 time
 required
 but
 against
 this
 we
 have
 the
 statement
 of
 John
 that
 they
 led
 Jesus
 directly
 from
 Caiaphas
 to
 the
 Roman
 hall
 of
 judgment
 It
 is
 probable
 that
 at
 this
 early
 daylight
 session
 the
 irregular
 proceedings
 of
 the
 dark
 hours
 were
 approved
 and
 the
 details
 of
 further
 procedure
 decided
 upon
 They
 took
 counsel
 against
 Jesus
 to
 put
 him
 to
 death
 nevertheless
 they
 went
 through
 the
 form
 of
 a
 second
 trial
 the
 issue
 of
 which
 was
 greatly
 facilitated
 by
 the
 Prisoners
 voluntary
 affirmations
 The
 judges
 stand
 without
 semblance
 of
 justification
 for
 calling
 upon
 the
 Accused
 to
 testify
 they
 should
 have
 examined
 anew
 the
 witnesses
 against
 Him
 The
 first
 question
 put
 to
 Him
 was
 Art
 thou
 the
 Christ
 tell
 us
 The
 Lord
 made
 dignified
 reply
 If
 I
 tell
 you
 ye
 will
 not
 believe
 and
 if
 I
 also
 ask
 you
 ye
 will
 not
 answer
 me
 nor
 let
 me
 go
 Hereafter
 shall
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 sit
 on
 the
 right
 hand
 of
 the
 power
 of
 God
 Neither
 did
 the
 question
 imply
 nor
 the
 answer
 furnish
 cause
 for
 condemnation
 The
 whole
 nation
 was
 looking
 for
 the
 Messiah
 and
 if
 Jesus
 claimed
 to
 be
 He
 the
 only
 proper
 judicial
 action
 would
 be
 that
 of
 inquiring
 into
 the
 merit
 of
 the
 claim
 The
 crucial
 question
 followed
 immediately
 Art
 thou
 then
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 And
 he
 said
 unto
 them
 Ye
 say
 that
 I
 am
 And
 they
 said
 What
 need
 we
 any
 further
 witness
 for
 we
 ourselves
 have
 heard
 of
 his
 own
 mouth
 Jehovah
 was
 convicted
 of
 blasphemy
 against
 Jehovah
 The
 only
 mortal
 Being
 to
 whom
 the
 awful
 crime
 of
 blasphemy
 in
 claiming
 divine
 attributes
 and
 powers
 was
 impossible
 stood
 before
 the
 judges
 of
 Israel
 condemned
 as
 a
 blasphemer
 The
 whole
 council
 by
 which
 expression
 we
 may
 possibly
 understand
 a
 legal
 quorum
 was
 concerned
 in
 the
 final
 action
 Thus
 ended
 the
 miscalled
 trial
 of
 Jesus
 before
 the
 highpriest
 and
 elders
 of
 His
 people
 And
 straightway
 in
 the
 morning
 the
 chief
 priests
 held
 a
 consultation
 with
 the
 elders
 and
 scribes
 and
 the
 whole
 council
 and
 bound
 Jesus
 and
 carried
 him
 away
 and
 delivered
 him
 to
 Pilate
 During
 the
 few
 hours
 that
 remained
 to
 Him
 in
 mortality
 He
 would
 be
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 the
 Gentiles
 betrayed
 and
 delivered
 up
 by
 His
 own
 PETERS
 DENIAL
 OF
 HIS
 LORD
 When
 Jesus
 was
 taken
 into
 custody
 in
 the
 Garden
 of
 Gethsemane
 all
 the
 Eleven
 forsook
 Him
 and
 fled
 This
 is
 not
 to
 be
 accounted
 as
 certain
 evidence
 of
 cowardice
 for
 the
 Lord
 had
 indicated
 that
 they
 should
 go
 Peter
 and
 at
 least
 one
 other
 disciple
 followed
 afar
 off
 and
 after
 the
 armed
 guard
 had
 entered
 the
 palace
 of
 the
 high
 priest
 with
 their
 Prisoner
 Peter
 went
 in
 and
 sat
 with
 the
 servants
 to
 see
 the
 end
 He
 was
 assisted
 in
 securing
 admittance
 by
 the
 unnamed
 disciple
 who
 was
 on
 terms
 of
 acquaintanceship
 with
 the
 high
 priest
 That
 other
 disciple
 was
 in
 all
 probability
 John
 as
 may
 be
 inferred
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 is
 mentioned
 only
 in
 the
 fourth
 Gospel
 the
 author
 of
 which
 characteristically
 refers
 to
 himself
 anonymously
 While
 Jesus
 was
 before
 the
 Sanhedrists
 Peter
 remained
 below
 with
 the
 servants
 The
 attendant
 at
 the
 door
 was
 a
 young
 woman
 her
 feminine
 suspicions
 had
 been
 aroused
 when
 she
 admitted
 Peter
 and
 as
 he
 sat
 with
 a
 crowd
 in
 the
 palace
 court
 she
 came
 up
 and
 having
 intently
 observed
 him
 said
 Thou
 also
 wast
 with
 Jesus
 of
 Galilee
 But
 Peter
 denied
 averring
 he
 did
 not
 know
 Jesus
 Peter
 was
 restless
 his
 conscience
 and
 the
 fear
 of
 identification
 as
 one
 of
 the
 Lords
 disciples
 troubled
 him
 He
 left
 the
 crowd
 and
 sought
 partial
 seclusion
 in
 the
 porch
 but
 there
 another
 maid
 spied
 him
 out
 and
 said
 to
 those
 nearby
 This
 fellow
 was
 also
 with
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 to
 which
 accusation
 Peter
 replied
 with
 an
 oath
 I
 do
 not
 know
 the
 man
 The
 April
 night
 was
 chilly
 and
 an
 open
 fire
 had
 been
 made
 in
 the
 hall
 or
 court
 of
 the
 palace
 Peter
 sat
 with
 others
 at
 the
 fire
 thinking
 perhaps
 that
 brazen
 openness
 was
 better
 than
 skulking
 caution
 as
 a
 possible
 safeguard
 against
 detection
 About
 an
 hour
 after
 his
 former
 denials
 some
 of
 the
 men
 around
 the
 fire
 charged
 him
 with
 being
 a
 disciple
 of
 Jesus
 and
 referred
 to
 his
 Galilean
 dialect
 as
 evidence
 that
 he
 was
 at
 least
 a
 fellow
 countryman
 with
 the
 high
 priests
 Prisoner
 but
 most
 threatening
 of
 all
 a
 kinsman
 of
 Malchus
 whose
 ear
 Peter
 had
 slashed
 with
 the
 sword
 asked
 peremptorily
 Did
 not
 I
 see
 thee
 in
 the
 garden
 with
 him
 Then
 Peter
 went
 so
 far
 in
 the
 course
 of
 falsehood
 upon
 which
 he
 had
 entered
 as
 to
 curse
 and
 swear
 and
 to
 vehemently
 declare
 for
 the
 third
 time
 I
 know
 not
 the
 man
 As
 the
 last
 profane
 falsehood
 left
 his
 lips
 the
 clear
 notes
 of
 a
 crowing
 cock
 broke
 upon
 his
 ears
 and
 the
 remembrance
 of
 his
 Lords
 prediction
 welled
 up
 in
 his
 mind
 Trembling
 in
 wretched
 realization
 of
 his
 perfidious
 cowardice
 he
 turned
 from
 the
 crowd
 and
 met
 the
 gaze
 of
 the
 suffering
 Christ
 who
 from
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 insolent
 mob
 looked
 into
 the
 face
 of
 His
 boastful
 yet
 loving
 but
 weak
 apostle
 Hastening
 from
 the
 palace
 Peter
 went
 out
 into
 the
 night
 weeping
 bitterly
 As
 his
 later
 life
 attests
 his
 tears
 were
 those
 of
 real
 contrition
 and
 true
 repentance
 CHRISTS
 FIRST
 APPEARANCE
 BEFORE
 PILATE
 As
 we
 have
 already
 learned
 no
 Jewish
 tribunal
 had
 authority
 to
 inflict
 the
 death
 penalty
 imperial
 Rome
 had
 reserved
 this
 prerogative
 as
 her
 own
 The
 united
 acclaim
 of
 the
 Sanhedrists
 that
 Jesus
 was
 deserving
 of
 death
 would
 be
 ineffective
 until
 sanctioned
 by
 the
 emperors
 deputy
 who
 at
 that
 time
 was
 Pontius
 Pilate
 the
 governor
 or
 more
 properly
 procurator
 of
 Judea
 Samaria
 and
 Idumea
 Pilate
 maintained
 his
 official
 residence
 at
 Csarea
 on
 the
 Mediterranean
 shore
 but
 it
 was
 his
 custom
 to
 be
 present
 in
 Jerusalem
 at
 the
 times
 of
 the
 great
 Hebrew
 feasts
 probably
 in
 the
 interest
 of
 preserving
 order
 or
 of
 promptly
 quelling
 any
 disturbance
 amongst
 the
 vast
 and
 heterogeneous
 multitudes
 by
 which
 the
 city
 was
 thronged
 on
 these
 festive
 occasions
 The
 governor
 with
 his
 attendants
 was
 in
 Jerusalem
 at
 this
 momentous
 Passover
 season
 Early
 on
 Friday
 morning
 the
 whole
 council
 that
 is
 to
 say
 the
 Sanhedrin
 led
 Jesus
 bound
 to
 the
 judgment
 hall
 of
 Pontius
 Pilate
 but
 with
 strict
 scrupulosity
 they
 refrained
 from
 entering
 the
 hall
 lest
 they
 become
 defiled
 for
 the
 judgment
 chamber
 was
 part
 of
 the
 house
 of
 a
 Gentile
 and
 somewhere
 therein
 might
 be
 leavened
 bread
 even
 to
 be
 near
 which
 would
 render
 them
 ceremonially
 unclean
 Let
 every
 one
 designate
 for
 himself
 the
 character
 of
 men
 afraid
 of
 the
 mere
 proximity
 of
 leaven
 while
 thirsting
 for
 innocent
 blood
 In
 deference
 to
 their
 scruples
 Pilate
 came
 out
 from
 the
 palace
 and
 as
 they
 delivered
 up
 to
 him
 their
 Prisoner
 asked
 What
 accusation
 bring
 ye
 against
 this
 man
 The
 question
 though
 strictly
 proper
 and
 judicially
 necessary
 surprized
 and
 disappointed
 the
 priestly
 rulers
 who
 evidently
 had
 expected
 that
 the
 governor
 would
 simply
 approve
 their
 verdict
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 form
 and
 give
 sentence
 accordingly
 but
 instead
 of
 doing
 so
 Pilate
 was
 apparently
 about
 to
 exercize
 his
 authority
 of
 original
 jurisdiction
 With
 poorly
 concealed
 chagrin
 their
 spokesman
 probably
 Caiaphas
 answered
 If
 he
 were
 not
 a
 malefactor
 we
 would
 not
 have
 delivered
 him
 up
 unto
 thee
 It
 was
 now
 Pilates
 turn
 to
 feel
 or
 at
 least
 to
 feign
 umbrage
 and
 he
 replied
 in
 effect
 Oh
 very
 well
 if
 you
 dont
 care
 to
 present
 the
 charge
 in
 proper
 order
 take
 ye
 him
 and
 judge
 him
 according
 to
 your
 law
 dont
 trouble
 me
 with
 the
 matter
 But
 the
 Jews
 rejoined
 It
 is
 not
 lawful
 for
 us
 to
 put
 any
 man
 to
 death
 John
 the
 apostle
 intimates
 in
 this
 last
 remark
 a
 determination
 on
 the
 part
 of
 the
 Jews
 to
 have
 Jesus
 put
 to
 death
 not
 only
 by
 Roman
 sanction
 but
 by
 Roman
 executioners
 for
 as
 we
 readily
 may
 see
 had
 Pilate
 approved
 the
 death
 sentence
 and
 handed
 the
 Prisoner
 over
 to
 the
 Jews
 for
 its
 infliction
 Jesus
 would
 have
 been
 stoned
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 Hebrew
 penalty
 for
 blasphemy
 whereas
 the
 Lord
 had
 plainly
 foretold
 that
 His
 death
 would
 be
 by
 crucifixion
 which
 was
 a
 Roman
 method
 of
 execution
 but
 one
 never
 practised
 by
 the
 Jews
 Furthermore
 if
 Jesus
 had
 been
 put
 to
 death
 by
 the
 Jewish
 rulers
 even
 with
 governmental
 sanction
 an
 insurrection
 among
 the
 people
 might
 have
 resulted
 for
 there
 were
 many
 who
 believed
 on
 Him
 The
 crafty
 hierarchs
 were
 determined
 to
 bring
 about
 His
 death
 under
 Roman
 condemnation
 And
 they
 began
 to
 accuse
 him
 saying
 We
 found
 this
 fellow
 perverting
 the
 nation
 and
 forbidding
 to
 give
 tribute
 to
 Csar
 saying
 that
 he
 himself
 is
 Christ
 a
 King
 It
 is
 important
 to
 note
 that
 no
 accusation
 of
 blasphemy
 was
 made
 to
 Pilate
 had
 such
 been
 presented
 the
 governor
 thoroughly
 pagan
 in
 heart
 and
 mind
 would
 probably
 have
 dismissed
 the
 charge
 as
 utterly
 unworthy
 of
 a
 hearing
 for
 Rome
 with
 her
 many
 gods
 whose
 number
 was
 being
 steadily
 increased
 by
 current
 heathen
 deification
 of
 mortals
 knew
 no
 such
 offense
 as
 blasphemy
 in
 the
 Jewish
 sense
 The
 accusing
 Sanhedrists
 hesitated
 not
 to
 substitute
 for
 blasphemy
 which
 was
 the
 greatest
 crime
 known
 to
 the
 Hebrew
 code
 the
 charge
 of
 high
 treason
 which
 was
 the
 gravest
 offense
 listed
 in
 the
 Roman
 category
 of
 crimes
 To
 the
 vociferous
 accusations
 of
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 elders
 the
 calm
 and
 dignified
 Christ
 deigned
 no
 reply
 To
 them
 He
 had
 spoken
 for
 the
 last
 timeuntil
 the
 appointed
 season
 of
 another
 trial
 in
 which
 He
 shall
 be
 the
 Judge
 and
 they
 the
 prisoners
 at
 the
 bar
 Pilate
 was
 surprized
 at
 the
 submissive
 yet
 majestic
 demeanor
 of
 Jesus
 there
 was
 certainly
 much
 that
 was
 kingly
 about
 the
 Man
 never
 before
 had
 such
 a
 One
 stood
 before
 him
 The
 charge
 however
 was
 a
 serious
 one
 men
 who
 claimed
 title
 to
 kingship
 might
 prove
 dangerous
 to
 Rome
 yet
 to
 the
 charge
 the
 Accused
 answered
 nothing
 Entering
 the
 judgment
 hall
 Pilate
 had
 Jesus
 called
 That
 some
 of
 the
 disciples
 and
 among
 them
 almost
 certainly
 John
 also
 went
 in
 is
 apparent
 from
 the
 detailed
 accounts
 of
 the
 proceedings
 preserved
 in
 the
 fourth
 Gospel
 Anyone
 was
 at
 liberty
 to
 enter
 for
 publicity
 was
 an
 actual
 and
 a
 widely
 proclaimed
 feature
 of
 Roman
 trials
 Pilate
 plainly
 without
 animosity
 or
 prejudice
 against
 Jesus
 asked
 Art
 thou
 the
 King
 of
 the
 Jews
 Jesus
 answered
 him
 Sayest
 thou
 this
 thing
 of
 thyself
 or
 did
 others
 tell
 it
 thee
 of
 me
 The
 Lords
 counterquestion
 as
 Pilates
 rejoinder
 shows
 meant
 and
 was
 understood
 to
 mean
 as
 we
 might
 state
 it
 Do
 you
 ask
 this
 in
 the
 Roman
 and
 literal
 senseas
 to
 whether
 I
 am
 a
 king
 of
 an
 earthly
 kingdomor
 with
 the
 Jewish
 and
 more
 spiritual
 meaning
 A
 direct
 answer
 Yes
 would
 have
 been
 true
 in
 the
 Messianic
 sense
 but
 untrue
 in
 the
 worldly
 signification
 and
 No
 could
 have
 been
 inversely
 construed
 as
 true
 or
 untrue
 Pilate
 answered
 Am
 I
 a
 Jew
 Thine
 own
 nation
 and
 the
 chief
 priests
 have
 delivered
 thee
 unto
 me
 what
 hast
 thou
 done
 Jesus
 answered
 My
 kingdom
 is
 not
 of
 this
 world
 if
 my
 kingdom
 were
 of
 this
 world
 then
 would
 my
 servants
 fight
 that
 I
 should
 not
 be
 delivered
 to
 the
 Jews
 but
 now
 is
 my
 kingdom
 not
 from
 hence
 Pilate
 therefore
 said
 unto
 him
 Art
 thou
 a
 king
 then
 Jesus
 answered
 Thou
 sayest
 that
 I
 am
 a
 king
 To
 this
 end
 was
 I
 born
 and
 for
 this
 cause
 came
 I
 into
 the
 world
 that
 I
 should
 bear
 witness
 unto
 the
 truth
 Every
 one
 that
 is
 of
 the
 truth
 heareth
 my
 voice
 It
 was
 clear
 to
 the
 Roman
 governor
 that
 this
 wonderful
 Man
 with
 His
 exalted
 views
 of
 a
 kingdom
 not
 of
 this
 world
 and
 an
 empire
 of
 truth
 in
 which
 He
 was
 to
 reign
 was
 no
 political
 insurrectionist
 and
 that
 to
 consider
 Him
 a
 menace
 to
 Roman
 institutions
 would
 be
 absurd
 Those
 last
 wordsabout
 truthwere
 of
 all
 the
 most
 puzzling
 Pilate
 was
 restive
 and
 perhaps
 a
 little
 frightened
 under
 their
 import
 What
 is
 truth
 he
 rather
 exclaimed
 in
 apprehension
 than
 inquired
 in
 expectation
 of
 an
 answer
 as
 he
 started
 to
 leave
 the
 hall
 To
 the
 Jews
 without
 he
 announced
 officially
 the
 acquittal
 of
 the
 Prisoner
 I
 find
 in
 him
 no
 fault
 at
 all
 was
 the
 verdict
 But
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 scribes
 and
 elders
 of
 the
 people
 were
 undeterred
 Their
 thirst
 for
 the
 blood
 of
 the
 Holy
 One
 had
 developed
 into
 mania
 Wildly
 and
 fiercely
 they
 shrieked
 He
 stirreth
 up
 the
 people
 teaching
 throughout
 all
 Jewry
 beginning
 from
 Galilee
 to
 this
 place
 The
 mention
 of
 Galilee
 suggested
 to
 Pilate
 a
 new
 course
 of
 procedure
 Having
 confirmed
 by
 inquiry
 that
 Jesus
 was
 a
 Galilean
 he
 determined
 to
 send
 the
 Prisoner
 to
 Herod
 the
 vassal
 ruler
 of
 that
 province
 who
 was
 in
 Jerusalem
 at
 the
 time
 By
 this
 action
 Pilate
 hoped
 to
 rid
 himself
 of
 further
 responsibility
 in
 the
 case
 and
 moreover
 Herod
 with
 whom
 he
 had
 been
 at
 enmity
 might
 be
 placated
 thereby
 CHRIST
 BEFORE
 HEROD
 Herod
 Antipas
 the
 degenerate
 son
 of
 his
 infamous
 sire
 Herod
 the
 Great
 was
 at
 this
 time
 tetrarch
 of
 Galilee
 and
 Perea
 and
 by
 popular
 usage
 though
 without
 imperial
 sanction
 was
 flatteringly
 called
 king
 He
 it
 was
 who
 in
 fulfilment
 of
 an
 unholy
 vow
 inspired
 by
 a
 womans
 voluptuous
 blandishments
 had
 ordered
 the
 murder
 of
 John
 the
 Baptist
 He
 ruled
 as
 a
 Roman
 vassal
 and
 professed
 to
 be
 orthodox
 in
 the
 observances
 of
 Judaism
 He
 had
 come
 up
 to
 Jerusalem
 in
 state
 to
 keep
 the
 feast
 of
 the
 Passover
 Herod
 was
 pleased
 to
 have
 Jesus
 sent
 to
 him
 by
 Pilate
 for
 not
 only
 was
 the
 action
 a
 gracious
 one
 on
 the
 part
 of
 the
 procurator
 constituting
 as
 after
 events
 proved
 a
 preliminary
 to
 reconciliation
 between
 the
 two
 rulers
 but
 it
 was
 a
 means
 of
 gratifying
 Herods
 curiosity
 to
 see
 Jesus
 of
 whom
 he
 had
 heard
 so
 much
 whose
 fame
 had
 terrified
 him
 and
 by
 whom
 he
 now
 hoped
 to
 see
 some
 interesting
 miracle
 wrought
 Whatever
 fear
 Herod
 had
 once
 felt
 regarding
 Jesus
 whom
 he
 had
 superstitiously
 thought
 to
 be
 the
 reincarnation
 of
 his
 murdered
 victim
 John
 the
 Baptist
 was
 replaced
 by
 amused
 interest
 when
 he
 saw
 the
 farfamed
 Prophet
 of
 Galilee
 in
 bonds
 before
 him
 attended
 by
 a
 Roman
 guard
 and
 accompanied
 by
 ecclesiastical
 officials
 Herod
 began
 to
 question
 the
 Prisoner
 but
 Jesus
 remained
 silent
 The
 chief
 priests
 and
 scribes
 vehemently
 voiced
 their
 accusations
 but
 not
 a
 word
 was
 uttered
 by
 the
 Lord
 Herod
 is
 the
 only
 character
 in
 history
 to
 whom
 Jesus
 is
 known
 to
 have
 applied
 a
 personal
 epithet
 of
 contempt
 Go
 ye
 and
 tell
 that
 fox
 He
 once
 said
 to
 certain
 Pharisees
 who
 had
 come
 to
 Him
 with
 the
 story
 that
 Herod
 intended
 to
 kill
 Him
 As
 far
 as
 we
 know
 Herod
 is
 further
 distinguished
 as
 the
 only
 being
 who
 saw
 Christ
 face
 to
 face
 and
 spoke
 to
 Him
 yet
 never
 heard
 His
 voice
 For
 penitent
 sinners
 weeping
 women
 prattling
 children
 for
 the
 scribes
 the
 Pharisees
 the
 Sadducees
 the
 rabbis
 for
 the
 perjured
 high
 priest
 and
 his
 obsequious
 and
 insolent
 underling
 and
 for
 Pilate
 the
 pagan
 Christ
 had
 wordsof

 or

 or

 the

 He
 had
 but
 disdainful
 and
 kingly
 silence
 Thoroughly
 piqued
 Herod
 turned
 from
 insulting
 questions
 to
 acts
 of
 malignant
 derision
 He
 and
 his
 menatarms
 made
 sport
 of
 the
 suffering
 Christ
 set
 him
 at
 nought
 and
 mocked
 him
 then
 in
 travesty
 they
 arrayed
 him
 in
 a
 gorgeous
 robe
 and
 sent
 him
 again
 to
 Pilate
 Herod
 had
 found
 nothing
 in
 Jesus
 to
 warrant
 condemnation
 CHRIST
 AGAIN
 BEFORE
 PILATE
 The
 Roman
 procurator
 finding
 that
 he
 could
 not
 evade
 further
 consideration
 of
 the
 case
 called
 together
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 the
 rulers
 and
 the
 people
 and
 said
 unto
 them
 Ye
 have
 brought
 this
 man
 unto
 me
 as
 one
 that
 perverteth
 the
 people
 and
 behold
 I
 having
 examined
 him
 before
 you
 have
 found
 no
 fault
 in
 this
 man
 touching
 those
 things
 whereof
 ye
 accuse
 him
 No
 nor
 yet
 Herod
 for
 I
 sent
 you
 to
 him
 and
 lo
 nothing
 worthy
 of
 death
 is
 done
 unto
 him
 I
 will
 therefore
 chastise
 him
 and
 release
 him
 Pilates
 desire
 to
 save
 Jesus
 from
 death
 was
 just
 and
 genuine
 his
 intention
 of
 scourging
 the
 Prisoner
 whose
 innocence
 he
 had
 affirmed
 and
 reaffirmed
 was
 an
 infamous
 concession
 to
 Jewish
 prejudice
 He
 knew
 that
 the
 charge
 of
 sedition
 and
 treason
 was
 without
 foundation
 and
 that
 even
 the
 framing
 of
 such
 an
 accusation
 by
 the
 Jewish
 hierarchy
 whose
 simulated
 loyalty
 to
 Csar
 was
 but
 a
 cloak
 for
 inherent
 and
 undying
 hatred
 was
 ridiculous
 in
 the
 extreme
 and
 he
 fully
 realized
 that
 the
 priestly
 rulers
 had
 delivered
 Jesus
 into
 his
 hands
 because
 of
 envy
 and
 malice
 It
 was
 the
 custom
 for
 the
 governor
 at
 the
 Passover
 season
 to
 pardon
 and
 release
 any
 one
 condemned
 prisoner
 whom
 the
 people
 might
 name
 On
 that
 day
 there
 lay
 in
 durance
 awaiting
 execution
 a
 notable
 prisoner
 called
 Barabbas
 who
 had
 been
 found
 guilty
 of
 sedition
 in
 that
 he
 had
 incited
 the
 people
 to
 insurrection
 and
 had
 committed
 murder
 This
 man
 stood
 convicted
 of
 the
 very
 charge
 on
 which
 Pilate
 specifically
 and
 Herod
 by
 implication
 had
 pronounced
 Jesus
 innocent
 and
 Barabbas
 was
 a
 murderer
 in
 addition
 Pilate
 thought
 to
 pacify
 the
 priests
 and
 people
 by
 releasing
 Jesus
 as
 the
 subject
 of
 Passover
 leniency
 this
 would
 be
 a
 tacit
 recognition
 of
 Christs
 conviction
 before
 the
 ecclesiastical
 court
 and
 practically
 an
 endorsement
 of
 the
 death
 sentence
 superseded
 by
 official
 pardon
 Therefore
 he
 asked
 of
 them
 Whom
 will
 ye
 that
 I
 release
 unto
 you
 Barabbas
 or
 Jesus
 which
 is
 called
 Christ
 There
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 a
 brief
 interval
 between
 Pilates
 question
 and
 the
 peoples
 answer
 during
 which
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 elders
 busied
 themselves
 amongst
 the
 multitude
 urging
 them
 to
 demand
 the
 release
 of
 the
 insurrectionist
 and
 murderer
 So
 when
 Pilate
 reiterated
 the
 question
 Whether
 of
 the
 twain
 will
 ye
 that
 I
 release
 unto
 you
 assembled
 Israel
 cried
 Barabbas
 Pilate
 surprized
 disappointed
 and
 angered
 then
 asked
 What
 shall
 I
 do
 then
 with
 Jesus
 which
 is
 called
 Christ
 They
 all
 say
 unto
 him
 Let
 him
 be
 crucified
 And
 the
 governor
 said
 Why
 what
 evil
 hath
 he
 done
 But
 they
 cried
 out
 the
 more
 saying
 Let
 him
 be
 crucified
 The
 Roman
 governor
 was
 sorely
 troubled
 and
 inwardly
 afraid
 To
 add
 to
 his
 perplexity
 he
 received
 a
 warning
 message
 from
 his
 wife
 even
 as
 he
 sat
 on
 the
 judgment
 seat
 Have
 thou
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 that
 just
 man
 for
 I
 have
 suffered
 many
 things
 this
 day
 in
 a
 dream
 because
 of
 him
 Those
 who
 know
 not
 God
 are
 characteristically
 superstitious
 Pilate
 feared
 to
 think
 what
 dread
 portent
 his
 wifes
 dream
 might
 presage
 But
 finding
 that
 he
 could
 not
 prevail
 and
 foreseeing
 a
 tumult
 among
 the
 people
 if
 he
 persisted
 in
 the
 defense
 of
 Christ
 he
 called
 for
 water
 and
 washed
 his
 hands
 before
 the
 multitudea
 symbolic
 act
 of
 disclaiming
 responsibility
 which
 they
 all
 understoodproclaiming
 the
 while
 I
 am
 innocent
 of
 the
 blood
 of
 this
 just
 person
 see
 ye
 to
 it
 Then
 rose
 that
 awful
 selfcondemnatory
 cry
 of
 the
 covenant
 people
 His
 blood
 be
 on
 us
 and
 on
 our
 children
 History
 bears
 an
 appalling
 testimony
 to
 the
 literal
 fulfilment
 of
 that
 dread
 invocation
 Pilate
 released
 Barabbas
 and
 gave
 Jesus
 into
 the
 custody
 of
 the
 soldiers
 to
 be
 scourged
 Scourging
 was
 a
 frightful
 preliminary
 to
 death
 on
 the
 cross
 The
 instrument
 of
 punishment
 was
 a
 whip
 of
 many
 thongs
 loaded
 with
 metal
 and
 edged
 with
 jagged
 pieces
 of
 bone
 Instances
 are
 of
 record
 in
 which
 the
 condemned
 died
 under
 the
 lash
 and
 so
 escaped
 the
 horrors
 of
 living
 crucifixion
 In
 accordance
 with
 the
 brutal
 customs
 of
 the
 time
 Jesus
 weak
 and
 bleeding
 from
 the
 fearful
 scourging
 He
 had
 undergone
 was
 given
 over
 to
 the
 halfsavage
 soldiers
 for
 their
 amusement
 He
 was
 no
 ordinary
 victim
 so
 the
 whole
 band
 came
 together
 in
 the
 Pretorium
 or
 great
 hall
 of
 the
 palace
 to
 take
 part
 in
 the
 diabolical
 sport
 They
 stripped
 Jesus
 of
 His
 outer
 raiment
 and
 placed
 upon
 Him
 a
 purple
 robe
 Then
 with
 a
 sense
 of
 fiendish
 realism
 they
 platted
 a
 crown
 of
 thorns
 and
 placed
 it
 about
 the
 Sufferers
 brows
 a
 reed
 was
 put
 into
 His
 right
 hand
 as
 a
 royal
 scepter
 and
 as
 they
 bowed
 in
 a
 mockery
 of
 homage
 they
 saluted
 Him
 with
 Hail
 King
 of
 the
 Jews
 Snatching
 away
 the
 reed
 or
 rod
 they
 brutally
 smote
 Him
 with
 it
 upon
 the
 head
 driving
 the
 cruel
 thorns
 into
 His
 quivering
 flesh
 they
 slapped
 Him
 with
 their
 hands
 and
 spat
 upon
 Him
 in
 vile
 and
 vicious
 abandonment
 Pilate
 had
 probably
 been
 a
 silent
 observer
 of
 this
 barbarous
 scene
 He
 stopped
 it
 and
 determined
 to
 make
 another
 attempt
 to
 touch
 the
 springs
 of
 Jewish
 pity
 if
 such
 existed
 He
 went
 outside
 and
 to
 the
 multitude
 said
 Behold
 I
 bring
 him
 forth
 to
 you
 that
 ye
 may
 know
 that
 I
 find
 no
 fault
 in
 him
 This
 was
 the
 governors
 third
 definite
 proclamation
 of
 the
 Prisoners
 innocence
 Then
 came
 Jesus
 forth
 wearing
 the
 crown
 of
 thorns
 and
 the
 purple
 robe
 And
 Pilate
 saith
 unto
 them
 Behold
 the
 man
 Pilate
 seems
 to
 have
 counted
 on
 the
 pitiful
 sight
 of
 the
 scourged
 and
 bleeding
 Christ
 to
 soften
 the
 hearts
 of
 the
 maddened
 Jews
 But
 the
 effect
 failed
 Think
 of
 the
 awful
 facta
 heathen
 a
 pagan
 who
 knew
 not
 God
 pleading
 with
 the
 priests
 and
 people
 of
 Israel
 for
 the
 life
 of
 their
 Lord
 and
 King
 When
 unmoved
 by
 the
 sight
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 officers
 cried
 with
 increasing
 vindictiveness
 crucify
 him
 crucify
 him
 Pilate
 pronounced
 the
 fatal
 sentence
 Take
 ye
 him
 and
 crucify
 him
 but
 added
 with
 bitter
 emphasis
 I
 find
 no
 fault
 in
 him
 It
 will
 be
 remembered
 that
 the
 only
 charge
 preferred
 against
 Christ
 before
 the
 Roman
 governor
 was
 that
 of
 sedition
 the
 Jewish
 persecutors
 had
 carefully
 avoided
 even
 the
 mention
 of
 blasphemy
 which
 was
 the
 offense
 for
 which
 they
 had
 adjudged
 Jesus
 worthy
 of
 death
 Now
 that
 sentence
 of
 crucifixion
 had
 been
 extorted
 from
 Pilate
 they
 brazenly
 attempted
 to
 make
 it
 appear
 that
 the
 governors
 mandate
 was
 but
 a
 ratification
 of
 their
 own
 decree
 of
 death
 therefore
 they
 said
 We
 have
 a
 law
 and
 by
 our
 law
 he
 ought
 to
 die
 because
 he
 made
 himself
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 What
 did
 it
 mean
 That
 aweinspiring
 title
 Son
 of
 God
 struck
 yet
 deeper
 into
 Pilates
 troubled
 conscience
 Once
 more
 he
 took
 Jesus
 into
 the
 judgment
 hall
 and
 in
 trepidation
 asked
 Whence
 art
 thou
 The
 inquiry
 was
 as
 to
 whether
 Jesus
 was
 human
 or
 superhuman
 A
 direct
 avowal
 of
 the
 Lords
 divinity
 would
 have
 frightened
 but
 could
 not
 have
 enlightened
 the
 heathen
 ruler
 therefore
 Jesus
 gave
 no
 answer
 Pilate
 was
 further
 surprized
 and
 perhaps
 somewhat
 offended
 at
 this
 seeming
 disregard
 of
 his
 authority
 He
 demanded
 an
 explanation
 saying
 Speakest
 thou
 not
 unto
 me
 knowest
 thou
 not
 that
 I
 have
 power
 to
 crucify
 thee
 and
 have
 power
 to
 release
 thee
 Then
 Jesus
 replied
 Thou
 couldest
 have
 no
 power
 at
 all
 against
 me
 except
 it
 were
 given
 thee
 from
 above
 therefore
 he
 that
 delivered
 me
 unto
 thee
 hath
 the
 greater
 sin
 The
 positions
 were
 reversed
 Christ
 was
 the
 Judge
 and
 Pilate
 the
 subject
 of
 His
 decision
 Though
 not
 found
 guiltless
 the
 Roman
 was
 pronounced
 less
 culpable
 than
 he
 or
 those
 who
 had
 forced
 Jesus
 into
 his
 power
 and
 who
 had
 demanded
 of
 him
 an
 unrighteous
 committal
 The
 governor
 though
 having
 pronounced
 sentence
 yet
 sought
 means
 of
 releasing
 the
 submissive
 Sufferer
 His
 first
 evidence
 of
 wavering
 was
 greeted
 by
 the
 Jews
 with
 the
 cry
 If
 thou
 let
 this
 man
 go
 thou
 art
 not
 Csars
 friend
 whosoever
 maketh
 himself
 a
 king
 speaketh
 against
 Csar
 Pilate
 took
 his
 place
 in
 the
 judgment
 seat
 which
 was
 set
 up
 in
 the
 place
 of
 the
 Pavement
 or
 Gabbatha
 outside
 the
 hall
 He
 was
 resentful
 against
 those
 Jews
 who
 had
 dared
 to
 intimate
 that
 he
 was
 no
 friend
 of
 Csar
 and
 whose
 intimation
 might
 lead
 to
 an
 embassy
 of
 complaint
 being
 sent
 to
 Rome
 to
 misrepresent
 him
 in
 exaggerated
 accusation
 Pointing
 to
 Jesus
 he
 exclaimed
 with
 unveiled
 sarcasm
 Behold
 your
 King
 But
 the
 Jews
 answered
 in
 threatening
 and
 ominous
 shouts
 Away
 with
 him
 away
 with
 him
 crucify
 him
 In
 stinging
 reminder
 of
 their
 national
 subjugation
 Pilate
 asked
 with
 yet
 more
 cutting
 irony
 Shall
 I
 crucify
 your
 King
 And
 the
 chief
 priests
 cried
 aloud
 We
 have
 no
 king
 but
 Csar
 Even
 so
 was
 it
 and
 was
 to
 be
 The
 people
 who
 had
 by
 covenant
 accepted
 Jehovah
 as
 their
 King
 now
 rejected
 Him
 in
 Person
 and
 acknowledged
 no
 sovereign
 but
 Csar
 Csars
 subjects
 and
 serfs
 have
 they
 been
 through
 all
 the
 centuries
 since
 Pitiable
 is
 the
 state
 of
 man
 or
 nation
 who
 in
 heart
 and
 spirit
 will
 have
 no
 king
 but
 Csar
 Wherein
 lay
 the
 cause
 of
 Pilates
 weakness
 He
 was
 the
 emperors
 representative
 the
 imperial
 procurator
 with
 power
 to
 crucify
 or
 to
 save
 officially
 he
 was
 an
 autocrat
 His
 conviction
 of
 Christs
 blamelessness
 and
 his
 desire
 to
 save
 Him
 from
 the
 cross
 are
 beyond
 question
 Why
 did
 Pilate
 waver
 hesitate
 vacillate
 and
 at
 length
 yield
 contrary
 to
 his
 conscience
 and
 his
 will
 Because
 after
 all
 he
 was
 more
 slave
 than
 freeman
 He
 was
 in
 servitude
 to
 his
 past
 He
 knew
 that
 should
 complaint
 be
 made
 of
 him
 at
 Rome
 his
 corruption
 and
 cruelties
 his
 extortions
 and
 the
 unjustifiable
 slaughter
 he
 had
 caused
 would
 all
 be
 brought
 against
 him
 He
 was
 the
 Roman
 ruler
 but
 the
 people
 over
 whom
 he
 exercized
 official
 dominion
 delighted
 in
 seeing
 him
 cringe
 when
 they
 cracked
 with
 vicious
 snap
 above
 his
 head
 the
 whip
 of
 a
 threatened
 report
 about
 him
 to
 his
 imperial
 master
 Tiberius
 JUDAS
 ISCARIOT
 When
 Judas
 Iscariot
 saw
 how
 terribly
 effective
 had
 been
 the
 outcome
 of
 his
 treachery
 he
 became
 wildly
 remorseful
 During
 Christs
 trial
 before
 the
 Jewish
 authorities
 with
 its
 associated
 humiliation
 and
 cruelty
 the
 traitor
 had
 seen
 the
 seriousness
 of
 his
 action
 and
 when
 the
 unresisting
 Sufferer
 had
 been
 delivered
 up
 to
 the
 Romans
 and
 the
 fatal
 consummation
 had
 become
 a
 certainty
 the
 enormity
 of
 his
 crime
 filled
 Judas
 with
 nameless
 horror
 Rushing
 into
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 elders
 while
 the
 final
 preparations
 for
 the
 crucifixion
 of
 the
 Lord
 were
 in
 progress
 he
 implored
 the
 priestly
 rulers
 to
 take
 back
 the
 accursed
 wage
 they
 had
 paid
 him
 crying
 in
 an
 agony
 of
 despair
 I
 have
 sinned
 in
 that
 I
 have
 betrayed
 the
 innocent
 blood
 He
 may
 have
 vaguely
 expected
 a
 word
 of
 sympathy
 from
 the
 conspirators
 in
 whose
 wickedly
 skilful
 hands
 he
 had
 been
 so
 ready
 and
 serviceable
 a
 tool
 possibly
 he
 hoped
 that
 his
 avowal
 might
 stem
 the
 current
 of
 their
 malignancy
 and
 that
 they
 would
 ask
 for
 a
 reversal
 of
 the
 sentence
 But
 the
 rulers
 in
 Israel
 repulsed
 him
 with
 disgust
 What
 is
 that
 to
 us
 they
 sneered
 see
 thou
 to
 that
 He
 had
 served
 their
 purpose
 they
 had
 paid
 him
 his
 price
 they
 wished
 never
 to
 look
 upon
 his
 face
 again
 and
 pitilessly
 they
 flung
 him
 back
 into
 the
 haunted
 blackness
 of
 his
 maddened
 conscience
 Still
 clutching
 the
 bag
 of
 silver
 the
 all
 too
 real
 remembrancer
 of
 his
 frightful
 sin
 he
 rushed
 into
 the
 temple
 penetrating
 even
 to
 the
 precincts
 of
 priestly
 reservation
 and
 dashed
 the
 silver
 pieces
 upon
 the
 floor
 of
 the
 sanctuary
 Then
 under
 the
 goading
 impulse
 of
 his
 master
 the
 devil
 to
 whom
 he
 had
 become
 a
 bondslave
 body
 and
 soul
 he
 went
 out
 and
 hanged
 himself
 The
 chief
 priests
 gathered
 up
 the
 pieces
 of
 silver
 and
 in
 sacrilegious
 scrupulosity
 held
 a
 solemn
 council
 to
 determine
 what
 they
 should
 do
 with
 the
 price
 of
 blood
 As
 they
 deemed
 it
 unlawful
 to
 add
 the
 attainted
 coin
 to
 the
 sacred
 treasury
 they
 bought
 with
 it
 a
 certain
 clayyard
 once
 the
 property
 of
 a
 potter
 and
 the
 very
 place
 in
 which
 Judas
 had
 made
 of
 himself
 a
 suicide
 this
 tract
 of
 ground
 they
 set
 apart
 as
 a
 burial
 place
 for
 aliens
 strangers
 and
 pagans
 The
 body
 of
 Judas
 the
 betrayer
 of
 the
 Christ
 was
 probably
 the
 first
 to
 be
 there
 interred
 And
 that
 field
 was
 called
 Aceldama
 that
 is
 to
 say
 The
 field
 of
 blood
 NOTES
 TO
 CHAPTER
 
 
 Annas
 and
 His
 Interview
 with
 JesusNo
 figure
 is
 better
 known
 in
 contemporary
 Jewish
 history
 than
 that
 of
 Annas
 no
 person
 deemed
 more
 fortunate
 or
 successful
 but
 also
 none
 more
 generally
 execrated
 than
 the
 late
 high
 priest
 He
 had
 held
 the
 pontificate
 for
 only
 six
 or
 seven
 years
 but
 it
 was
 filled
 by
 not
 fewer
 than
 five
 of
 his
 sons
 by
 his
 soninlaw
 Caiaphas
 and
 by
 a
 grandson
 And
 in
 those
 days
 it
 was
 at
 least
 for
 one
 of
 Annas
 disposition
 much
 better
 to
 have
 been
 than
 to
 be
 high
 priest
 He
 enjoyed
 all
 the
 dignity
 of
 the
 office
 and
 all
 its
 influence
 also
 since
 he
 was
 able
 to
 promote
 to
 it
 those
 most
 closely
 connected
 with
 him
 And
 while
 they
 acted
 publicly
 he
 really
 directed
 affairs
 without
 either
 the
 responsibility
 or
 the
 restraints
 which
 the
 office
 imposed
 His
 influence
 with
 the
 Romans
 he
 owed
 to
 the
 religious
 views
 which
 he
 professed
 to
 his
 open
 partisanship
 of
 the
 foreigner
 and
 to
 his
 enormous
 wealth
 We
 have
 seen
 what
 immense
 revenues
 the
 family
 of
 Annas
 must
 have
 derived
 from
 the
 Temple
 booths
 and
 how
 nefarious
 and
 unpopular
 was
 the
 traffic
 The
 names
 of
 those
 bold
 licentious
 unscrupulous
 degenerate
 sons
 of
 Aaron
 were
 spoken
 with
 whispered
 curses
 Without
 referring
 to
 Christs
 interference
 with
 that
 Templetraffic
 which
 if
 His
 authority
 had
 prevailed
 would
 of
 course
 have
 been
 fatal
 to
 it
 we
 can
 understand
 how
 antithetic
 in
 every
 respect
 a
 Messiah
 and
 such
 a
 Messiah
 as
 Jesus
 must
 have
 been
 to
 Annas
 No
 account
 is
 given
 of
 what
 passed
 before
 Annas
 Even
 the
 fact
 of
 Christs
 being
 first
 brought
 to
 him
 is
 only
 mentioned
 in
 the
 fourth
 Gospel
 As
 the
 disciples
 had
 all
 forsaken
 Him
 and
 fled
 we
 can
 understand
 that
 they
 were
 in
 ignorance
 of
 what
 actually
 passed
 till
 they
 had
 again
 rallied
 at
 least
 so
 far
 that
 Peter
 and
 another
 disciple
 evidently
 John
 followed
 Him
 into
 the
 palace
 of
 the
 high
 priestthat
 is
 into
 the
 palace
 of
 Caiaphas
 not
 of
 Annas
 For
 as
 according
 to
 the
 three
 synoptic
 Gospels
 the
 palace
 of
 the
 high
 priest
 Caiaphas
 was
 the
 scene
 of
 Peters
 denial
 the
 account
 of
 it
 in
 the
 fourth
 Gospel
 must
 refer
 to
 the
 same
 locality
 and
 not
 to
 the
 palace

 Christs
 Forbearance
 when
 SmittenThat
 Jesus
 maintained
 His
 equanimity
 and
 submissiveness
 even
 under
 the
 provocation
 of
 a
 blow
 dealt
 by
 a
 brutish
 underling
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 high
 priest
 is
 confirmatory
 of
 our
 Lords
 affirmation
 that
 He
 had
 overcome
 the
 world
 John
 
 One
 cannot
 read
 the
 passage
 without
 comparing
 perhaps
 involuntarily
 the
 divine
 submissiveness
 of
 Jesus
 on
 this
 occasion
 with
 the
 wholly
 natural
 and
 human
 indignation
 of
 Paul
 under
 somewhat
 similar
 conditions
 at
 a
 later
 time
 Acts
 
 The
 high
 priest
 Ananias
 displeased
 at
 Pauls
 remarks
 ordered
 someone
 who
 stood
 by
 to
 smite
 him
 on
 the
 mouth
 Paul
 broke
 forth
 in
 angry
 protest
 God
 shall
 smite
 thee
 thou
 whited
 wall
 for
 sittest
 thou
 to
 judge
 me
 after
 the
 law
 and
 commandest
 me
 to
 be
 smitten
 contrary
 to
 the
 law
 Afterward

 High
 Priests
 and
 EldersThese
 titles
 as
 held
 by
 officials
 of
 the
 Jewish
 hierarchy
 in
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 must
 not
 be
 confused
 with
 the
 same
 designations
 as
 applied
 to
 holders
 of
 the
 Higher
 or
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 The
 high
 priest
 of
 the
 Jews
 was
 the
 presiding
 priest
 he
 had
 to
 be
 of
 Aaronic
 descent
 to
 be
 a
 priest
 at
 all
 he
 became
 high
 priest
 by
 Roman
 appointment
 The
 elders
 as
 the
 name
 indicates
 were
 men
 of
 mature
 years
 and
 experience
 who
 were
 appointed
 to
 act
 as
 magistrates
 in
 the
 towns
 and
 as
 judges
 in
 the
 ecclesiastical
 tribunals
 either
 in
 the
 Lesser
 Sanhedrins
 of
 the
 provinces
 or
 in
 the
 Great
 Sanhedrin
 at
 Jerusalem
 The
 term
 elder
 as
 commonly
 used
 among
 the
 Jews
 in
 the
 days
 of
 Jesus
 had
 no
 closer
 relation
 to
 eldership
 in
 the
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 than
 had
 the
 title
 scribe
 The
 duties
 of
 Jewish
 high
 priests
 and
 elders
 combined
 both
 ecclesiastical
 and
 secular
 functions
 indeed
 both
 offices
 had
 come
 to
 be
 in
 large
 measure
 political
 perquisites

 From
 the
 departure
 of
 Moses
 to
 the
 coming
 of
 Christ
 the
 organized
 theocracy
 of
 Israel
 was
 that
 of
 the
 Lesser

 Aaronic
 Priesthood
 comprizing
 the
 office
 of
 priest
 which
 was
 confined
 to

 contends
 that
 the
 night
 arraignment
 of
 Jesus
 in
 the
 house
 of
 Caiaphas
 was
 not
 a
 trial
 before
 the
 Sanhedrin
 and
 notes
 the
 irregularities
 and
 illegalities
 of
 the
 procedure
 as
 proof
 that
 the
 Sanhedrin
 could
 not
 have
 done
 what
 was
 done
 that
 night
 With
 ample
 citations
 in
 corroboration
 of
 the
 legal
 requirements
 specified
 the
 author
 says
 But
 besides
 the
 trial
 and
 sentence
 of
 Jesus
 in
 the
 palace
 of
 Caiaphas
 would
 have
 outraged
 every
 principle
 of
 Jewish
 criminal
 law
 and
 procedure
 Such
 causes
 could
 only
 be
 tried
 and
 capital
 sentence
 pronounced
 in
 the
 regular
 meetingplace
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 not
 as
 here
 in
 the
 high
 priests
 palace
 no
 process
 least
 of
 all
 such
 an
 one
 might
 be
 begun
 in
 the
 night
 nor
 even
 in
 the
 afternoon
 although
 if
 the
 discussion
 had
 gone
 on
 all
 day
 sentence
 might
 be
 pronounced
 at
 night
 Again
 no
 process
 could
 take
 place
 on
 Sabbaths
 or
 feastdays
 or
 even
 on
 the
 eves
 of
 them
 although
 this
 would
 not
 have
 nullified
 proceedings
 and
 it
 might
 be
 argued
 on
 the
 other
 side
 that
 a
 process
 against
 one
 who
 had
 seduced
 the
 people
 should
 preferably
 be
 carried
 on
 and
 sentence
 executed
 on
 public
 feastdays
 for
 the
 warning
 of
 all
 Lastly
 in
 capital
 causes
 there
 was
 a
 very
 elaborate
 system
 of
 warning
 and
 cautioning
 witnesses
 while
 it
 may
 safely
 be
 affirmed
 that
 at
 a
 regular
 trial
 Jewish
 judges
 however
 prejudiced
 would
 not
 have
 acted
 as
 the
 Sanhedrists
 and
 Caiaphas
 did
 on
 this
 occasion
 But
 although
 Christ
 was
 not
 tried
 and
 sentenced
 in
 a
 formal
 meeting
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 there
 can
 alas
 be
 no
 question
 that
 His
 condemnation
 and
 death
 were
 the
 work
 if
 not
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 yet
 of
 the
 Sanhedristsof
 the
 whole
 body
 of
 them
 all
 the
 council
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 expressing
 what
 was
 the
 judgment
 and
 purpose
 of
 all
 the
 supreme
 council
 and
 leaders
 of
 Israel
 with
 only
 very
 few
 exceptions
 We
 bear
 in
 mind
 that
 the
 resolution
 to
 sacrifice
 Christ
 had
 for
 some
 time
 been
 taken
 The
 purpose
 in
 quoting
 the
 foregoing
 is
 to
 show
 on
 acknowledged
 and
 eminent
 authority
 some
 of
 the
 illegalities
 of
 the
 night
 trial
 of
 Jesus
 which
 as
 shown
 by
 the
 above
 and
 by
 the
 scriptural
 record
 was
 conducted
 by
 the
 high
 priest
 and
 the
 council
 or
 Sanhedrin
 in
 admittedly
 irregular
 and
 unlawful
 manner
 If
 the
 Sanhedrists
 tried
 and
 condemned
 yet
 were
 not
 in
 session
 as
 the
 Sanhedrin
 the
 enormity
 of
 the
 proceeding
 is
 if
 possible
 deeper
 and
 blacker
 than
 ever

 The
 Hebrew
 Trial
 the
 record
 of
 fact
 in
 the
 case
 and
 the
 Hebrew
 criminal
 law
 bearing
 thereon
 are
 exhaustively
 considered
 Then
 follows
 an
 elaborate
 Brief
 in
 which
 the
 following
 points
 are
 set
 forth
 in
 order
 Point
 
 The
 Arrest
 of
 Jesus
 was
 illegal
 since
 it
 was
 effected
 by
 night
 and
 through
 the
 treachery
 of
 Judas
 an
 accomplice
 both
 of
 which
 features
 were
 expressly
 forbidden
 in
 the
 Jewish
 law
 of
 that
 day
 Point
 
 The
 private
 examination
 of
 Jesus
 before
 Annas
 or
 Caiaphas
 was
 illegal
 for
 
 it
 was
 made
 by
 night
 
 the
 hearing
 of
 any
 cause
 by
 a
 sole
 judge
 was
 expressly
 forbidden
 
 as
 quoted
 from
 Salvador
 A
 principle
 perpetually
 reproduced
 in
 the
 Hebrew
 scriptures
 relates
 to
 the
 two
 conditions
 of
 publicity
 and
 liberty
 Point
 
 The
 indictment
 against
 Jesus
 was
 in
 form
 illegal
 The
 entire
 criminal
 procedure
 of
 the
 Mosaic
 code
 rests
 upon
 four
 rules
 certainty
 in
 the
 indictment
 publicity
 in
 the
 discussion
 full
 freedom
 granted
 to
 the
 accused
 and
 assurance
 against
 all
 dangers
 or
 errors
 of
 testimonySalvador

 The
 Sanhedrin
 did
 not
 and
 could
 not
 originate
 charges
 it
 only
 investigated
 those
 brought
 before
 itEdersheim
 vol
 I
 p
 
 The
 evidence
 of
 the
 leading
 witnesses
 constituted
 the
 charge
 There
 was
 no
 other
 charge
 no
 more
 formal
 indictment
 Until
 they
 spoke
 and
 spoke
 in
 the
 public
 assembly
 the
 prisoner
 was
 scarcely
 an
 accused
 manInnes
 p
 
 The
 only
 prosecutors
 known
 to
 Talmudic
 criminal
 jurisprudence
 are
 the
 witnesses
 to
 the
 crime
 Their
 duty
 is
 to
 bring
 the
 matter
 to
 the
 cognizance
 of
 the
 court
 and
 to
 bear
 witness
 against
 the
 criminal
 In
 capital
 cases
 they
 are
 the
 legal
 executioners

 official
 accuser
 or
 prosecutor

 Mendelsohn
 p
 
 Point
 
 The
 proceedings
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 against
 Jesus
 were
 illegal
 because
 they
 were
 conducted
 at
 night

 p
 
 Point
 
 The
 proceedings
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 against

 were
 illegal
 because

 convened
 before
 the

 Since

 Point
 
 The
 proceedings
 against
 Jesus
 were
 illegal
 because
 they
 were
 conducted
 on
 the
 day
 preceding
 a
 Jewish
 Sabbath
 also
 on
 the
 first
 day
 of
 unleavened
 bread
 and
 the
 eve
 of
 the
 Passover
 They
 shall
 not

 the
 eve
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 nor
 on
 that
 of
 any
 festivalMishna

 No
 court
 of
 justice
 in
 Israel
 was
 permitted
 to
 hold
 sessions
 on
 the
 Sabbath
 or
 any
 of
 the
 seven
 Biblical
 holidays
 In
 cases
 of
 capital
 crime
 no
 trial
 could
 be
 commenced
 on
 Friday
 or
 the
 day
 previous
 to
 any
 holiday
 because
 it
 was

 than

 to
 continue
 them

 Wise
 Martyrdom

 p
 
 Point
 
 The
 trial
 of
 Jesus
 was
 illegal
 because
 it
 was
 concluded
 within
 one
 day
 A
 criminal
 case
 resulting
 in
 the
 acquittal
 of
 the
 accused
 may
 terminate
 the
 same
 day
 on
 which
 the
 trial
 began
 But
 if
 a
 sentence
 of
 death
 is
 to
 be
 pronounced
 it
 cannot
 be
 concluded
 before
 the
 following
 dayMishna
 San
 
 Point
 
 The
 sentence
 of
 condemnation
 pronounced
 against
 Jesus
 by
 the
 Sanhedrin
 was
 illegal
 because
 it
 was
 founded
 upon
 His
 uncorroborated
 confession
 We
 have
 it
 as
 a
 fundamental
 principle
 of
 our
 jurisprudence
 that
 no
 one
 can
 bring
 an
 accusation
 against
 himself
 Should
 a
 man
 make
 confession
 of
 guilt
 before
 a
 legally
 constituted
 tribunal
 such
 confession
 is
 not
 to
 be
 used
 against
 him
 unless
 properly
 attested
 by
 two
 other
 witnessesMaimonides
 
 Not
 only
 is
 selfcondemnation
 never
 extorted
 from
 the
 defendant
 by
 means
 of
 torture
 but
 no
 attempt
 is
 ever
 made
 to
 lead
 him
 on
 to
 selfincrimination
 Moreover
 a
 voluntary
 confession
 on
 his
 part
 is
 not
 admitted
 in
 evidence
 and
 therefore
 not
 competent
 to
 convict
 him
 unless
 a
 legal
 number
 of
 witnesses
 minutely
 corroborate
 his
 selfaccusationMendelsohn
 p
 
 Point
 
 The
 condemnation
 of
 Jesus
 was
 illegal
 because
 the
 verdict
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 was
 unanimous
 A
 simultaneous
 and
 unanimous
 verdict
 of
 guilt
 rendered
 on
 the
 day
 of
 the
 trial
 has
 the
 effect
 of
 an
 acquittalMendelsohn
 p
 
 If
 none
 of
 the
 judges
 defend
 the
 culprit
 ie
 all
 pronounce
 him
 guilty
 having

 The
 Mishna
 tells
 us
 that
 after

 solemn
 washing

 their
 disclaimer
 of

 priests
 responded
 with
 this
 prayer
 Forgive

 The
 Underlying
 Cause
 of
 Pilates
 Surrender
 to
 the
 Jewish
 DemandsPilate
 knew
 what
 was
 right
 but
 lacked
 the
 moral
 courage
 to
 do
 it
 He
 was
 afraid
 of
 the
 Jews
 and
 more
 afraid
 of
 hostile
 influence
 at
 Rome
 He
 was
 afraid
 of
 his
 conscience
 but
 more
 afraid
 of
 losing
 his
 official
 position
 It
 was
 the
 policy
 of
 Rome
 to
 be
 gracious
 and
 conciliatory
 in
 dealing
 with
 the
 religions
 and
 social
 customs
 of
 conquered
 nations
 Pontius
 Pilate
 had
 violated
 this
 liberal
 policy
 from
 the
 early
 days
 of
 his
 procuratorship
 In
 utter
 disregard
 of
 the
 Hebrew
 antipathy
 against
 images
 and
 heathen
 insignia
 he
 had
 the
 legionaries
 enter
 Jerusalem
 at
 night
 carrying
 their
 eagles
 and
 standards
 decorated
 with
 the
 effigy
 of
 the
 emperor
 To
 the
 Jews
 this
 act
 was
 a
 defilement
 of
 the
 Holy
 City
 In
 vast
 multitudes
 they
 gathered
 at
 Csarea
 and
 petitioned
 the
 procurator
 that
 the
 standards
 and
 other
 images
 be
 removed
 from
 Jerusalem
 For
 five
 days
 the
 people
 demanded
 and
 Pilate
 refused
 He
 threatened
 a
 general
 slaughter
 and
 was
 amazed
 to
 see
 the
 people
 offer
 themselves
 as
 victims
 of
 the
 sword
 rather
 than
 relinquish
 their
 demands
 Pilate
 had
 to
 yield
 Josephus
 Ant

 also

 Again
 he
 gave
 offense
 in
 forcibly
 appropriating
 the
 Corban
 or
 sacred
 funds
 of
 the
 temple
 to
 the
 construction
 of
 an
 aqueduct
 for
 supplying
 Jerusalem
 with
 water
 from
 the
 pools
 of
 Solomon
 Anticipating
 the
 public
 protest
 of
 the
 people
 he
 had
 caused
 Roman
 soldiers
 to
 disguise
 themselves
 as
 Jews
 and
 with
 weapons
 concealed
 to
 mingle
 with
 the
 crowds
 At
 a
 given
 signal
 these
 assassins
 plied
 their
 weapons
 and
 great
 numbers
 of
 defenceless
 Jews
 were
 killed
 or
 wounded

 On
 another
 occasion
 Pilate
 had
 grossly
 offended
 the
 people
 by
 setting
 up
 in
 his
 official
 residence
 at
 Jerusalem
 shields
 that
 had
 been
 dedicated
 to
 Tiberius
 and
 this
 less
 for
 the
 honor
 of

 for
 the
 annoyance

 Judas
 IscariotToday
 we
 speak
 of
 a
 traitor
 as
 a
 Judas
 or
 an
 Iscariot
 The
 man
 who
 made
 the
 combined
 name
 infamous
 has
 been
 for
 ages
 a
 subject
 of
 discussion
 among
 theologians
 and
 philosophers
 and
 in
 later
 times
 the
 light
 of
 psychological
 analysis
 has
 been
 turned
 upon
 him
 German
 philosophers
 were
 among
 the
 earliest
 to
 assert
 that
 the
 man
 had
 been
 judged
 in
 unrighteousness
 and
 that
 his
 real
 character
 was
 of
 brighter
 tint
 than
 that
 in
 which
 it
 had
 been
 painted
 Indeed
 some
 critics
 hold
 that
 of
 all
 the
 Twelve
 Judas
 was
 the
 one
 most
 thoroughly
 convinced
 of
 our
 Lords
 divinity
 in
 the
 flesh
 and
 these
 apologists
 attempt
 to
 explain
 the
 betrayal
 as
 a
 deliberate
 and
 wellintended
 move
 to
 force
 Jesus
 into
 a
 position
 of
 difficulty
 from
 which
 He
 could
 escape
 only
 by
 the
 exercize
 of
 His
 powers
 of
 Godship
 which
 up
 to
 that
 time
 He
 had
 never
 used
 in
 His
 own
 behalf
 We
 are
 not
 the
 invested
 judges
 of
 Judas
 nor
 of
 any
 other
 but
 we
 are
 competent
 to
 frame
 and
 hold
 opinions
 as
 to
 the
 actions
 of
 any
 In
 the
 light
 of
 the
 revealed
 word
 it
 appears
 that
 Judas
 Iscariot
 had
 given
 himself
 up
 to
 the
 cause
 of
 Satan
 while
 ostensibly
 serving
 the
 Christ
 in
 an
 exalted
 capacity
 Such
 a
 surrender
 to
 evil
 powers
 could
 be
 accomplished
 only
 through
 sin
 The
 nature
 and
 extent
 of
 the
 mans
 transgressions
 through
 the
 years
 are
 not
 told
 us
 He
 had
 received
 the
 testimony
 that
 Jesus
 was
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 and
 in
 the
 full
 light
 of
 that
 conviction
 he
 turned
 against
 his
 Lord
 and
 betrayed
 Him
 to
 death
 Modern
 revelation
 is
 no
 less
 explicit
 than
 ancient
 in
 declaring
 that
 the
 path
 of
 sin
 is
 that
 of
 spiritual
 darkness
 leading
 to
 certain
 destruction
 If
 the
 man
 who
 is
 guilty
 of
 adultery
 even
 in
 his
 heart
 only
 shall
 unless
 he
 repents
 surely
 forfeit
 the
 companionship
 of
 the
 Spirit
 of
 God
 and
 shall
 deny
 the
 faith
 and
 so
 the
 voice
 of
 God
 hath
 affirmed
 see
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 we
 cannot
 doubt
 that
 any
 and
 all
 forms
 of
 deadly
 sin
 shall
 poison
 the
 soul
 and
 if
 not
 forsaken
 through
 true
 repentance
 shall
 bring
 that
 soul
 to
 condemnation
 For
 his
 trained
 and
 skilful
 servants
 Satan
 will
 provide
 opportunities
 of
 service
 commensurate
 with
 their
 evil
 ability
 Whatever
 the
 opinion
 of
 modern
 critics
 as
 to
 the
 good
 character
 of
 Judas
 we
 have
 the
 testimony
 of
 John
 who
 for
 nearly
 three
 years
 had
 been
 in
 close
 companionship
 with
 him
 that
 the
 man
 was
 a
 thief
 
 and
 Jesus
 referred
 to
 him
 as
 a
 devil
 
 and
 as
 the
 son
 of
 perdition
 
 See
 in
 this
 connection
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 That
 the
 evil
 proclivities
 of
 Judas
 Iscariot
 were
 known
 to
 Christ
 is
 evidenced
 by
 the
 Lords
 direct
 statement
 that
 among
 the
 Twelve
 was
 one
 who
 was
 a
 devil
 John
 
 compare
 
 Luke
 
 and
 furthermore
 that
 this
 knowledge
 was
 His
 when
 the
 Twelve
 were
 selected
 is
 suggested
 by
 the
 words
 of
 Jesus
 I
 know
 whom
 I
 have
 chosen
 coupled
 with
 the
 explanation
 that
 in
 the
 choice
 He
 had
 made
 would
 the
 scriptures
 be
 fulfilled
 As
 the
 sacrificial
 death
 of
 the
 Lamb
 of
 God
 was
 foreknown
 and
 foretold
 so
 the
 circumstances
 of
 the
 betrayal
 were
 foreseen
 It
 would
 be
 contrary
 to
 both
 the
 letter
 and
 spirit
 of
 the
 revealed
 word
 to
 say
 that
 the
 wretched
 Iscariot
 was
 in
 the
 least
 degree
 deprived
 of
 freedom
 or
 agency
 in
 the
 course
 he
 followed
 to
 so
 execrable
 an
 end
 His
 was
 the
 opportunity
 and
 privilege
 common
 to
 the
 Twelve
 to
 live
 in
 the
 light
 of
 the
 Lords
 immediate
 presence
 and
 to
 receive
 from
 the
 source
 divine
 the
 revelation
 of
 Gods
 purposes
 Judas
 Iscariot
 was
 no
 victim
 of
 circumstances
 no
 insensate
 tool
 guided
 by
 a
 superhuman
 power
 except
 as
 he
 by
 personal
 volition
 gave
 himself
 up
 to
 Satan
 and
 accepted
 a
 wage
 in
 the
 devils
 employ
 Had
 Judas
 been
 true
 to
 the
 right
 other
 means
 than
 his
 perfidy
 would
 have
 operated
 to
 bring
 the
 Lamb
 to
 the
 slaughter
 His
 ordination
 to
 the
 apostleship
 placed
 him
 in
 possession
 of
 opportunity
 and
 privilege
 above
 that
 of
 the
 uncalled
 and
 unordained
 and
 with
 such
 blessed
 possibility
 of
 achievement
 in
 the
 service
 of
 God
 came
 corresponding
 capability
 to
 fall
 A
 trusted
 and
 exalted
 officer
 of
 the
 government
 can
 commit
 acts
 of
 treachery
 and
 treason
 such
 as
 are
 impossible
 to
 the
 citizen
 who
 has
 never
 learned
 the
 secrets
 of
 State
 Advancement
 implies
 increased
 accountability
 even
 more
 literally
 so
 in
 the
 affairs
 of
 Gods
 kingdom
 than
 in
 the
 institutions
 of
 men
 There
 is
 an
 apparent
 discrepancy
 between
 the
 account
 of
 Judas
 Iscariots
 death
 given
 by
 Matthew
 
 and
 that
 in
 Acts
 
 According
 to
 the
 first
 Judas
 hanged
 himself
 the
 second
 states
 that
 he
 fell
 headlong
 and
 all
 his
 bowels
 gushed
 out
 If
 both
 records
 be
 accurate
 the
 wretched
 man
 probably
 hanged
 himself
 and
 afterward
 fell
 possibly
 through
 the
 breaking
 of
 the
 cord
 or
 the
 branch
 to
 which
 it
 was
 attached
 Matthew
 says
 the
 Jewish
 rulers
 purchased
 the
 field
 of
 blood
 the
 writer
 of
 the
 Acts
 quotes
 Peter
 as
 saying
 that
 Judas
 bought
 the
 field
 with
 the
 money
 he
 had
 received
 from
 the
 priests
 As
 the
 ground
 was
 bought
 with
 the
 money
 that
 had
 belonged
 to
 Iscariot
 and
 as
 this
 money
 had
 never
 been
 formally
 taken
 back
 by
 the
 temple
 officials
 the
 field
 bought
 therewith
 belonged
 technically
 to
 the
 estate
 of
 Judas
 The
 variations
 are
 of
 importance
 mainly
 as
 showing
 independence
 of
 authorship
 The
 accounts
 agree
 in
 the
 essential
 feature
 that
 Judas
 died
 a
 miserable
 suicide
 Concerning
 the
 fate
 of
 the
 sons
 of
 perdition
 the
 Lord
 has
 given
 a
 partial
 but
 awful
 account
 through
 a
 revelation
 dated
 February
 
 
 Thus
 saith
 the
 Lord
 concerning
 all
 those
 who
 know
 my
 power
 and
 have
 been
 made
 partakers
 thereof
 and
 suffered
 themselves
 through
 the
 power
 of
 the
 devil
 to
 be
 overcome
 and
 to
 deny
 the
 truth
 and
 defy
 my
 powerThey
 are
 they
 who
 are
 the
 sons
 of
 perdition
 of
 whom
 I
 say
 that
 it
 had
 been
 better
 for
 them
 never
 to
 have
 been
 born
 For
 they
 are
 vessels
 of
 wrath
 doomed
 to
 suffer
 the
 wrath
 of
 God
 with
 the
 devil
 and
 his
 angels
 in
 eternity
 Concerning
 whom
 I
 have
 said
 there
 is
 no
 forgiveness
 in
 this
 world
 nor
 in
 the
 world
 to
 come
 Having
 denied
 the
 Holy
 Spirit
 after
 having
 received
 it
 and
 having
 denied
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 Son
 of
 the
 Fatherhaving
 crucified
 him
 unto
 themselves
 and
 put
 him
 to
 an
 open
 shame
 These
 are
 they
 who
 shall
 go
 away
 into
 the
 lake
 of
 fire
 and
 brimstone
 with
 the
 devil
 and
 his
 angels
 And
 the
 only
 ones
 on
 whom
 the
 second
 death
 shall
 have
 any
 power
 Wherefore
 he
 saves
 all
 except
 them
 they
 shall
 go
 away
 into
 everlasting
 punishment
 which
 is
 endless
 punishment
 which
 is
 eternal
 punishment
 to
 reign
 with
 the
 devil
 and
 his
 angels
 in
 eternity
 where
 their
 worm
 dieth
 not
 and
 the
 fire
 is
 not
 quenched
 which
 is
 their
 torment
 And
 the
 end
 thereof
 neither
 the
 place
 thereof
 nor
 their
 torment
 no
 man
 knows
 Neither
 was
 it
 revealed
 neither
 is
 neither
 will
 be
 revealed
 unto
 man
 except
 to
 them
 who
 are
 made
 partakers
 thereof
 Nevertheless
 I
 the
 Lord
 show
 it
 by
 vision
 unto
 many
 but
 straightway
 shut
 it
 up
 again
 Wherefore
 the
 end
 the
 width
 the
 height
 the
 depth
 and
 the
 misery
 thereof
 they
 understand
 not
 neither
 any
 man
 except
 them
 who
 are
 ordained
 unto
 this
 condemnation

 CHAPTER
 
 DEATH
 AND
 BURIAL
 ON
 THE
 WAY
 TO
 CALVARY
 Pontius
 Pilate
 having
 reluctantly
 surrendered
 to
 the
 clamorous
 demands
 of
 the
 Jews
 issued
 the
 fatal
 order
 and
 Jesus
 divested
 of
 the
 purple
 robe
 and
 arrayed
 in
 His
 own
 apparel
 was
 led
 away
 to
 be
 crucified
 A
 body
 of
 Roman
 soldiers
 had
 the
 condemned
 Christ
 in
 charge
 and
 as
 the
 procession
 moved
 out
 from
 the
 governors
 palace
 a
 motley
 crowd
 comprizing
 priestly
 officials
 rulers
 of
 the
 Jews
 and
 people
 of
 many
 nationalities
 followed
 Two
 convicted
 criminals
 who
 had
 been
 sentenced
 to
 the
 cross
 for
 robbery
 were
 led
 forth
 to
 death
 at
 the
 same
 time
 there
 was
 to
 be
 a
 triple
 execution
 and
 the
 prospective
 scene
 of
 horror
 attracted
 the
 morbidly
 minded
 such
 as
 delight
 to
 gloat
 over
 the
 sufferings
 of
 their
 fellows
 In
 the
 crowd
 however
 were
 some
 genuine
 mourners
 as
 shall
 be
 shown
 It
 was
 the
 Roman
 custom
 to
 make
 the
 execution
 of
 convicts
 as
 public
 as
 possible
 under
 the
 mistaken
 and
 antipsychological
 assumption
 that
 the
 spectacle
 of
 dreadful
 punishment
 would
 be
 of
 deterrent
 effect
 This
 misconception
 of
 human
 nature
 has
 not
 yet
 become
 entirely
 obsolete
 The
 sentence
 of
 death
 by
 crucifixion
 required
 that
 the
 condemned
 person
 carry
 the
 cross
 upon
 which
 he
 was
 to
 suffer
 Jesus
 started
 on
 the
 way
 bearing
 His
 cross
 The
 terrible
 strain
 of
 the
 preceding
 hours
 the
 agony
 in
 Gethsemane
 the
 barbarous
 treatment
 He
 had
 suffered
 in
 the
 palace
 of
 the
 high
 priest
 the
 humiliation
 and
 cruel
 usage
 to
 which
 He
 had
 been
 subjected
 before
 Herod
 the
 frightful
 scourging
 under
 Pilates
 order
 the
 brutal
 treatment
 by
 the
 inhuman
 soldiery
 together
 with
 the
 extreme
 humiliation
 and
 the
 mental
 agony
 of
 it
 all
 had
 so
 weakened
 His
 physical
 organism
 that
 He
 moved
 but
 slowly
 under
 the
 burden
 of
 the
 cross
 The
 soldiers
 impatient
 at
 the
 delay
 peremptorily
 impressed
 into
 service
 a
 man
 whom
 they
 met
 coming
 into
 Jerusalem
 from
 the
 country
 and
 him
 they
 compelled
 to
 carry
 the
 cross
 of
 Jesus
 No
 Roman
 or
 Jew
 would
 have
 voluntarily
 incurred
 the
 ignominy
 of
 bearing
 such
 a
 gruesome
 burden
 for
 every
 detail
 connected
 with
 the
 carrying
 out
 of
 a
 sentence
 of
 crucifixion
 was
 regarded
 as
 degrading
 The
 man
 so
 forced
 to
 walk
 in
 the
 footsteps
 of
 Jesus
 bearing
 the
 cross
 upon
 which
 the
 Savior
 of
 the
 world
 was
 to
 consummate
 His
 glorious
 mission
 was
 Simon
 a
 native
 of
 Cyrene
 From
 Marks
 statement
 that
 Simon
 was
 the
 father
 of
 Alexander
 and
 Rufus
 we
 infer
 that
 the
 two
 sons
 were
 known
 to
 the
 evangelists
 readers
 as
 members
 of
 the
 early
 Church
 and
 there
 is
 some
 indication
 that
 the
 household
 of
 Simon
 the
 Cyrenian
 came
 to
 be
 numbered
 with
 the
 believers
 Among
 those
 who
 followed
 or
 stood
 and
 watched
 the
 deathprocession
 pass
 were
 some
 women
 particularly
 who
 bewailed
 and
 lamented
 the
 fate
 to
 which
 Jesus
 was
 going
 We
 read
 of
 no
 man
 who
 ventured
 to
 raise
 his
 voice
 in
 protest
 or
 pity
 but
 on
 this
 dreadful
 occasion
 as
 at
 other
 times
 women
 were
 not
 afraid
 to
 cry
 out
 in
 commiseration
 or
 praise
 Jesus
 who
 had
 been
 silent
 under
 the
 inquisition
 of
 the
 priests
 silent
 under
 the
 humiliating
 mockery
 of
 the
 sensual
 Herod
 and
 his
 coarse
 underlings
 silent
 when
 buffeted
 and
 beaten
 by
 the
 brutal
 legionaries
 of
 Pilate
 turned
 to
 the
 women
 whose
 sympathizing
 lamentations
 had
 reached
 His
 ears
 and
 uttered
 these
 pathetic
 and
 portentous
 words
 of
 admonition
 and
 warning
 Daughters
 of
 Jerusalem
 weep
 not
 for
 me
 but
 weep
 for
 yourselves
 and
 for
 your
 children
 For
 behold
 the
 days
 are
 coming
 in
 the
 which
 they
 shall
 say
 Blessed
 are
 the
 barren
 and
 the
 wombs
 that
 never
 bare
 and
 the
 paps
 which
 never
 gave
 suck
 Then
 shall
 they
 begin
 to
 say
 to
 the
 mountains
 Fall
 on
 us
 and
 to
 the
 hills
 Cover
 us
 For
 if
 they
 do
 these
 things
 in
 a
 green
 tree
 what
 shall
 be
 done
 in
 the
 dry
 It
 was
 the
 Lords
 last
 testimony
 of
 the
 impending
 holocaust
 of
 destruction
 that
 was
 to
 follow
 the
 nations
 rejection
 of
 her
 King
 Although
 motherhood
 was
 the
 glory
 of
 every
 Jewish
 womans
 life
 yet
 in
 the
 terrible
 scenes
 which
 many
 of
 those
 there
 weeping
 would
 live
 to
 witness
 barrenness
 would
 be
 accounted
 a
 blessing
 for
 the
 childless
 would
 have
 fewer
 to
 weep
 over
 and
 at
 least
 would
 be
 spared
 the
 horror
 of
 seeing
 their
 offspring
 die
 of
 starvation
 or
 by
 violence
 for
 so
 dreadful
 would
 be
 that
 day
 that
 people
 would
 fain
 welcome
 the
 falling
 of
 the
 mountains
 upon
 them
 to
 end
 their
 sufferings
 If
 Israels
 oppressors
 could
 do
 what
 was
 then
 in
 process
 of
 doing
 to
 the
 Green
 Tree
 who
 bore
 the
 leafage
 of
 freedom
 and
 truth
 and
 offered
 the
 priceless
 fruit
 of
 life
 eternal
 what
 would
 the
 powers
 of
 evil
 not
 do
 to
 the
 withered
 branches
 and
 dried
 trunk
 of
 apostate
 Judaism

 through

 of
 the
 massive
 wall
 and
 thence
 to
 a
 place
 beyond
 but
 yet
 nigh

 The
 destination

 a
 spot
 called
 Golgotha
 or
 Calvary
 meaning

 place
 of
 a

 CRUCIFIXION
 At
 Calvary
 the
 official
 crucifiers
 proceeded
 without
 delay
 to
 carry
 into
 effect
 the
 dread
 sentence
 pronounced
 upon
 Jesus
 and
 upon
 the
 two
 criminals
 Preparatory
 to
 affixing
 the
 condemned
 to
 the
 cross
 it
 was
 the
 custom
 to
 offer
 each
 a
 narcotic
 draught
 of
 sour
 wine
 or
 vinegar
 mingled
 with
 myrrh
 and
 possibly
 containing
 other
 anodyne
 ingredients
 for
 the
 merciful
 purpose
 of
 deadening
 the
 sensibility
 of
 the
 victim
 This
 was
 no
 Roman
 practise
 but
 was
 allowed
 as
 a
 concession
 to
 Jewish
 sentiment
 When
 the
 drugged
 cup
 was
 presented
 to
 Jesus
 He
 put
 it
 to
 His
 lips
 but
 having
 ascertained
 the
 nature
 of
 its
 contents
 refused
 to
 drink
 and
 so
 demonstrated
 His
 determination
 to
 meet
 death
 with
 faculties
 alert
 and
 mind
 unclouded
 Then
 they
 crucified
 Him
 on
 the
 central
 cross
 of
 three
 and
 placed
 one
 of
 the
 condemned
 malefactors
 on
 His
 right
 hand
 the
 other
 on
 His
 left
 Thus
 was
 realized
 Isaiahs
 vision
 of
 the
 Messiah
 numbered
 among
 the
 transgressors
 But
 few
 details
 of
 the
 actual
 crucifixion
 are
 given
 us
 We
 know
 however
 that
 our
 Lord
 was
 nailed
 to
 the
 cross
 by
 spikes
 driven
 through
 the
 hands
 and
 feet
 as
 was
 the
 Roman
 method
 and
 not
 bound
 only
 by
 cords
 as
 was
 the
 custom
 in
 inflicting
 this
 form
 of
 punishment
 among
 some
 other
 nations
 Death
 by
 crucifixion
 was
 at
 once
 the
 most
 lingering
 and
 most
 painful
 of
 all
 forms
 of
 execution
 The
 victim
 lived
 in
 ever
 increasing
 torture
 generally
 for
 many
 hours
 sometimes
 for
 days
 The
 spikes
 so
 cruelly
 driven
 through
 hands
 and
 feet
 penetrated
 and
 crushed
 sensitive
 nerves
 and
 quivering
 tendons
 yet
 inflicted
 no
 mortal
 wound
 The
 welcome
 relief
 of
 death
 came
 through
 the
 exhaustion
 caused
 by
 intense
 and
 unremitting
 pain
 through
 localized
 inflammation
 and
 congestion
 of
 organs
 incident
 to
 the
 strained
 and
 unnatural
 posture
 of
 the
 body
 As
 the
 crucifiers
 proceeded
 with
 their
 awful
 task
 not
 unlikely
 with
 roughness
 and
 taunts
 for
 killing
 was
 their
 trade
 and
 to
 scenes
 of
 anguish
 they
 had
 grown
 callous
 through
 long
 familiarity
 the
 agonized
 Sufferer
 void
 of
 resentment
 but
 full
 of
 pity
 for
 their
 heartlessness
 and
 capacity
 for
 cruelty
 voiced
 the
 first
 of
 the
 seven
 utterances
 delivered
 from
 the
 cross
 In
 the
 spirit
 of
 Godlike
 mercy
 He
 prayed
 Father
 forgive
 them
 for
 they
 know
 not
 what
 they
 do
 Let
 us
 not
 attempt
 to
 fix
 the
 limits
 of
 the
 Lords
 mercy
 that
 it
 would
 be
 extended
 to
 all
 who
 in
 any
 degree
 could
 justly
 come
 under
 the
 blessed
 boon
 thereof
 ought
 to
 be
 a
 sufficing
 fact
 There
 is
 significance
 in
 the
 form
 in
 which
 this
 merciful
 benediction
 was
 expressed
 Had
 the
 Lord
 said
 I
 forgive
 you
 His
 gracious
 pardon
 may
 have
 been
 understood
 to
 be
 but
 a
 remission
 of
 the
 cruel
 offense
 against
 Himself
 as
 One
 tortured
 under
 unrighteous
 condemnation
 but
 the
 invocation
 of
 the
 Fathers
 forgiveness
 was
 a
 plea
 for
 those
 who
 had
 brought
 anguish
 and
 death
 to
 the
 Fathers
 Well
 Beloved
 Son
 the
 Savior
 and
 Redeemer
 of
 the
 world
 Moses
 forgave
 Miriam
 for
 her
 offense
 against
 himself
 as
 her
 brother
 but
 God
 alone
 could
 remit
 the
 penalty
 and
 remove
 the
 leprosy
 that
 had
 come
 upon
 her
 for
 having
 spoken
 against
 Jehovahs
 high
 priest
 It
 appears
 that
 under
 Roman
 rule
 the
 clothes
 worn
 by
 a
 condemned
 person
 at
 the
 time
 of
 execution
 became
 the
 perquisites
 of
 the
 executioners
 The
 four
 soldiers
 in
 charge
 of
 the
 cross
 upon
 which
 the
 Lord
 suffered
 distributed
 parts
 of
 His
 raiment
 among
 themselves
 and
 there
 remained
 His
 coat
 which
 was
 a
 goodly
 garment
 woven
 throughout
 in
 one
 piece
 without
 seam
 To
 rend
 it
 would
 be
 to
 spoil
 so
 the
 soldiers
 cast
 lots
 to
 determine
 who
 should
 have
 it
 and
 in
 this
 circumstance
 the
 Gospelwriters
 saw
 a
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 psalmists
 prevision
 They
 parted
 my
 garments
 among
 them
 and
 upon
 my
 vesture
 did
 they
 cast
 lots
 To
 the
 cross
 above
 the
 head
 of
 Jesus
 was
 affixed
 a
 title
 or
 inscription
 prepared
 by
 order
 of
 Pilate
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 custom
 of
 setting
 forth
 the
 name
 of
 the
 crucified
 and
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 offense
 for
 which
 he
 had
 been
 condemned
 to
 death
 In
 this
 instance
 the
 title
 was
 inscribed
 in
 three
 languages
 Greek
 Latin
 and
 Hebrew
 one
 or
 more
 of
 which
 would
 be
 understood
 by
 every
 observer
 who
 could
 read
 The
 title
 so
 exhibited
 read
 This
 is
 Jesus
 the
 King
 of
 the
 Jews
 or
 in
 the
 more
 extended
 version
 given
 by
 John
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 the
 King
 of
 the
 Jews
 The
 inscription
 was
 read
 by
 many
 for
 Calvary
 was
 close
 to
 the
 public
 thoroughfare
 and
 on
 this
 holiday
 occasion
 the
 passersby
 were
 doubtless
 numerous
 Comment
 was
 aroused
 for
 if
 literally
 construed
 the
 inscription
 was
 an
 official
 declaration
 that
 the
 crucified
 Jesus
 was
 in
 fact
 King
 of
 the
 Jews
 When
 this
 circumstance
 was
 brought
 to
 the
 attention
 of
 the
 chief
 priests
 they
 excitedly
 appealed
 to
 the
 governor
 saying
 Write
 not
 The
 King
 of
 the
 Jews
 but
 that
 he
 said
 I
 am
 King
 of
 the
 Jews
 Pilate
 answered
 What
 I
 have
 written
 I
 have
 written
 Pilates
 action
 in
 so
 wording
 the
 title
 and
 his
 blunt
 refusal
 to
 permit
 an
 alteration
 may
 have
 been
 an
 intended
 rebuff
 to
 the
 Jewish
 officials
 who
 had
 forced
 him
 against
 his
 judgment
 and
 will
 to
 condemn
 Jesus
 possibly
 however
 the
 demeanor
 of
 the
 submissive
 Prisoner
 and
 His
 avowal
 of
 Kingship
 above
 all
 royalty
 of
 earth
 had
 impressed
 the
 mind
 if
 not
 the
 heart
 of
 the
 pagan
 governor
 with
 a
 conviction
 of
 Christs
 unique
 superiority
 and
 of
 His
 inherent
 right
 of
 dominion
 but
 whatever
 the
 purpose
 behind
 the
 writing
 the
 inscription
 stands
 in
 history
 as
 testimony
 of
 a
 heathens
 consideration
 in
 contrast
 with
 Israels
 ruthless
 rejection
 of
 Israels
 King
 The
 soldiers
 whose
 duty
 it
 was
 to
 guard
 the
 crosses
 until
 loitering
 death
 would
 relieve
 the
 crucified
 of
 their
 increasing
 anguish
 jested
 among
 themselves
 and
 derided
 the
 Christ
 pledging
 Him
 in
 their
 cups
 of
 sour
 wine
 in
 tragic
 mockery
 Looking
 at
 the
 title
 affixed
 above
 the
 Sufferers
 head
 they
 bellowed
 forth
 the
 devilinspired
 challenge
 If
 thou
 be
 the
 king
 of
 the
 Jews
 save
 thyself
 The
 morbid
 multitude
 and
 the
 passersby
 railed
 on
 him
 wagging
 their
 heads
 and
 saying
 Ah
 thou
 that
 destroyest
 the
 temple
 and
 buildest
 it
 in
 three
 days
 save
 thyself
 and
 come
 down
 from
 the
 cross
 But
 worst
 of
 all
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 the
 scribes
 the
 elders
 of
 the
 people
 the
 unvenerable
 Sanhedrists
 became
 ringleaders
 of
 the
 inhuman
 mob
 as
 they
 gloatingly
 exulted
 and
 cried
 aloud
 He
 saved
 others
 himself
 he
 cannot
 save
 If
 he
 be
 the
 King
 of
 Israel
 let
 him
 now
 come
 down
 from
 the
 cross
 and
 we
 will
 believe
 him
 He
 trusted
 in
 God
 let
 him
 deliver
 him
 now
 if
 he
 will
 have
 him
 for
 he
 said
 I
 am
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 Though
 uttered
 in
 ribald
 mockery
 the
 declaration
 of
 the
 rulers
 in
 Israel
 stands
 as
 an
 attestation
 that
 Christ
 had
 saved
 others
 and
 as
 an
 intended
 ironical
 but
 a
 literally
 true
 proclamation
 that
 He
 was
 the
 King
 of
 Israel
 The
 two
 malefactors
 each
 hanging
 from
 his
 cross
 joined
 in
 the
 general
 derision
 and
 cast
 the
 same
 in
 his
 teeth
 One
 of
 them
 in
 the
 desperation
 incident
 to
 approaching
 death
 echoed
 the
 taunts
 of
 the
 priests
 and
 people
 If
 thou
 be
 Christ
 save
 thyself
 and
 us
 The
 dominant
 note
 in
 all
 the
 railings
 and
 revilings
 the
 ribaldry
 and
 mockery
 with
 which
 the
 patient
 and
 submissive
 Christ
 was
 assailed
 while
 He
 hung
 lifted
 up
 as
 He
 had
 said
 He
 would
 be
 was
 that
 awful
 If
 hurled
 at
 Him
 by
 the
 devils
 emissaries
 in
 the
 time
 of
 mortal
 agony
 as
 in
 the
 season
 of
 the
 temptations
 immediately
 after
 His
 baptism
 it
 had
 been
 most
 insidiously
 pressed
 upon
 Him
 by
 the
 devil
 himself
 That
 If
 was
 Satans
 last
 shaft
 keenly
 barbed
 and
 doubly
 envenomed
 and
 it
 sped
 as
 with
 the
 fierce
 hiss
 of
 a
 viper
 Was
 it
 possible
 in
 this
 the
 final
 and
 most
 dreadful
 stage
 of
 Christs
 mission
 to
 make
 Him
 doubt
 His
 divine
 Sonship
 or
 failing
 such
 to
 taunt
 or
 anger
 the
 dying
 Savior
 into
 the
 use
 of
 His
 superhuman
 powers
 for
 personal
 relief
 or
 as
 an
 act
 of
 vengeance
 upon
 His
 tormentors
 To
 achieve
 such
 a
 victory
 was
 Satans
 desperate
 purpose
 The
 shaft
 failed
 Through
 taunts
 and
 derision
 through
 blasphemous
 challenge
 and
 diabolical
 goading
 the
 agonized
 Christ
 was
 silent
 Then
 one
 of
 the
 crucified
 thieves
 softened
 into
 penitence
 by
 the
 Saviors
 uncomplaining
 fortitude
 and
 perceiving
 in
 the
 divine
 Sufferers
 demeanor
 something
 more
 than
 human
 rebuked
 his
 railing
 fellow
 saying
 Dost
 not
 thou
 fear
 God
 seeing
 thou
 art
 in
 the
 same
 condemnation
 And
 we
 indeed
 justly
 for
 we
 receive
 the
 due
 reward
 of
 our
 deeds
 but
 this
 man
 hath
 done
 nothing
 amiss
 His
 confession
 of
 guilt
 and
 his
 acknowledgment
 of
 the
 justice
 of
 his
 own
 condemnation
 led
 to
 incipient
 repentance
 and
 to
 faith
 in
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 his
 companion
 in
 agony
 And
 he
 said
 unto
 Jesus
 Lord
 remember
 me
 when
 thou
 comest
 into
 thy
 kingdom
 To
 the
 appeal
 of
 penitence
 the
 Lord
 replied
 with
 such
 a
 promise
 as
 He
 alone
 could
 make
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 thee
 To
 day
 shalt
 thou
 be
 with
 me
 in
 paradise
 Among
 the
 spectators
 of
 this
 the
 greatest
 tragedy
 in
 history
 were
 some
 who
 had
 come
 in
 sympathy
 and
 sorrow
 No
 mention
 is
 found
 of
 the
 presence
 of
 any
 of
 the
 Twelve
 save
 one
 and
 he
 the
 disciple
 whom
 Jesus
 loved
 John
 the
 apostle
 evangelist
 and
 revelator
 but
 specific
 record
 is
 made
 of
 certain
 women
 who
 first
 at
 a
 distance
 and
 then
 close
 by
 the
 cross
 wept
 in
 the
 anguish
 of
 love
 and
 sorrow
 Now
 there
 stood
 by
 the
 cross
 of
 Jesus
 his
 mother
 and
 his
 mothers
 sister
 Mary
 the
 wife
 of
 Cleophas
 and
 Mary
 Magdalene
 In
 addition
 to
 the
 women
 named
 were
 many
 others
 some
 of
 whom
 had
 ministered
 unto
 Jesus
 in
 the
 course
 of
 His
 labors
 in
 Galilee
 and
 who
 were
 among
 those
 that
 had
 come
 up
 with
 Him
 to
 Jerusalem
 First
 in
 point
 of
 consideration
 among
 them
 all
 was
 Mary
 the
 mother
 of
 Jesus
 into
 whose
 soul
 the
 sword
 had
 pierced
 even
 as
 righteous
 Simeon
 had
 prophesied
 Jesus
 looking
 with
 tender
 compassion
 upon
 His
 weeping
 mother
 as
 she
 stood
 with
 John
 at
 the
 foot
 of
 the
 cross
 commended
 her
 to
 the
 care
 and
 protection
 of
 the
 beloved
 disciple
 with
 the
 words
 Woman
 behold
 thy
 son
 and
 to
 John
 Behold
 thy
 mother
 The
 disciple
 tenderly
 led
 the
 heartstricken
 Mary
 away
 from
 her
 dying
 Son
 and
 took
 her
 unto
 his
 own
 home
 thus
 immediately
 assuming
 the
 new
 relationship
 established
 by
 his
 dying
 Master
 Jesus
 was
 nailed
 to
 the
 cross
 during
 the
 forenoon
 of
 that
 fateful
 Friday
 probably
 between
 nine
 and
 ten
 oclock
 At
 noontide
 the
 light
 of
 the
 sun
 was
 obscured
 and
 black
 darkness
 spread
 over
 the
 whole
 land
 The
 terrifying
 gloom
 continued
 for
 a
 period
 of
 three
 hours
 This
 remarkable
 phenomenon
 has
 received
 no
 satisfactory
 explanation
 from
 science
 It
 could
 not
 have
 been
 due
 to
 a
 solar
 eclipse
 as
 has
 been
 suggested
 in
 ignorance
 for
 the
 time
 was
 that
 of
 full
 moon
 indeed
 the
 Passover
 season
 was
 determined
 by
 the
 first
 occurrence
 of
 full
 moon
 after
 the
 spring
 equinox
 The
 darkness
 was
 brought
 about
 by
 miraculous
 operation
 of
 natural
 laws
 directed
 by
 divine
 power
 It
 was
 a
 fitting
 sign
 of
 the
 earths
 deep
 mourning
 over
 the
 impending
 death
 of
 her
 Creator
 Of
 the
 mortal
 agony
 through
 which
 the
 Lord
 passed
 while
 upon
 the
 cross
 the
 Gospelscribes
 are
 reverently
 reticent
 At
 the
 ninth
 hour
 or
 about
 three
 in
 the
 afternoon
 a
 loud
 voice
 surpassing
 the
 most
 anguished
 cry
 of
 physical
 suffering
 issued
 from
 the
 central
 cross
 rending
 the
 dreadful
 darkness
 It
 was
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 Christ
 Eloi
 Eloi
 lama
 sabachthani
 which
 is
 being
 interpreted
 My
 God
 my
 God
 why
 hast
 thou
 forsaken
 me
 What
 mind
 of
 man
 can
 fathom
 the
 significance
 of
 that
 awful
 cry
 It
 seems
 that
 in
 addition
 to
 the
 fearful
 suffering
 incident
 to
 crucifixion
 the
 agony
 of
 Gethsemane
 had
 recurred
 intensified
 beyond
 human
 power
 to
 endure
 In
 that
 bitterest
 hour
 the
 dying
 Christ
 was
 alone
 alone
 in
 most
 terrible
 reality
 That
 the
 supreme
 sacrifice
 of
 the
 Son
 might
 be
 consummated
 in
 all
 its
 fulness
 the
 Father
 seems
 to
 have
 withdrawn
 the
 support
 of
 His
 immediate
 Presence
 leaving
 to
 the
 Savior
 of
 men
 the
 glory
 of
 complete
 victory
 over
 the
 forces
 of
 sin
 and
 death
 The
 cry
 from
 the
 cross
 though
 heard
 by
 all
 who
 were
 near
 was
 understood
 by
 few
 The
 first
 exclamation
 Eloi
 meaning
 My
 God
 was
 misunderstood
 as
 a
 call
 for
 Elias
 The
 period
 of
 faintness
 the
 conception
 of
 utter
 forsakenness
 soon
 passed
 and
 the
 natural
 cravings
 of
 the
 body
 reasserted
 themselves
 The
 maddening
 thirst
 which
 constituted
 one
 of
 the
 worst
 of
 the
 crucifixion
 agonies
 wrung
 from
 the
 Saviors
 lips
 His
 one
 recorded
 utterance
 expressive
 of
 physical
 suffering
 I
 thirst
 He
 said
 One
 of
 those
 who
 stood
 by
 whether
 Roman
 or
 Jew
 disciple
 or
 skeptic
 we
 are
 not
 told
 hastily
 saturated
 a
 sponge
 with
 vinegar
 a
 vessel
 of
 which
 was
 at
 hand
 and
 having
 fastened
 the
 sponge
 to
 the
 end
 of
 a
 reed
 or
 stalk
 of
 hyssop
 pressed
 it
 to
 the
 Lords
 fevered
 lips
 Some
 others
 would
 have
 prevented
 this
 one
 act
 of
 human
 response
 for
 they
 said
 Let
 be
 let
 us
 see
 whether
 Elias
 will
 come
 to
 save
 him
 John
 affirms
 that
 Christ
 uttered
 the
 exclamation
 I
 thirst
 only
 when
 He
 knew
 that
 all
 things
 were
 now
 accomplished
 and
 the
 apostle
 saw
 in
 the
 incident
 a
 fulfilment
 of
 prophecy
 Fully
 realizing
 that
 He
 was
 no
 longer
 forsaken
 but
 that
 His
 atoning
 sacrifice
 had
 been
 accepted
 by
 the
 Father
 and
 that
 His
 mission
 in
 the
 flesh
 had
 been
 carried
 to
 glorious
 consummation
 He
 exclaimed
 in
 a
 loud
 voice
 of
 holy
 triumph
 It
 is
 finished
 In
 reverence
 resignation
 and
 relief
 He
 addressed
 the
 Father
 saying
 Father
 into
 thy
 hands
 I
 commend
 my
 spirit
 He
 bowed
 His
 head
 and
 voluntarily
 gave
 up
 His
 life
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 was
 dead
 His
 life
 had
 not
 been
 taken
 from
 Him
 except
 as
 He
 had
 willed
 to
 permit
 Sweet
 and
 welcome
 as
 would
 have
 been
 the
 relief
 of
 death
 in
 any
 of
 the
 earlier
 stages
 of
 His
 suffering
 from
 Gethsemane
 to
 the
 cross
 He
 lived
 until
 all
 things
 were
 accomplished
 as
 had
 been
 appointed
 In
 the
 latter
 days
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 has
 been
 heard
 affirming
 the
 actuality
 of
 His
 suffering
 and
 death
 and
 the
 eternal
 purpose
 thereby
 accomplished
 Hear
 and
 heed
 His
 words
 For
 behold
 the
 Lord
 your
 Redeemer
 suffered
 death
 in
 the
 flesh
 wherefore
 he
 suffered
 the
 pain
 of
 all
 men
 that
 all
 men
 might
 repent
 and
 come
 unto
 him
 IMPORTANT
 OCCURRENCES
 BETWEEN
 THE
 LORDS
 DEATH
 AND
 BURIAL
 The
 death
 of
 Christ
 was
 accompanied
 by
 terrifying
 phenomena
 There
 was
 a
 violent
 earthquake
 the
 rocks
 of
 the
 mighty
 hills
 were
 disrupted
 and
 many
 graves
 were
 torn
 open
 But
 most
 portentous
 of
 all
 in
 Judaistic
 minds
 the
 veil
 of
 the
 temple
 which
 hung
 between
 the
 Holy
 Place
 and
 the
 Holy
 of
 Holies
 was
 rent
 from
 top
 to
 bottom
 and
 the
 interior
 which
 none
 but
 the
 high
 priest
 had
 been
 permitted
 to
 see
 was
 thrown
 open
 to
 common
 gaze
 It
 was
 the
 rending
 of
 Judaism
 the
 consummation
 of
 the
 Mosaic
 dispensation
 and
 the
 inauguration
 of
 Christianity
 under
 apostolic
 administration
 The
 Roman
 centurion
 and
 the
 soldiers
 under
 his
 command
 at
 the
 place
 of
 execution
 were
 amazed
 and
 greatly
 affrighted
 They
 had
 probably
 witnessed
 many
 deaths
 on
 the
 cross
 but
 never
 before
 had
 they
 seen
 a
 man
 apparently
 die
 of
 his
 own
 volition
 and
 able
 to
 cry
 in
 a
 loud
 voice
 at
 the
 moment
 of
 dissolution
 That
 barbarous
 and
 inhuman
 mode
 of
 execution
 induced
 slow
 and
 progressive
 exhaustion
 The
 actual
 death
 of
 Jesus
 appeared
 to
 all
 who
 were
 present
 to
 be
 a
 miracle
 as
 in
 fact
 it
 was
 This
 marvel
 coupled
 with
 the
 earthquake
 and
 its
 attendant
 horrors
 so
 impressed
 the
 centurion
 that
 he
 prayed
 to
 God
 and
 solemnly
 declared
 Certainly
 this
 was
 a
 righteous
 man
 Others
 joined
 in
 fearsome
 averment
 Truly
 this
 was
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 The
 terrified
 ones
 who
 spoke
 and
 those
 who
 heard
 left
 the
 place
 in
 a
 state
 of
 fear
 beating
 their
 breasts
 and
 bewailing
 what
 seemed
 to
 be
 a
 state
 of
 impending
 destruction
 A
 few
 loving
 women
 however
 watched
 from
 a
 distant
 point
 and
 saw
 all
 that
 took
 place
 until
 the
 Lords
 body
 was
 laid
 away
 It
 was
 now
 late
 in
 the
 afternoon
 at
 sunset
 the
 Sabbath
 would
 begin
 That
 approaching
 Sabbath
 was
 held
 to
 be
 more
 than
 ordinarily
 sacred
 for
 it
 was
 a
 high
 day
 in
 that
 it
 was
 the
 weekly
 Sabbath
 and
 a
 paschal
 holy
 day
 The
 Jewish
 officials
 who
 had
 not
 hesitated
 to
 slay
 their
 Lord
 were
 horrified
 at
 the
 thought
 of
 men
 left
 hanging
 on
 crosses
 on
 such
 a
 day
 for
 thereby
 the
 land
 would
 be
 defiled
 so
 these
 scrupulous
 rulers
 went
 to
 Pilate
 and
 begged
 that
 Jesus
 and
 the
 two
 malefactors
 be
 summarily
 dispatched
 by
 the
 brutal
 Roman
 method
 of
 breaking
 their
 legs
 the
 shock
 of
 which
 violent
 treatment
 had
 been
 found
 to
 be
 promptly
 fatal
 to
 the
 crucified
 The
 governor
 gave
 his
 consent
 and
 the
 soldiers
 broke
 the
 limbs
 of
 the
 two
 thieves
 with
 cudgels
 Jesus
 however
 was
 found
 to
 be
 already
 dead
 so
 they
 broke
 not
 His
 bones
 Christ
 the
 great
 Passover
 sacrifice
 of
 whom
 all
 altar
 victims
 had
 been
 but
 suggestive
 prototypes
 died
 through
 violence
 yet
 without
 a
 bone
 of
 His
 body
 being
 broken
 as
 was
 a
 prescribed
 condition
 of
 the
 slain
 paschal
 lambs
 One
 of
 the
 soldiers
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 Jesus
 was
 actually
 dead
 or
 to
 surely
 kill
 Him
 if
 He
 was
 yet
 alive
 drove
 a
 spear
 into
 His
 side
 making
 a
 wound
 large
 enough
 to
 permit
 a
 mans
 hand
 to
 be
 thrust
 thereinto
 The
 withdrawal
 of
 the
 spear
 was
 followed
 by
 an
 outflow
 of
 blood
 and
 water
 an
 occurrence
 so
 surprizing
 that
 John
 who
 was
 an
 eyewitness
 bears
 specific
 personal
 testimony
 to
 the
 fact
 and
 cites
 the
 scriptures
 thereby
 fulfilled
 THE
 BURIAL
 A
 man
 known
 as
 Joseph
 of
 Arimathea
 who
 was
 at
 heart
 a
 disciple
 of
 Christ
 but
 who
 had
 hesitated
 to
 openly
 confess
 his
 conversion
 through
 fear
 of
 the
 Jews
 desired
 to
 give
 the
 Lords
 body
 a
 decent
 and
 honorable
 interment
 But
 for
 some
 such
 divinely
 directed
 intervention
 the
 body
 of
 Jesus
 might
 have
 been
 cast
 into
 the
 common
 grave
 of
 executed
 criminals
 This
 man
 Joseph
 was
 a
 counsellor
 and
 he
 was
 a
 good
 man
 and
 a
 just
 It
 is
 expressly
 said
 of
 him
 that
 he
 had
 not
 consented
 to
 the
 counsel
 and
 deed
 of
 them
 from
 which
 statement
 we
 infer
 that
 he
 was
 a
 Sanhedrist
 and
 had
 been
 opposed
 to
 the
 action
 of
 his
 colleagues
 in
 condemning
 Jesus
 to
 death
 or
 at
 least
 had
 refrained
 from
 voting
 with
 the
 rest
 Joseph
 was
 a
 man
 of
 wealth
 station
 and
 influence
 He
 went
 in
 boldly
 unto
 Pilate
 and
 begged
 the
 body
 of
 Christ
 The
 governor
 was
 surprized
 to
 learn
 that
 Jesus
 was
 already
 dead
 he
 summoned
 the
 centurion
 and
 inquired
 as
 to
 how
 long
 Jesus
 had
 lived
 on
 the
 cross
 The
 unusual
 circumstance
 seems
 to
 have
 added
 to
 Pilates
 troubled
 concern
 He
 gave
 command
 and
 the
 body
 of
 Christ
 was
 delivered
 to
 Joseph
 The
 body
 was
 removed
 from
 the
 cross
 and
 in
 preparing
 it
 for
 the
 tomb
 Joseph
 was
 assisted
 by
 Nicodemus
 another
 member
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 the
 same
 who
 had
 come
 to
 Jesus
 by
 night
 three
 years
 before
 and
 who
 at
 one
 of
 the
 conspiracy
 meetings
 of
 the
 council
 had
 protested
 against
 the
 unlawful
 condemnation
 of
 Jesus
 without
 a
 hearing
 Nicodemus
 brought
 a
 large
 quantity
 of
 myrrh
 and
 aloes
 about
 a
 hundredweight
 The
 odorous
 mixture
 was
 highly
 esteemed
 for
 anointing
 and
 embalming
 but
 its
 cost
 restricted
 its
 use
 to
 the
 wealthy
 These
 two
 revering
 disciples
 wrapped
 the
 Lords
 body
 in
 clean
 linen
 with
 the
 spices
 as
 the
 manner
 of
 the
 Jews
 is
 to
 bury
 and
 then
 laid
 it
 in
 a
 new
 sepulchre
 hewn
 in
 the
 rock
 The
 tomb
 was
 in
 a
 garden
 not
 far
 from
 Calvary
 and
 was
 the
 property
 of
 Joseph
 Because
 of
 the
 nearness
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 the
 interment
 had
 to
 be
 made
 with
 haste
 the
 door
 of
 the
 sepulchre
 was
 closed
 a
 large
 stone
 was
 rolled
 against
 it
 and
 thus
 laid
 away
 the
 body
 was
 left
 to
 rest
 Some
 of
 the
 devoted
 women
 particularly
 Mary
 Magdalene
 and
 the
 other
 Mary
 who
 was
 the
 mother
 of
 James
 and
 Joses
 had
 watched
 the
 entombment
 from
 a
 distance
 and
 when
 it
 was
 completed
 they
 returned
 and
 prepared
 spices
 and
 ointments
 and
 rested
 the
 sabbath
 day
 according
 to
 the
 commandment
 THE
 SEPULCHRE
 GUARDED
 On
 the
 day
 following
 the
 preparation
 that
 is
 to
 say
 on
 Saturday
 the
 Sabbath
 and
 highday
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 Pharisees
 came
 in
 a
 body
 to
 Pilate
 saying
 Sir
 we
 remember
 that
 that
 deceiver
 said
 while
 he
 was
 yet
 alive
 After
 three
 days
 I
 will
 rise
 again
 Command
 therefore
 that
 the
 sepulchre
 be
 made
 sure
 until
 the
 third
 day
 lest
 his
 disciples
 come
 by
 night
 and
 steal
 him
 away
 and
 say
 unto
 the
 people
 He
 is
 risen
 from
 the
 dead
 so
 the
 last
 error
 shall
 be
 worse
 than
 the
 first
 It
 is
 evident
 that
 the
 most
 inveterate
 of
 the
 human
 enemies
 of
 Christ
 remembered
 His
 predictions
 of
 an
 assured
 resurrection
 on
 the
 third
 day
 after
 His
 death
 Pilate
 answered
 with
 terse
 assent
 Ye
 have
 a
 watch
 go
 your
 way
 make
 it
 as
 sure
 as
 ye
 can
 So
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 Pharisees
 satisfied
 themselves
 that
 the
 sepulchre
 was
 secure
 by
 seeing
 that
 the
 official
 seal
 was
 affixed
 at
 the
 junction
 of
 the
 great
 stone
 and
 the
 portal
 and
 that
 an
 armed
 guard
 was
 placed
 in
 charge

 CHAPTER
 
 
 Simon
 the
 CyrenianSimon
 upon
 whom
 the
 cross
 of
 Jesus
 was
 laid
 was
 a
 member
 of
 the
 Jewish
 colony
 in
 northern
 Africa
 which
 had
 been
 established
 nearly
 three
 centuries
 before
 the
 birth
 of
 Christ
 by
 Ptolemeus
 Lagi
 who
 transported
 thither
 great
 numbers
 of
 Jews
 from

 Cyrene
 the
 home
 of
 Simon
 was
 in
 the
 province
 of
 Libya
 its
 site
 is
 within
 the
 present
 boundaries
 of
 Tunis
 That
 the
 African
 Jews
 were
 numerous
 and
 influential
 is
 evidenced
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 they
 maintained
 a
 synagog
 in
 Jerusalem
 Acts
 
 for
 the

 of

 Rufus

 mother

 in
 friendly
 reference
 by
 Paul
 over
 a
 quarter
 of

 century

 death
 of

 Romans
 
 If
 this
 Rufus
 be
 one
 of
 the
 sons
 of
 Simon
 named
 by
 Mark
 
 as
 tradition
 indicates
 it
 is
 probable
 that
 Simons
 family
 was
 prominently
 identified
 with
 the
 Primitive
 Church
 As
 to
 whether
 Simon
 had
 become
 a
 disciple
 before
 the
 crucifixion
 or
 was
 converted
 through
 his
 compulsory
 service
 in
 bearing
 the
 Lords
 cross
 or
 became
 a
 member
 of
 the
 Church
 at
 a
 later
 date

 Christs
 Words
 to
 the
 Daughters
 of
 JerusalemThe
 time
 would
 come
 when
 the
 Old
 Testament
 curse
 of
 barrenness
 Hosea
 
 would
 be
 coveted
 as
 a
 blessing
 To
 show
 the
 fulfilment
 of
 this
 prophetic
 lament
 of
 Jesus
 it
 is
 not
 necessary
 to
 recall
 the
 harrowing
 details
 recorded
 by
 Josephus
 Wars
 vi
 
 when
 a
 frenzied
 mother
 roasted
 her
 own
 child
 and
 in
 the
 mockery
 of
 desperateness
 reserved
 the
 half
 of
 the
 horrible
 meal
 for
 those
 murderers
 who
 daily
 broke
 in
 upon
 her
 to
 rob
 her
 of
 what
 scanty
 food
 had
 been
 left
 her
 nor
 yet
 other
 of
 those
 incidents
 too
 revolting
 for
 needless
 repetition
 which
 the
 historian
 of
 the
 last
 siege
 of
 Jerusalem
 chronicles
 But
 how
 often
 these
 many
 centuries
 must
 Israels
 women
 have
 felt
 that
 terrible
 longing
 for
 childlessness
 and
 how
 often
 must
 the
 prayer
 of
 despair
 for
 the
 quick
 death
 of
 falling
 mountains
 and
 burying
 hills
 rather
 than
 prolonged
 torture
 Hosea
 
 have
 risen
 to
 the
 lips
 of
 Israels
 sufferers
 And
 yet
 even
 so
 these
 words
 were
 also
 prophetic
 of
 a
 still
 more
 terrible
 future
 Rev
 
 For
 if
 Israel
 had
 put
 such
 flame
 to
 its
 green
 tree
 how
 terribly
 would
 the
 divine
 judgment
 burn
 among
 the
 dry
 wood
 of
 an
 apostate
 and
 rebellious

 These

 met
 with

 painfully
 literal
 illustration
 when
 hundreds
 of
 the
 unhappy
 Jews
 at
 the
 siege

 Jerusalem
 hid
 themselves
 in
 the
 darkest
 and
 vilest
 subterranean
 recesses

 when

 no

 were

 The
 Place
 of
 a
 SkullThe
 Aramaic
 Hebrew
 name
 Golgotha
 the
 Greek
 Kranion
 and
 the
 Latin
 Calvaria
 or
 as
 Anglicized
 Calvary
 have
 the
 same
 meaning
 and
 connote
 a
 skull
 The
 name
 may
 have
 been
 applied
 with
 reference
 to
 topographical
 features
 as
 we
 speak
 of
 the
 brow
 of
 a
 hill
 or
 if
 the
 spot
 was
 the
 usual
 place
 of
 execution
 it
 may
 have
 been
 so
 called
 as
 expressive
 of
 death
 just
 as
 we
 call
 a
 skull
 a
 deaths
 head
 It
 is
 probable
 that
 the
 bodies
 of
 executed
 convicts
 were
 buried
 near
 the
 place
 of
 death
 and
 if
 Golgotha
 or
 Calvary
 was
 the
 appointed
 site
 for
 execution
 the
 exposure
 of
 skulls
 and
 other
 human
 bones
 through
 the
 ravages
 of
 beasts
 and
 by
 other
 means
 would
 not
 be
 surprizing
 though
 the
 leaving
 of
 bodies
 or
 any
 of
 their
 parts
 unburied
 was
 contrary
 to
 Jewish
 law
 and
 sentiment
 The
 origin
 of
 the
 name
 is
 of
 as
 little
 importance
 as
 are
 the
 many
 divergent
 suppositions
 concerning
 the
 exact
 location
 of
 the
 spot
 
 CrucifixionIt
 was
 unanimously
 considered
 the
 most
 horrible
 form
 of
 death
 Among
 the
 Romans
 also
 the
 degradation
 was
 a
 part
 of
 the
 infliction
 and
 the
 punishment
 if
 applied
 to
 freeman
 was
 only
 used
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 vilest
 criminals
 The
 criminal
 carried
 his
 own
 cross
 or
 at
 any
 rate
 a
 part
 of
 it
 Hence
 figuratively
 to
 take
 take
 up
 or
 bear
 ones
 cross
 is
 to
 endure
 suffering
 affliction
 or
 shame
 like
 a
 criminal
 on
 his
 way
 to
 the
 place
 of
 crucifixion
 Matt
 
 
 Luke
 
 etc
 The
 place
 of
 execution
 was
 outside
 the
 city
 
 Kings
 
 Acts
 
 Heb
 
 often
 in
 some
 public
 road
 or
 other
 conspicuous
 place
 Arrived
 at
 the
 place
 of
 execution
 the
 sufferer
 was
 stripped
 naked
 the
 dress
 being
 the
 perquisite
 of
 the
 soldiers
 Matt
 
 The
 cross
 was
 then
 driven
 into
 the
 ground
 so
 that
 the
 feet
 of
 the
 condemned
 were
 a
 foot
 or
 two
 above
 the
 earth
 and
 he
 was
 lifted
 upon
 it
 or
 else
 stretched
 upon
 it
 on
 the
 ground
 and
 then
 lifted
 with
 it
 It
 was
 the
 custom
 to
 station
 soldiers
 to
 watch
 the
 cross
 so
 as
 to
 prevent
 the
 removal
 of
 the
 sufferer
 while
 yet
 alive
 This
 was
 necessary
 from
 the
 lingering
 character
 of
 the
 death
 which
 sometimes
 did
 not
 supervene
 even
 for
 three
 days
 and
 was
 at
 last
 the
 result
 of
 gradual
 benumbing
 and
 starvation
 But
 for
 this
 guard
 the
 persons
 might
 have
 been
 taken
 down
 and
 recovered
 as
 was
 actually
 done
 in
 the
 case
 of
 a
 friend
 of
 Josephus
 In
 most
 cases
 the
 body
 was
 suffered
 to
 rot
 on
 the
 cross
 by
 the
 action
 of
 sun
 and
 rain
 or
 to
 be
 devoured
 by
 birds
 and
 beasts
 Sepulture
 was
 generally
 therefore
 forbidden
 but
 in
 consequence
 of
 Deut
 
 
 an
 express
 national
 exception
 was
 made
 in
 favor
 of
 the
 Jews

 time
 so
 specified
 corresponds

 This
 writer
 and
 his
 fellow
 synoptists
 Matthew
 and
 Luke
 give
 place
 to
 many
 incidents
 that
 occurred
 between
 the
 nailing
 of
 Christ
 to
 the
 cross
 and
 the
 sixth
 hour
 or
 the
 hour
 from
 
 noon
 to
 
 pm
 From
 these
 several
 accounts
 it
 is
 clear
 that
 Jesus
 was
 crucified
 during
 the
 forenoon
 A
 discrepancy
 plainly
 appears
 between
 these
 records
 and
 Johns
 statement
 
 that
 it
 was
 about
 the
 sixth
 hour
 noon
 when
 Pilate
 gave
 the
 sentence
 of

 All
 attempts
 to
 harmonize
 the
 accounts
 in
 this
 particular
 have
 proved
 futile
 because
 the
 discrepancy
 is
 real
 Most
 critics
 and
 commentators
 assume
 that
 about
 the
 sixth
 hour
 in
 Johns
 account
 is
 a
 misstatement
 due
 to
 the
 errors
 of

 The
 Physical
 Cause
 of
 Christs
 DeathWhile
 as
 stated
 in
 the
 text
 the
 yielding
 up
 of
 life
 was
 voluntary
 on
 the
 part
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 for
 He
 had
 life
 in
 Himself
 and
 no
 man
 could
 take
 His
 life
 except
 as
 He
 willed
 to
 allow
 it
 to
 be
 taken
 John
 
 
 
 there
 was
 of
 necessity
 a
 direct
 physical
 cause
 of
 dissolution
 As
 stated
 also
 the
 crucified
 sometimes
 lived
 for
 days
 upon
 the
 cross
 and
 death
 resulted
 not
 from
 the
 infliction
 of
 mortal
 wounds
 but
 from
 internal
 congestion
 inflammations
 organic
 disturbances
 and
 consequent
 exhaustion
 of
 vital
 energy
 Jesus
 though
 weakened
 by
 long
 torture
 during
 the
 preceding
 night
 and
 early
 morning
 by
 the
 shock
 of
 the
 crucifixion
 itself
 as
 also
 by
 intense
 mental
 agony
 and
 particularly
 through
 spiritual
 suffering
 such
 as
 no
 other
 man
 has
 ever
 endured
 manifested
 surprizing
 vigor
 both
 of
 mind
 and
 body
 to
 the
 last
 The
 strong
 loud
 utterance
 immediately
 following
 which
 He
 bowed
 His
 head
 and
 gave
 up
 the
 ghost
 when
 considered
 in
 connection
 with
 other
 recorded
 details
 points
 to
 a
 physical
 rupture
 of
 the
 heart
 as
 the
 direct
 cause
 of
 death
 If
 the
 soldiers
 spear
 was
 thrust
 into
 the
 left
 side
 of
 the
 Lords
 body
 and
 actually
 penetrated
 the
 heart
 the
 outrush
 of
 blood
 and
 water
 observed
 by
 John
 is
 further
 evidence
 of
 a
 cardiac
 rupture
 for
 it
 is
 known
 that
 in
 the
 rare
 instances
 of
 death
 resulting
 from
 a
 breaking
 of
 any
 part
 of
 the
 wall
 of
 the
 heart
 blood
 accumulates
 within
 the
 pericardium
 and
 there
 undergoes
 a
 change
 by
 which
 the
 corpuscles
 separate
 as
 a
 partially
 clotted
 mass
 from
 the
 almost
 colorless
 watery
 serum
 Similar
 accumulations
 of
 clotted
 corpuscles
 and
 serum
 occur
 within
 the
 pleura
 Dr
 Abercrombie
 of
 Edinburgh
 as
 cited
 by
 Deems
 Light
 of
 the
 Nations
 p
 
 gives
 a
 case
 of
 the
 sudden
 death
 of
 a
 man
 aged
 seventyseven
 years
 owing
 to
 a
 rupture
 of
 the
 heart
 In
 his
 case
 the
 cavities
 of
 the
 pleura
 contained
 about
 three
 pounds
 of
 fluid
 but
 the
 lungs
 were
 sound
 Deems
 also
 cites
 the
 following
 instance
 Dr
 Elliotson
 relates
 the
 case
 of
 a
 woman
 who
 died
 suddenly
 On
 opening
 the
 body
 the
 pericardium
 was
 found
 distended
 with
 clear
 serum
 and
 a
 very
 large
 coagulum
 of
 blood
 which
 had
 escaped
 through
 a
 spontaneous
 rupture
 of
 the
 aorta
 near
 its
 origin
 without
 any
 other
 morbid
 appearance
 Many
 cases
 might
 be
 cited
 but
 these
 suffice

 ground
 that
 to
 do
 what
 these
 priestly
 officials
 did
 in
 personally
 supervizing
 the
 sealing
 of

 would
 have
 been
 to
 incur
 defilement

 that
 they

 done

 CHAPTER
 
 IN
 THE
 REALM
 OF
 DISEMBODIED
 SPIRITS
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 died
 in
 the
 literal
 sense
 in
 which
 all
 men
 die
 He
 underwent
 a
 physical
 dissolution
 by
 which
 His
 immortal
 spirit
 was
 separated
 from
 His
 body
 of
 flesh
 and
 bones
 and
 that
 body
 was
 actually
 dead
 While
 the
 corpse
 lay
 in
 Josephs
 rockhewn
 tomb
 the
 living
 Christ
 existed
 as
 a
 disembodied
 Spirit
 We
 are
 justified
 in
 inquiring
 where
 He
 was
 and
 what
 were
 His
 activities
 during
 the
 interval
 between
 His
 death
 on
 the
 cross
 and
 His
 emergence
 from
 the
 sepulchre
 with
 spirit
 and
 body
 reunited
 a
 resurrected
 Soul
 The
 assumption
 that
 most
 naturally
 suggests
 itself
 is
 that
 He
 went
 where
 the
 spirits
 of
 the
 dead
 ordinarily
 go
 and
 that
 in
 the
 sense
 in
 which
 while
 in
 the
 flesh
 He
 had
 been
 a
 Man
 among
 men
 He
 was
 in
 the
 disembodied
 state
 a
 Spirit
 among
 spirits
 This
 conception
 is
 confirmed
 as
 a
 fact
 by
 scriptural
 attestation
 As
 heretofore
 shown
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 the
 chosen
 and
 ordained
 Redeemer
 and
 Savior
 of
 mankind
 to
 this
 exalted
 mission
 He
 had
 been
 set
 apart
 in
 the
 beginning
 even
 before
 the
 earth
 was
 prepared
 as
 the
 abode
 of
 mankind
 Unnumbered
 hosts
 who
 had
 never
 heard
 the
 gospel
 lived
 and
 died
 upon
 the
 earth
 before
 the
 birth
 of
 Jesus
 Of
 those
 departed
 myriads
 many
 had
 passed
 their
 mortal
 probation
 with
 varying
 degrees
 of
 righteous
 observance
 of
 the
 law
 of
 God
 so
 far
 as
 it
 had
 been
 made
 known
 unto
 them
 but
 had
 died
 in
 unblamable
 ignorance
 of
 the
 gospel
 while
 other
 multitudes
 had
 lived
 and
 died
 as
 transgressors
 even
 against
 such
 moiety
 of
 Gods
 law
 to
 man
 as
 they
 had
 learned
 and
 such
 as
 they
 had
 professed
 to
 obey
 Death
 had
 claimed
 as
 its
 own
 all
 of
 these
 both
 just
 and
 unjust
 To
 them
 went
 the
 Christ
 bearing
 the
 transcendently
 glorious
 tidings
 of
 redemption
 from
 the
 bondage
 of
 death
 and
 of
 possible
 salvation
 from
 the
 effects
 of
 individual
 sin
 This
 labor
 was
 part
 of
 the
 Saviors
 foreappointed
 and
 unique
 service
 to
 the
 human
 family
 The
 shout
 of
 divine
 exultation
 from
 the
 cross
 It
 is
 finished
 signified
 the
 consummation
 of
 the
 Lords
 mission
 in
 mortality
 yet
 there
 remained
 to
 Him
 other
 ministry
 to
 be
 rendered
 prior
 to
 His
 return
 to
 the
 Father
 To
 the
 penitent
 transgressor
 crucified
 by
 His
 side
 who
 reverently
 craved
 remembrance
 when
 the
 Lord
 should
 come
 into
 His
 kingdom
 Christ
 had
 given
 the
 comforting
 assurance
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 thee
 Today
 shalt
 thou
 be
 with
 me
 in
 paradise
 The
 spirit
 of
 Jesus
 and
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 repentant
 thief
 left
 their
 crucified
 bodies
 and
 went
 to
 the
 same
 place
 in
 the
 realm
 of
 the
 departed
 On
 the
 third
 day
 following
 Jesus
 then
 a
 resurrected
 Being
 positively
 stated
 to
 the
 weeping
 Magdalene
 I
 am
 not
 yet
 ascended
 to
 my
 Father
 He
 had
 gone
 to
 paradise
 but
 not
 to
 the
 place
 where
 God
 dwells
 Paradise
 therefore
 is
 not
 Heaven
 if
 by
 the
 latter
 term
 we
 understand
 the
 abode
 of
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 and
 His
 celestialized
 children
 Paradise
 is
 a
 place
 where
 dwell
 righteous
 and
 repentant
 spirits
 between
 bodily
 death
 and
 resurrection
 Another
 division
 of
 the
 spirit
 world
 is
 reserved
 for
 those
 disembodied
 beings
 who
 have
 lived
 lives
 of
 wickedness
 and
 who
 remain
 impenitent
 even
 after
 death
 Alma
 a
 Nephite
 prophet
 thus
 spake
 of
 the
 conditions
 prevailing
 among
 the
 departed
 Now
 concerning
 the
 state
 of
 the
 soul
 between
 death
 and
 the
 resurrection
 Behold
 it
 has
 been
 made
 known
 unto
 me
 by
 an
 angel
 that
 the
 spirits
 of
 all
 men
 as
 soon
 as
 they
 are
 departed
 from
 this
 mortal
 body
 yea
 the
 spirits
 of
 all
 men
 whether
 they
 be
 good
 or
 evil
 are
 taken
 home
 to
 that
 God
 who
 gave
 them
 life
 And
 then
 shall
 it
 come
 to
 pass
 that
 the
 spirits
 of
 those
 who
 are
 righteous
 are
 received
 into
 a
 state
 of
 happiness
 which
 is
 called
 paradise
 a
 state
 of
 rest
 a
 state
 of
 peace
 where
 they
 shall
 rest
 from
 all
 their
 troubles
 and
 from
 all
 care
 and
 sorrow
 c
 And
 then
 shall
 it
 come
 to
 pass
 that
 the
 spirits
 of
 the
 wicked
 yea
 who
 are
 evil
 for
 behold
 they
 have
 no
 part
 nor
 portion
 of
 the
 Spirit
 of
 the
 Lord
 for
 behold
 they
 chose
 evil
 works
 rather
 than
 good
 therefore
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 devil
 did
 enter
 into
 them
 and
 take
 possession
 of
 their
 house
 and
 these
 shall
 be
 cast
 out
 into
 outer
 darkness
 there
 shall
 be
 weeping
 and
 wailing
 and
 gnashing
 of
 teeth
 and
 this
 because
 of
 their
 own
 iniquity
 being
 led
 captive
 by
 the
 will
 of
 the
 devil
 Now
 this
 is
 the
 state
 of
 the
 souls
 of
 the
 wicked
 yea
 in
 darkness
 and
 a
 state
 of
 awful
 fearful
 looking
 for
 the
 fiery
 indignation
 of
 the
 wrath
 of
 God
 upon
 them
 thus
 they
 remain
 in
 this
 state
 as
 well
 as
 the
 righteous
 in
 paradise
 until
 the
 time
 of
 their
 resurrection
 While
 divested
 of
 His
 body
 Christ
 ministered
 among
 the
 departed
 both
 in
 paradise
 and
 in
 the
 prison
 realm
 where
 dwelt
 in
 a
 state
 of
 durance
 the
 spirits
 of
 the
 disobedient
 To
 this
 effect
 testified
 Peter
 nearly
 three
 decades
 after
 the
 great
 event
 For
 Christ
 also
 hath
 once
 suffered
 for
 sins
 the
 just
 for
 the
 unjust
 that
 he
 might
 bring
 us
 to
 God
 being
 put
 to
 death
 in
 the
 flesh
 but
 quickened
 by
 the
 Spirit
 By
 which
 also
 he
 went
 and
 preached
 unto
 the
 spirits
 in
 prison
 Which
 sometime
 were
 disobedient
 when
 once
 the
 longsuffering
 of
 God
 waited
 in
 the
 days
 of
 Noah
 while
 the
 ark
 was
 a
 preparing
 wherein
 few
 that
 is
 eight
 souls
 were
 saved
 by
 water
 The
 disobedient
 who
 had
 lived
 on
 earth
 in
 the
 Noachian
 period
 are
 especially
 mentioned
 as
 beneficiaries
 of
 the
 Lords
 ministry
 in
 the
 spirit
 world
 They
 had
 been
 guilty
 of
 gross
 offenses
 and
 had
 wantonly
 rejected
 the
 teachings
 and
 admonitions
 of
 Noah
 the
 earthly
 minister
 of
 Jehovah
 For
 their
 flagrant
 sin
 they
 had
 been
 destroyed
 in
 the
 flesh
 and
 their
 spirits
 had
 endured
 in
 a
 condition
 of
 imprisonment
 without
 hope
 from
 the
 time
 of
 their
 death
 to
 the
 advent
 of
 Christ
 who
 came
 as
 a
 Spirit
 amongst
 them
 We
 are
 not
 to
 assume
 from
 Peters
 illustrative
 mention
 of
 the
 disobedient
 antediluvians
 that
 they
 alone
 were
 included
 in
 the
 blessed
 opportunities
 offered
 through
 Christs
 ministry
 in
 the
 spirit
 realm
 on
 the
 contrary
 we
 conclude
 in
 reason
 and
 consistency
 that
 all
 whose
 wickedness
 in
 the
 flesh
 had
 brought
 their
 spirits
 into
 the
 prison
 house
 were
 sharers
 in
 the
 possibilities
 of
 expiation
 repentance
 and
 release
 Justice
 demanded
 that
 the
 gospel
 be
 preached
 among
 the
 dead
 as
 it
 had
 been
 and
 was
 to
 be
 yet
 more
 widely
 preached
 among
 the
 living
 Let
 us
 consider
 the
 further
 affirmation
 of
 Peter
 as
 part
 of
 his
 pastoral
 admonition
 to
 the
 members
 of
 the
 Primitive
 Church
 Who
 shall
 give
 account
 to
 him
 that
 is
 ready
 to
 judge
 the
 quick
 and
 the
 dead
 For
 this
 cause
 was
 the
 gospel
 preached
 also
 to
 them
 that
 are
 dead
 that
 they
 might
 be
 judged
 according
 to
 men
 in
 the
 flesh
 but
 live
 according
 to
 God
 in
 the
 spirit
 That
 Jesus
 knew
 while
 yet
 in
 the
 body
 that
 His
 mission
 as
 the
 universal
 Redeemer
 and
 Savior
 of
 the
 race
 would
 not
 be
 complete
 when
 He
 came
 to
 die
 is
 sufficiently
 demonstrated
 by
 His
 words
 to
 the
 casuistical
 Jews
 following
 the
 Sabbath
 day
 healing
 at
 Bethesda
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 The
 hour
 is
 coming
 and
 now
 is
 when
 the
 dead
 shall
 hear
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 and
 they
 that
 hear
 shall
 live
 For
 as
 the
 Father
 hath
 life
 in
 himself
 so
 hath
 he
 given
 to
 the
 Son
 to
 have
 life
 in
 himself
 and
 hath
 given
 him
 authority
 to
 execute
 judgment
 also
 because
 he
 is
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 Marvel
 not
 at
 this
 for
 the
 hour
 is
 coming
 in
 the
 which
 all
 that
 are
 in
 the
 graves
 shall
 hear
 his
 voice
 and
 shall
 come
 forth
 they
 that
 have
 done
 good
 unto
 the
 resurrection
 of
 life
 and
 they
 that
 have
 done
 evil
 unto
 the
 resurrection
 of
 damnation
 The
 solemn
 truth
 that
 through
 the
 atonement
 of
 Christ
 salvation
 would
 be
 made
 possible
 to
 the
 dead
 as
 well
 as
 to
 the
 living
 was
 revealed
 to
 the
 prophets
 centuries
 before
 the
 meridian
 of
 time
 Isaiah
 was
 permitted
 to
 foresee
 the
 fate
 of
 the
 ungodly
 and
 the
 state
 prepared
 for
 haughty
 and
 rebellious
 offenders
 against
 righteousness
 but
 the
 dread
 vision
 was
 in
 part
 brightened
 by
 the
 deliverance
 that
 had
 been
 provided
 And
 it
 shall
 come
 to
 pass
 in
 that
 day
 that
 the
 Lord
 shall
 punish
 the
 host
 of
 the
 high
 ones
 that
 are
 on
 high
 and
 the
 kings
 of
 the
 earth
 upon
 the
 earth
 And
 they
 shall
 be
 gathered
 together
 as
 prisoners
 are
 gathered
 in
 the
 pit
 and
 shall
 be
 shut
 up
 in
 the
 prison
 and
 after
 many
 days
 shall
 they
 be
 visited
 To
 the
 same
 mighty
 prophet
 was
 shown
 the
 universality
 of
 the
 Saviors
 atoning
 victory
 as
 comprizing
 the
 redemption
 of
 Jew
 and
 Gentile
 living
 and
 dead
 and
 convincingly
 he
 voiced
 the
 word
 of
 revelation
 Thus
 saith
 God
 the
 Lord
 he
 that
 created
 the
 heavens
 and
 stretched
 them
 out
 he
 that
 spread
 forth
 the
 earth
 and
 that
 which
 cometh
 out
 of
 it
 he
 that
 giveth
 breath
 unto
 the
 people
 upon
 it
 and
 spirit
 to
 them
 that
 walk
 therein
 I
 the
 Lord
 have
 called
 thee
 in
 righteousness
 and
 will
 hold
 thine
 hand
 and
 will
 keep
 thee
 and
 give
 thee
 for
 a
 covenant
 of
 the
 people
 for
 a
 light
 of
 the
 Gentiles
 to
 open
 the
 blind
 eyes
 to
 bring
 out
 the
 prisoners
 from
 the
 prison
 and
 them
 that
 sit
 in
 darkness
 out
 of
 the
 prison
 house
 David
 singing
 the
 praises
 of
 the
 Redeemer
 whose
 dominion
 should
 extend
 even
 to
 the
 souls
 in
 hell
 shouted
 in
 joy
 at
 the
 prospect
 of
 deliverance
 Therefore
 my
 heart
 is
 glad
 and
 my
 glory
 rejoiceth
 my
 flesh
 also
 shall
 rest
 in
 hope
 For
 thou
 wilt
 not
 leave
 my
 soul
 in
 hell
 neither
 wilt
 thou
 suffer
 thine
 Holy
 One
 to
 see
 corruption
 Thou
 wilt
 shew
 me
 the
 path
 of
 life
 in
 thy
 presence
 is
 fulness
 of
 joy
 at
 thy
 right
 hand
 there
 are
 pleasures
 for
 evermore
 From
 these
 and
 other
 scriptures
 it
 is
 evident
 that
 the
 ministry
 of
 Christ
 among
 the
 disembodied
 was
 foreseen
 predicted
 and
 accomplished
 The
 fact
 that
 the
 gospel
 was
 preached
 to
 the
 dead
 necessarily
 implies
 the
 possibility
 of
 the
 dead
 accepting
 the
 same
 and
 availing
 themselves
 of
 the
 saving
 opportunities
 thereof
 In
 the
 merciful
 providence
 of
 the
 Almighty
 provision
 has
 been
 made
 for
 vicarious
 service
 by
 the
 living
 for
 the
 dead
 in
 the
 ordinances
 essential
 to
 salvation
 so
 that
 all
 who
 in
 the
 spiritworld
 accept
 the
 word
 of
 God
 as
 preached
 to
 them
 develop
 true
 faith
 in
 Jesus
 Christ
 as
 the
 one
 and
 only
 Savior
 and
 contritely
 repent
 of
 their
 transgressions
 shall
 be
 brought
 under
 the
 saving
 effect
 of
 baptism
 by
 water
 for
 the
 remission
 of
 sins
 and
 be
 recipients
 of
 the
 baptism
 of
 the
 Spirit
 or
 the
 bestowal
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 Paul
 cites
 the
 principle
 and
 practise
 of
 baptism
 by
 the
 living
 for
 the
 dead
 as
 proof
 of
 the
 actuality
 of
 the
 resurrection
 Else
 what
 shall
 they
 do
 which
 are
 baptized
 for
 the
 dead
 if
 the
 dead
 rise
 not
 at
 all
 why
 are
 they
 then
 baptized
 for
 the
 dead
 Free
 agency
 the
 divine
 birthright
 of
 every
 human
 soul
 will
 not
 be
 annulled
 by
 death
 Only
 as
 the
 spirits
 of
 the
 dead
 become
 penitent
 and
 faithful
 will
 they
 be
 benefited
 by
 the
 vicarious
 service
 rendered
 in
 their
 behalf
 on
 earth
 Missionary
 labor
 among
 the
 dead
 was
 inaugurated
 by
 the
 Christ
 who
 of
 us
 can
 doubt
 that
 it
 has
 been
 continued
 by
 His
 authorized
 servants
 the
 disembodied
 who
 while
 in
 the
 flesh
 had
 been
 commissioned
 to
 preach
 the
 gospel
 and
 administer
 in
 the
 ordinances
 thereof
 through
 ordination
 in
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 That
 the
 faithful
 apostles
 who
 were
 left
 to
 build
 up
 the
 Church
 on
 earth
 following
 the
 departure
 of
 its
 divine
 Founder
 that
 other
 ministers
 of
 the
 word
 of
 God
 ordained
 to
 the
 Priesthood
 by
 authority
 in
 the
 Primitive
 as
 well
 as
 in
 the
 Latterday
 Church
 have
 passed
 from
 ministerial
 service
 among
 mortals
 to
 a
 continuation
 of
 such
 labor
 among
 the
 disembodied
 is
 so
 abundantly
 implied
 in
 scripture
 as
 to
 be
 made
 a
 certainty
 They
 are
 called
 to
 follow
 in
 the
 footsteps
 of
 the
 Master
 ministering
 here
 among
 the
 living
 and
 beyond
 among
 the
 dead
 The
 victory
 of
 Christ
 over
 death
 and
 sin
 would
 be
 incomplete
 were
 its
 effects
 confined
 to
 the
 small
 minority
 who
 have
 heard
 accepted
 and
 lived
 the
 gospel
 of
 salvation
 in
 the
 flesh
 Compliance
 with
 the
 laws
 and
 ordinances
 of
 the
 gospel
 is
 essential
 to
 salvation
 Nowhere
 in
 scripture
 is
 a
 distinction
 made
 in
 this
 regard
 between
 the
 living
 and
 the
 dead
 The
 dead
 are
 those
 who
 have
 lived
 in
 mortality
 upon
 earth
 the
 living
 are
 mortals
 who
 yet
 shall
 pass
 through
 the
 ordained
 change
 which
 we
 call
 death
 All
 are
 children
 of
 the
 same
 Father
 all
 to
 be
 judged
 and
 rewarded
 or
 punished
 by
 the
 same
 unerring
 justice
 with
 the
 same
 interposition
 of
 benign
 mercy
 Christs
 atoning
 sacrifice
 was
 offered
 not
 alone
 for
 the
 few
 who
 lived
 upon
 the
 earth
 while
 He
 was
 in
 the
 flesh
 nor
 for
 those
 who
 were
 to
 be
 born
 in
 mortality
 after
 His
 death
 but
 for
 all
 inhabitants
 of
 earth
 then
 past
 present
 and
 future
 He
 was
 ordained
 of
 the
 Father
 to
 be
 a
 judge
 of
 both
 quick
 and
 dead
 He
 is
 Lord
 alike
 of
 living
 and
 dead
 as
 men
 speak
 of
 dead
 and
 living
 though
 all
 are
 to
 be
 placed
 in
 the
 same
 position
 before
 Him
 there
 will
 be
 but
 a
 single
 class
 for
 all
 live
 unto
 Him
 While
 His
 body
 reposed
 in
 the
 tomb
 Christ
 was
 actively
 engaged
 in
 the
 further
 accomplishment
 of
 the
 Fathers
 purposes
 by
 offering
 the

 NOTES
 TO
 CHAPTER
 
 
 ParadiseThe
 scriptures
 prove
 that
 at
 the
 time
 of
 the
 final
 judgment
 every
 man
 will
 stand
 before
 the
 bar
 of
 God
 clothed
 in
 his
 resurrected
 body
 and
 this
 irrespective
 of
 his
 condition
 of
 righteousness
 or
 guilt
 While
 awaiting
 resurrection
 disembodied
 spirits
 exist
 in
 an
 intermediate
 state
 of
 happiness
 and
 rest
 or
 of
 suffering
 and
 suspense
 according
 to
 the
 course
 they
 have
 elected
 to
 follow
 in
 mortality
 Reference
 to
 paradise
 as
 the
 abode
 of
 righteous
 spirits
 between
 the
 time
 of
 death
 and
 that
 of
 the
 resurrection
 is
 made
 by
 the
 prophet
 Nephi

 import

 The
 word
 paradise
 by
 its
 derivation
 through
 the
 Greek
 from
 the
 Persian
 signifies
 a
 pleasant
 place
 or
 a
 place
 of
 restful
 enjoyment

 The
 Articles

 note
 
 By
 many
 the
 terms
 hades
 and
 sheol
 are
 understood
 to
 designate
 the
 place
 of
 departed
 spirits
 comprizing
 both
 paradise
 and
 the
 prison
 realm
 by
 others
 the
 terms
 are
 applied
 only
 to
 the
 latter
 the
 place
 of
 the
 wicked
 which
 is
 apart
 from
 paradise
 the
 abode
 of
 the
 just
 The
 assumption
 that
 the
 gracious
 assurance
 given
 by
 Christ
 to
 the
 penitent
 sinner
 on
 the
 cross
 was
 a
 remission
 of
 the
 mans
 sins
 and
 a
 passport
 into
 heaven
 is
 wholly
 contrary
 to
 both
 the
 letter
 and
 spirit
 of
 scripture
 reason
 and
 justice
 Confidence
 in
 the
 efficacy
 of
 deathbed
 professions
 and
 confessions
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 this
 incident
 is
 of
 the
 most
 insecure
 foundation
 The
 crucified
 malefactor
 manifested
 both
 faith
 and
 repentance
 his
 promised
 blessing
 was
 that
 he
 should
 that
 day
 hear
 the
 gospel
 preached
 in
 paradise
 in
 the
 acceptance
 or
 rejection
 of
 the
 word
 of
 life
 he
 would
 be
 an
 agent
 unto
 himself
 The
 requirement
 of
 obedience
 to
 the
 laws
 and
 ordinances
 of
 the
 gospel
 as
 an
 essential
 to
 salvation
 was
 not
 waived
 suspended
 or
 superseded
 in
 his
 case
 
 The
 Scripture
 Relating
 to
 Christ
 Among
 the
 Spirits
 in
 PrisonThe
 revised
 version
 of
 
 Peter
 
 reads
 Because
 Christ
 also
 suffered
 for
 sins
 once
 the
 righteous
 for
 the
 unrighteous
 that
 he
 might
 bring
 us
 to
 God
 being
 put
 to
 death
 in
 the
 flesh
 but
 quickened
 in
 the
 spirit
 in
 which
 also
 he
 went
 and
 preached
 unto
 the
 spirits
 in
 prison
 which
 aforetime
 were
 disobedient
 when
 the
 longsuffering
 of
 God
 waited
 in
 the
 days
 of
 Noah
 while
 the
 ark
 was
 a
 preparing
 wherein
 few
 that
 is
 eight
 souls
 were
 saved
 through
 water
 This
 is
 regarded
 by
 scholars
 as
 a
 closer
 approach
 to
 accuracy
 in
 translation
 than
 the
 common
 version
 Certain
 important
 differences
 between
 the
 two
 versions
 will
 appear
 to
 the
 studious
 reader
 The
 common
 version
 of
 the
 latter
 part
 of
 verse
 
 and
 the
 whole
 of
 verse
 
 reads
 being
 put
 to
 death
 in
 the
 flesh
 but
 quickened
 by
 the
 spirit
 By
 which
 also
 he
 went
 and
 preached
 unto
 the
 spirits
 in
 prison
 The
 revised
 text
 expresses
 the
 true
 thought
 that
 Christ
 was
 quickened
 that
 is
 to
 say
 was
 active
 in
 His
 own
 spirit
 state
 although
 His
 body
 was
 inert
 and
 in
 reality
 dead
 at
 the
 time
 and
 that
 in
 that
 disembodied
 state
 He
 went
 and
 preached
 to
 the
 disobedient
 spirits
 The
 later
 reading
 fixes
 the
 time
 of
 our
 Lords
 ministry
 among
 the
 departed
 as
 the
 interval
 between
 His
 death
 and
 resurrection

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 RESURRECTION
 AND
 THE
 ASCENSION
 CHRIST
 IS
 RISEN
 Saturday
 the
 Jewish
 Sabbath
 had
 passed
 and
 the
 night
 preceding
 the
 dawn
 of
 the
 most
 memorable
 Sunday
 in
 history
 was
 well
 nigh
 spent
 while
 the
 Roman
 guard
 kept
 watch
 over
 the
 sealed
 sepulchre
 wherein
 lay
 the
 body
 of
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 While
 it
 was
 yet
 dark
 the
 earth
 began
 to
 quake
 an
 angel
 of
 the
 Lord
 descended
 in
 glory
 rolled
 back
 the
 massive
 stone
 from
 the
 portal
 of
 the
 tomb
 and
 sat
 upon
 it
 His
 countenance
 was
 brilliant
 as
 the
 lightning
 and
 his
 raiment
 was
 as
 the
 driven
 snow
 for
 whiteness
 The
 soldiers
 paralyzed
 with
 fear
 fell
 to
 the
 earth
 as
 dead
 men
 When
 they
 had
 partially
 recovered
 from
 their
 fright
 they
 fled
 from
 the
 place
 in
 terror
 Even
 the
 rigor
 of
 Roman
 discipline
 which
 decreed
 summary
 death
 to
 every
 soldier
 who
 deserted
 his
 post
 could
 not
 deter
 them
 Moreover
 there
 was
 nothing
 left
 for
 them
 to
 guard
 the
 seal
 of
 authority
 had
 been
 broken
 the
 sepulchre
 was
 open
 and
 empty
 At
 the
 earliest
 indication
 of
 dawn
 the
 devoted
 Mary
 Magdalene
 and
 other
 faithful
 women
 set
 out
 for
 the
 tomb
 bearing
 spices
 and
 ointments
 which
 they
 had
 prepared
 for
 the
 further
 anointing
 of
 the
 body
 of
 Jesus
 Some
 of
 them
 had
 been
 witnesses
 of
 the
 burial
 and
 were
 conscious
 of
 the
 necessary
 haste
 with
 which
 the
 corpse
 had
 been
 wrapped
 with
 spicery
 and
 laid
 away
 by
 Joseph
 and
 Nicodemus
 just
 before
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 Sabbath
 and
 now
 these
 adoring
 women
 came
 early
 to
 render
 loving
 service
 in
 a
 more
 thorough
 anointing
 and
 external
 embalmment
 of
 the
 body
 On
 the
 way
 as
 they
 sorrowfully
 conversed
 they
 seemingly
 for
 the
 first
 time
 thought
 of
 the
 difficulty
 of
 entering
 the
 tomb
 Who
 shall
 roll
 us
 away
 the
 stone
 from
 the
 door
 of
 the
 sepulchre
 they
 asked
 one
 of
 another
 Evidently
 they
 knew
 nothing
 of
 the
 seal
 and
 the
 guard
 of
 soldiery
 At
 the
 tomb
 they
 saw
 the
 angel
 and
 were
 afraid
 but
 he
 said
 unto
 them
 Fear
 not
 ye
 for
 I
 know
 that
 ye
 seek
 Jesus
 which
 was
 crucified
 He
 is
 not
 here
 for
 he
 is
 risen
 as
 he
 said
 Come
 see
 the
 place
 where
 the
 Lord
 lay
 And
 go
 quickly
 and
 tell
 his
 disciples
 that
 he
 is
 risen
 from
 the
 dead
 and
 behold
 he
 goeth
 before
 you
 into
 Galilee
 there
 shall
 ye
 see
 him
 lo
 I
 have
 told
 you
 The
 women
 though
 favored
 by
 angelic
 visitation
 and
 assurance
 left
 the
 place
 amazed
 and
 frightened
 Mary
 Magdalene
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 the
 first
 to
 carry
 word
 to
 the
 disciples
 concerning
 the
 empty
 tomb
 She
 had
 failed
 to
 comprehend
 the
 gladsome
 meaning
 of
 the
 angels
 proclamation
 He
 is
 risen
 as
 he
 said
 in
 her
 agony
 of
 love
 and
 grief
 she
 remembered
 only
 the
 words
 He
 is
 not
 here
 the
 truth
 of
 which
 had
 been
 so
 forcefully
 impressed
 by
 her
 own
 hasty
 glance
 at
 the
 open
 and
 tenantless
 tomb
 Then
 she
 runneth
 and
 cometh
 to
 Simon
 Peter
 and
 to
 the
 other
 disciple
 whom
 Jesus
 loved
 and
 saith
 unto
 them
 They
 have
 taken
 away
 the
 Lord
 out
 of
 the
 sepulchre
 and
 we
 know
 not
 where
 they
 have
 laid
 him
 Peter
 and
 that
 other
 disciple
 who
 doubtless
 was
 John
 set
 forth
 in
 haste
 running
 together
 toward
 the
 sepulchre
 John
 outran
 his
 companion
 and
 on
 reaching
 the
 tomb
 stooped
 to
 look
 in
 and
 so
 caught
 a
 glimpse
 of
 the
 linen
 cerements
 lying
 on
 the
 floor
 but
 the
 bold
 and
 impetuous
 Peter
 rushed
 into
 the
 sepulchre
 and
 was
 followed
 by
 the
 younger
 apostle
 The
 two
 observed
 the
 linen
 graveclothes
 and
 lying
 by
 itself
 the
 napkin
 that
 had
 been
 placed
 about
 the
 head
 of
 the
 corpse
 John
 frankly
 affirms
 that
 having
 seen
 these
 things
 he
 believed
 and
 explains
 in
 behalf
 of
 himself
 and
 his
 fellow
 apostles
 For
 as
 yet
 they
 knew
 not
 the
 scripture
 that
 he
 must
 rise
 again
 from
 the
 dead
 The
 sorrowful
 Magdalene
 had
 followed
 the
 two
 apostles
 back
 to
 the
 garden
 of
 the
 burial
 No
 thought
 of
 the
 Lords
 restoration
 to
 life
 appears
 to
 have
 found
 place
 in
 her
 griefstricken
 heart
 she
 knew
 only
 that
 the
 body
 of
 her
 beloved
 Master
 had
 disappeared
 While
 Peter
 and
 John
 were
 within
 the
 sepulchre
 she
 had
 stood
 without
 weeping
 After
 the
 men
 had
 left
 she
 stooped
 and
 looked
 into
 the
 rockhewn
 cavern
 There
 she
 saw
 two
 personages
 angels
 in
 white
 one
 sat
 at
 the
 head
 and
 the
 other
 at
 the
 feet
 where
 the
 body
 of
 Jesus
 had
 lain
 In
 accents
 of
 tenderness
 they
 asked
 of
 her
 Woman
 why
 weepest
 thou
 In
 reply
 she
 could
 but
 voice
 anew
 her
 overwhelming
 sorrow
 Because
 they
 have
 taken
 away
 my
 Lord
 and
 I
 know
 not
 where
 they
 have
 laid
 him
 The
 absence
 of
 the
 body
 which
 she
 thought
 to
 be
 all
 that
 was
 left
 on
 earth
 of
 Him
 whom
 she
 loved
 so
 deeply
 was
 a
 personal
 bereavement
 There
 is
 a
 volume
 of
 pathos
 and
 affection
 in
 her
 words
 They
 have
 taken
 away
 my
 Lord
 Turning
 from
 the
 vault
 which
 though
 at
 that
 moment
 illumined
 by
 angelic
 presence
 was
 to
 her
 void
 and
 desolate
 she
 became
 aware
 of
 another
 Personage
 standing
 near
 She
 heard
 His
 sympathizing
 inquiry
 Woman
 why
 weepest
 thou
 whom
 seekest
 thou
 Scarcely
 lifting
 her
 tearful
 countenance
 to
 look
 at
 the
 Questioner
 but
 vaguely
 supposing
 that
 He
 was
 the
 caretaker
 of
 the
 garden
 and
 that
 He
 might
 have
 knowledge
 of
 what
 had
 been
 done
 with
 the
 body
 of
 her
 Lord
 she
 exclaimed
 Sir
 if
 thou
 have
 borne
 him
 hence
 tell
 me
 where
 thou
 hast
 laid
 him
 and
 I
 will
 take
 him
 away
 She
 knew
 that
 Jesus
 had
 been
 interred
 in
 a
 borrowed
 tomb
 and
 if
 the
 body
 had
 been
 dispossessed
 of
 that
 resting
 place
 she
 was
 prepared
 to
 provide
 another
 Tell
 me
 where
 thou
 hast
 laid
 him
 she
 pleaded
 It
 was
 Jesus
 to
 whom
 she
 spake
 her
 beloved
 Lord
 though
 she
 knew
 it
 not
 One
 word
 from
 His
 living
 lips
 changed
 her
 agonized
 grief
 into
 ecstatic
 joy
 Jesus
 saith
 unto
 her
 Mary
 The
 voice
 the
 tone
 the
 tender
 accent
 she
 had
 heard
 and
 loved
 in
 the
 earlier
 days
 lifted
 her
 from
 the
 despairing
 depths
 into
 which
 she
 had
 sunk
 She
 turned
 and
 saw
 the
 Lord
 In
 a
 transport
 of
 joy
 she
 reached
 out
 her
 arms
 to
 embrace
 Him
 uttering
 only
 the
 endearing
 and
 worshipful
 word
 Rabboni
 meaning
 My
 beloved
 Master
 Jesus
 restrained
 her
 impulsive
 manifestation
 of
 reverent
 love
 saying
 Touch
 me
 not
 for
 I
 am
 not
 yet
 ascended
 to
 my
 Father
 and
 adding
 but
 go
 to
 my
 brethren
 and
 say
 unto
 them
 I
 ascend
 unto
 my
 Father
 and
 your
 Father
 and
 to
 my
 God
 and
 your
 God
 To
 a
 woman
 to
 Mary
 of
 Magdala
 was
 given
 the
 honor
 of
 being
 the
 first
 among
 mortals
 to
 behold
 a
 resurrected
 Soul
 and
 that
 Soul
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 To
 other
 favored
 women
 did
 the
 risen
 Lord
 next
 manifest
 Himself
 including
 Mary
 the
 mother
 of
 Joses
 Joanna
 and
 Salome
 the
 mother
 of
 the
 apostles
 James
 and
 John
 These
 and
 the
 other
 women
 with
 them
 had
 been
 affrighted
 by
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 angel
 at
 the
 tomb
 and
 had
 departed
 with
 mingled
 fear
 and
 joy
 They
 were
 not
 present
 when
 Peter
 and
 John
 entered
 the
 vault
 nor
 afterward
 when
 the
 Lord
 made
 Himself
 known
 to
 Mary
 Magdalene
 They
 may
 have
 returned
 later
 for
 some
 of
 them
 appear
 to
 have
 entered
 the
 sepulchre
 and
 to
 have
 seen
 that
 the
 Lords
 body
 was
 not
 there
 As
 they
 stood
 wondering
 in
 perplexity
 and
 astonishment
 they
 became
 aware
 of
 the
 presence
 of
 two
 men
 in
 shining
 garments
 and
 as
 the
 women
 bowed
 down
 their
 faces
 to
 the
 earth
 the
 angels
 said
 unto
 them
 Why
 seek
 ye
 the
 living
 among
 the
 dead
 He
 is
 not
 here
 but
 is
 risen
 remember
 how
 he
 spake
 unto
 you
 when
 he
 was
 yet
 in
 Galilee
 saying
 The
 Son
 of
 man
 must
 be
 delivered
 into
 the
 hands
 of
 sinful
 men
 and
 be
 crucified
 and
 the
 third
 day
 rise
 again
 And
 they
 remembered
 his
 words
 As
 they
 were
 returning
 to
 the
 city
 to
 deliver
 the
 message
 to
 the
 disciples
 Jesus
 met
 them
 saying
 All
 hail
 And
 they
 came
 and
 held
 him
 by
 the
 feet
 and
 worshipped
 him
 Then
 said
 Jesus
 unto
 them
 Be
 not
 afraid
 go
 tell
 my
 brethren
 that
 they
 go
 into
 Galilee
 and
 there
 shall
 they
 see
 me
 One
 may
 wonder
 why
 Jesus
 had
 forbidden
 Mary
 Magdalene
 to
 touch
 Him
 and
 then
 so
 soon
 after
 had
 permitted
 other
 women
 to
 hold
 Him
 by
 the
 feet
 as
 they
 bowed
 in
 reverence
 We
 may
 assume
 that
 Marys
 emotional
 approach
 had
 been
 prompted
 more
 by
 a
 feeling
 of
 personal
 yet
 holy
 affection
 than
 by
 an
 impulse
 of
 devotional
 worship
 such
 as
 the
 other
 women
 evinced
 Though
 the
 resurrected
 Christ
 manifested
 the
 same
 friendly
 and
 intimate
 regard
 as
 He
 had
 shown
 in
 the
 mortal
 state
 toward
 those
 with
 whom
 He
 had
 been
 closely
 associated
 He
 was
 no
 longer
 one
 of
 them
 in
 the
 literal
 sense
 There
 was
 about
 Him
 a
 divine
 dignity
 that
 forbade
 close
 personal
 familiarity
 To
 Mary
 Magdalene
 Christ
 had
 said
 Touch
 me
 not
 for
 I
 am
 not
 yet
 ascended
 to
 my
 Father
 If
 the
 second
 clause
 was
 spoken
 in
 explanation
 of
 the
 first
 we
 have
 to
 infer
 that
 no
 human
 hand
 was
 to
 be
 permitted
 to
 touch
 the
 Lords
 resurrected
 and
 immortalized
 body
 until
 after
 He
 had
 presented
 Himself
 to
 the
 Father
 It
 appears
 reasonable
 and
 probable
 that
 between
 Marys
 impulsive
 attempt
 to
 touch
 the
 Lord
 and
 the
 action
 of
 the
 other
 women
 who
 held
 Him
 by
 the
 feet
 as
 they
 bowed
 in
 worshipful
 reverence
 Christ
 did
 ascend
 to
 the
 Father
 and
 that
 later
 He
 returned
 to
 earth
 to
 continue
 His
 ministry
 in
 the
 resurrected
 state
 Mary
 Magdalene
 and
 the
 other
 women
 told
 the
 wonderful
 story
 of
 their
 several
 experiences
 to
 the
 disciples
 but
 the
 brethren
 could
 not
 credit
 their
 words
 which
 seemed
 to
 them
 as
 idle
 tales
 and
 they
 believed
 them
 not
 After
 all
 that
 Christ
 had
 taught
 concerning
 His
 rising
 from
 the
 dead
 on
 that
 third
 day
 the
 apostles
 were
 unable
 to
 accept
 the
 actuality
 of
 the
 occurrence
 to
 their
 minds
 the
 resurrection
 was
 some
 mysterious
 and
 remote
 event
 not
 a
 present
 possibility
 There
 was
 neither
 precedent
 nor
 analogy
 for
 the
 stories
 these
 women
 toldof
 a
 dead
 person
 returning
 to
 life
 with
 a
 body
 of
 flesh
 and
 bones
 such
 as
 could
 be
 seen
 and
 feltexcept
 the
 instances
 of
 the
 young
 man
 of
 Nain
 the
 daughter
 of
 Jairus
 and
 the
 beloved
 Lazarus
 of
 Bethany
 between
 whose
 cases
 of
 restoration
 to
 a
 renewal
 of
 mortal
 life
 and
 the
 reported
 resurrection
 of
 Jesus
 they
 recognized
 essential
 differences
 The
 grief
 and
 the
 sense
 of
 irreparable
 loss
 which
 had
 characterized
 the
 yesterday
 Sabbath
 were
 replaced
 by
 profound
 perplexity
 and
 contending
 doubts
 on
 this
 first
 day
 of
 the
 week
 But
 while
 the
 apostles
 hesitated
 to
 believe
 that
 Christ
 had
 actually
 risen
 the
 women
 less
 skeptical
 more
 trustful
 knew
 for
 they
 had
 both
 seen
 Him
 and
 heard
 His
 voice
 and
 some
 of
 them
 had
 touched
 His
 feet
 A
 PRIESTLY
 CONSPIRACY
 OF
 FALSEHOOD
 When
 the
 Roman
 guardsmen
 had
 sufficiently
 recovered
 from
 fright
 to
 make
 their
 precipitate
 departure
 from
 the
 sepulchre
 they
 went
 to
 the
 chief
 priests
 under
 whose
 orders
 they
 had
 been
 placed
 by
 Pilate
 and
 reported
 the
 supernatural
 occurrences
 they
 had
 witnessed
 The
 chief
 priests
 were
 Sadducees
 of
 which
 sect
 or
 party
 a
 distinguishing
 feature
 was
 the
 denial
 of
 the
 possibility
 of
 resurrection
 from
 the
 dead
 A
 session
 of
 the
 Sanhedrin
 was
 called
 and
 the
 disturbing
 report
 of
 the
 guard
 was
 considered
 In
 the
 spirit
 in
 which
 these
 deceiving
 hierarchs
 had
 tried
 to
 kill
 Lazarus
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 quelling
 popular
 interest
 in
 the
 miracle
 of
 his
 restoration
 to
 life
 they
 now
 conspired
 to
 discredit
 the
 truth
 of
 Christs
 resurrection
 by
 bribing
 the
 soldiers
 to
 lie
 These
 were
 told
 to
 say
 His
 disciples
 came
 by
 night
 and
 stole
 him
 away
 while
 we
 slept
 and
 for
 the
 falsehood
 they
 were
 offered
 large
 sums
 of
 money
 The
 soldiers
 accepted
 the
 tempting
 bribe
 and
 did
 as
 they
 were
 instructed
 for
 this
 course
 appeared
 to
 them
 the
 best
 way
 out
 of
 a
 critical
 situation
 If
 they
 were
 found
 guilty
 of
 sleeping
 at
 their
 posts
 immediate
 death
 would
 be
 their
 doom
 but
 the
 Jews
 encouraged
 them
 by
 the
 promise
 If
 this
 come
 to
 the
 governors
 ears
 we
 will
 persuade
 him
 and
 secure
 you
 It
 must
 be
 remembered
 that
 the
 soldiers
 had
 been
 put
 at
 the
 disposal
 of
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 presumably
 therefore
 were
 not
 required
 to
 report
 the
 details
 of
 their
 doings
 to
 the
 Roman
 authorities
 The
 recorder
 adds
 that
 until
 the
 day
 of
 his
 writing
 the
 falsehood
 of
 Christs
 body
 having
 been
 stolen
 from
 the
 tomb
 by
 the
 disciples
 was
 current
 among
 the
 Jews
 The
 utter
 untenability
 of
 the
 false
 report
 is
 apparent
 If
 all
 the
 soldiers
 were
 asleepa
 most
 unlikely
 occurrence
 inasmuch
 as
 such
 neglect
 was
 a
 capital
 offensehow
 could
 they
 possibly
 know
 that
 any
 one
 had
 approached
 the
 tomb
 And
 more
 particularly
 how
 could
 they
 substantiate
 their
 statement
 even
 if
 it
 were
 true
 that
 the
 body
 was
 stolen
 and
 that
 the
 disciples
 were
 the
 graverobbers
 The
 mendacious
 fiction
 was
 framed
 by
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 elders
 of
 the
 people
 Not
 all
 the
 priestly
 circle
 were
 parties
 to
 it
 however
 Some
 who
 perhaps
 had
 been
 among
 the
 secret
 disciples
 of
 Jesus
 before
 His
 death
 were
 not
 afraid
 to
 openly
 ally
 themselves
 with
 the
 Church
 when
 through
 the
 evidence
 of
 the
 Lords
 resurrection
 they
 had
 become
 thoroughly
 converted
 We
 read
 that
 but
 a
 few
 months
 later
 a
 great
 company
 of
 the
 priests
 were
 obedient
 to
 the
 faith
 CHRIST
 WALKS
 AND
 TALKS
 WITH
 TWO
 OF
 THE
 DISCIPLES
 During
 the
 afternoon
 of
 that
 same
 Sunday
 two
 disciples
 not
 of
 the
 apostles
 left
 the
 little
 band
 of
 believers
 in
 Jerusalem
 and
 set
 out
 for
 Emmaus
 a
 village
 between
 seven
 and
 eight
 miles
 from
 the
 city
 There
 could
 be
 but
 one
 topic
 of
 conversation
 between
 them
 and
 on
 this
 they
 communed
 as
 they
 walked
 citing
 incidents
 in
 the
 Lords
 life
 dwelling
 particularly
 upon
 the
 fact
 of
 His
 death
 through
 which
 their
 hopes
 of
 a
 Messianic
 reign
 had
 been
 so
 sadly
 blighted
 and
 marveling
 deeply
 over
 the
 incomprehensible
 testimony
 of
 the
 women
 concerning
 His
 reappearance
 as
 a
 living
 Soul
 As
 they
 went
 engrossed
 in
 sorrowful
 and
 profound
 discourse
 another
 Wayfarer
 joined
 them
 it
 was
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 but
 their
 eyes
 were
 holden
 that
 they
 should
 not
 know
 him
 In
 courteous
 interest
 He
 asked
 What
 manner
 of
 communications
 are
 these
 that
 ye
 have
 one
 to
 another
 as
 ye
 walk
 and
 are
 sad
 One
 of
 the
 disciples
 Cleopas
 by
 name
 replied
 with
 surprize
 tinged
 with
 commiseration
 for
 the
 Strangers
 seeming
 ignorance
 Art
 thou
 only
 a
 stranger
 in
 Jerusalem
 and
 hast
 not
 known
 the
 things
 which
 are
 come
 to
 pass
 there
 in
 these
 days
 Intent
 on
 drawing
 from
 the
 men
 a
 full
 statement
 of
 the
 matter
 by
 which
 they
 were
 so
 plainly
 agitated
 the
 unrecognized
 Christ
 asked
 What
 things
 They
 could
 not
 be
 reticent
 Concerning
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 they
 explained
 which
 was
 a
 prophet
 mighty
 in
 deed
 and
 word
 before
 God
 and
 all
 the
 people
 and
 how
 the
 chief
 priests
 and
 our
 rulers
 delivered
 him
 to
 be
 condemned
 to
 death
 and
 have
 crucified
 him
 In
 sorrowful
 mood
 they
 went
 on
 to
 tell
 how
 they
 had
 trusted
 that
 the
 now
 crucified
 Jesus
 would
 have
 proved
 to
 be
 the
 Messiah
 sent
 to
 redeem
 Israel
 but
 alas
 this
 was
 the
 third
 day
 since
 He
 had
 been
 slain
 Then
 with
 brightening
 countenances
 yet
 still
 perplexed
 they
 told
 of
 certain
 women
 of
 their
 company
 who
 had
 astonished
 them
 that
 morning
 by
 saying
 that
 they
 had
 visited
 the
 sepulchre
 early
 and
 had
 discovered
 that
 the
 Lords
 body
 was
 not
 there
 but
 that
 they
 had
 also
 seen
 a
 vision
 of
 angels
 which
 said
 that
 he
 was
 alive
 Moreover
 others
 beside
 the
 women
 had
 gone
 to
 the
 tomb
 and
 had
 verified
 the
 absence
 of
 the
 body
 but
 had
 not
 seen
 the
 Lord
 Then
 Jesus
 gently
 chiding
 His
 fellow
 travelers
 as
 foolish
 men
 and
 slow
 of
 heart
 in
 their
 hesitating
 acceptance
 of
 what
 the
 prophets
 had
 spoken
 asked
 impressively
 Ought
 not
 Christ
 to
 have
 suffered
 these
 things
 and
 to
 enter
 into
 his
 glory
 Beginning
 with
 the
 inspired
 predictions
 of
 Moses
 He
 expounded
 to
 them
 the
 scriptures
 touching
 upon
 all
 the
 prophetic
 utterances
 concerning
 the
 Saviors
 mission
 Having
 continued
 with
 the
 two
 men
 to
 their
 destination
 Jesus
 made
 as
 though
 he
 would
 have
 gone
 further
 but
 they
 urged
 Him
 to
 tarry
 with
 them
 for
 the
 day
 was
 already
 far
 spent
 He
 so
 far
 acceded
 to
 their
 hospitable
 entreaty
 as
 to
 enter
 the
 house
 and
 as
 soon
 as
 their
 simple
 meal
 was
 prepared
 to
 seat
 Himself
 with
 them
 at
 the
 table
 As
 the
 Guest
 of
 honor
 He
 took
 the
 loaf
 blessed
 it
 and
 brake
 and
 gave
 to
 them
 There
 may
 have
 been
 something
 in
 the
 fervency
 of
 the
 blessing
 or
 in
 the
 manner
 of
 breaking
 and
 distributing
 the
 bread
 that
 revived
 memories
 of
 former
 days
 or
 possibly
 they
 caught
 sight
 of
 the
 pierced
 hands
 but
 whatever
 the
 immediate
 cause
 they
 looked
 intently
 upon
 their
 Guest
 and
 their
 eyes
 were
 opened
 and
 they
 knew
 him
 and
 he
 vanished
 out
 of
 their
 sight
 In
 a
 fulness
 of
 joyful
 wonderment
 they
 rose
 from
 the
 table
 surprized
 at
 themselves
 for
 not
 having
 recognized
 Him
 sooner
 One
 said
 to
 the
 other
 Did
 not
 our
 heart
 burn
 within
 us
 while
 he
 talked
 with
 us
 by
 the
 way
 and
 while
 he
 opened
 to
 us
 the
 scriptures
 Straightway
 they
 started
 to
 retrace
 their
 steps
 and
 hastened
 back
 to
 Jerusalem
 to
 confirm
 by
 their
 witness
 what
 before
 the
 brethren
 had
 been
 slow
 to
 believe
 RISEN
 LORD
 APPEARS
 TO
 THE
 DISCIPLES
 IN
 JERUSALEM
 AND
 EATS
 IN
 THEIR
 PRESENCE
 When
 Cleopas
 and
 his
 companion
 reached
 Jerusalem
 that
 night
 they
 found
 the
 apostles
 and
 other
 devoted
 believers
 assembled
 in
 solemn
 and
 worshipful
 discourse
 within
 closed
 doors
 Precautions
 of
 secrecy
 had
 been
 taken
 for
 fear
 of
 the
 Jews
 Even
 the
 apostles
 had
 been
 scattered
 by
 the
 arrest
 arraignment
 and
 judicial
 murder
 of
 their
 Master
 but
 they
 and
 the
 disciples
 in
 general
 rallied
 anew
 at
 the
 word
 of
 His
 resurrection
 as
 the
 nucleus
 of
 an
 army
 soon
 to
 sweep
 the
 world
 The
 two
 returning
 disciples
 were
 received
 with
 the
 joyous
 announcement
 The
 Lord
 is
 risen
 indeed
 and
 hath
 appeared
 to
 Simon
 This
 is
 the
 sole
 mention
 made
 by
 the
 Gospelwriters
 of
 Christs
 personal
 appearance
 to
 Simon
 Peter
 on
 that
 day
 The
 interview
 between
 the
 Lord
 and
 His
 once
 recreant
 but
 now
 repentant
 apostle
 must
 have
 been
 affecting
 in
 the
 extreme
 Peters
 remorseful
 penitence
 over
 his
 denial
 of
 Christ
 in
 the
 palace
 of
 the
 high
 priest
 was
 deep
 and
 pitiful
 he
 may
 have
 doubted
 that
 ever
 again
 would
 the
 Master
 call
 him
 His
 servant
 but
 hope
 must
 have
 been
 engendered
 through
 the
 message
 from
 the
 tomb
 brought
 by
 the
 women
 in
 which
 the
 Lord
 sent
 greetings
 to
 the
 apostles
 whom
 for
 the
 first
 time
 He
 designated
 as
 His
 brethren
 and
 from
 this
 honorable
 and
 affectionate
 characterization
 Peter
 had
 not
 been
 excluded
 moreover
 the
 angels
 commission
 to
 the
 women
 had
 given
 prominence
 to
 Peter
 by
 particular
 mention
 To
 the
 repentant
 Peter
 came
 the
 Lord
 doubtless
 with
 forgiveness
 and
 loving
 assurance
 The
 apostle
 himself
 maintains
 a
 reverent
 silence
 respecting
 the
 visitation
 but
 the
 fact
 thereof
 is
 attested
 by
 Paul
 as
 one
 of
 the
 definite
 proofs
 of
 the
 Lords
 resurrection
 Following
 the
 jubilant
 testimony
 of
 the
 assembled
 believers
 Cleopas
 and
 his
 fellow
 traveler
 told
 of
 the
 Lords
 companionship
 with
 them
 on
 the
 Emmaus
 road
 of
 the
 things
 He
 had
 taught
 them
 and
 of
 the
 manner
 in
 which
 He
 had
 become
 known
 unto
 them
 in
 the
 breaking
 of
 bread
 As
 the
 little
 company
 communed
 together
 Jesus
 himself
 stood
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 them
 and
 saith
 unto
 them
 Peace
 be
 unto
 you
 They
 were
 affrighted
 supposing
 with
 superstitious
 dread
 that
 a
 ghost
 had
 intruded
 amongst
 them
 But
 the
 Lord
 comforted
 them
 saying
 Why
 are
 ye
 troubled
 and
 why
 do
 thoughts
 arise
 in
 your
 hearts
 Behold
 my
 hands
 and
 my
 feet
 that
 it
 is
 I
 myself
 handle
 me
 and
 see
 for
 a
 spirit
 hath
 not
 flesh
 and
 bones
 as
 ye
 see
 me
 have
 Then
 He
 showed
 them
 the
 wounds
 in
 His
 hands
 and
 feet
 and
 side
 They
 yet
 believed
 not
 for
 joy
 which
 is
 to
 say
 they
 thought
 the
 reality
 to
 which
 they
 all
 were
 witnesses
 too
 good
 too
 glorious
 to
 be
 true
 To
 further
 assure
 them
 that
 He
 was
 no
 shadowy
 form
 no
 immaterial
 being
 of
 tenuous
 substance
 but
 a
 living
 Personage
 with
 bodily
 organs
 internal
 as
 well
 as
 outward
 He
 asked
 Have
 ye
 here
 any
 meat
 They
 gave
 Him
 a
 piece
 of
 a
 broiled
 fish
 and
 other
 food
 which
 He
 took
 and
 did
 eat
 before
 them
 These
 unquestionable
 evidences
 of
 their
 Visitants
 corporeity
 calmed
 and
 made
 rational
 the
 minds
 of
 the
 disciples
 and
 now
 that
 they
 were
 composed
 and
 receptive
 the
 Lord
 reminded
 them
 that
 all
 things
 that
 had
 happened
 to
 Him
 were
 in
 accordance
 with
 what
 He
 had
 told
 them
 while
 He
 had
 lived
 amongst
 them
 In
 His
 divine
 presence
 their
 understanding
 was
 quickened
 and
 enlarged
 so
 that
 they
 comprehended
 as
 never
 before
 the
 scripturesthe
 Law
 of
 Moses
 the
 books
 of
 the
 prophets
 and
 the
 psalmsconcerning
 Him
 That
 His
 now
 accomplished
 death
 was
 a
 necessity
 He
 attested
 as
 fully
 as
 He
 had
 predicted
 and
 affirmed
 the
 same
 aforetime
 Then
 He
 said
 unto
 them
 Thus
 it
 is
 written
 and
 thus
 it
 behoved
 Christ
 to
 suffer
 and
 to
 rise
 from
 the
 dead
 the
 third
 day
 and
 that
 repentance
 and
 remission
 of
 sins
 should
 be
 preached
 in
 his
 name
 among
 all
 nations
 beginning
 at
 Jerusalem
 And
 ye
 are
 witnesses
 of
 these
 things
 Then
 were
 the
 disciples
 glad
 As
 He
 was
 about
 to
 depart
 the
 Lord
 gave
 them
 His
 blessing
 saying
 Peace
 be
 unto
 you
 as
 my
 Father
 hath
 sent
 me
 even
 so
 send
 I
 you
 This
 specification
 of
 men
 sent
 by
 authority
 points
 directly
 to
 the
 apostles
 And
 when
 he
 had
 said
 this
 he
 breathed
 on
 them
 and
 saith
 unto
 them
 Receive
 ye
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 whose
 soever
 sins
 ye
 remit
 they
 are
 remitted
 unto
 them
 and
 whose
 soever
 sins
 ye
 retain
 they
 are
 retained
 DOUBTING
 THOMAS
 When
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 appeared
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 disciples
 on
 the
 evening
 of
 the
 Resurrection
 Sunday
 one
 of
 the
 apostles
 Thomas
 was
 absent
 He
 was
 informed
 of
 what
 the
 others
 had
 witnessed
 but
 was
 unconvinced
 even
 their
 solemn
 testimony
 We
 have
 seen
 the
 Lord
 failed
 to
 awaken
 an
 echo
 of
 faith
 in
 his
 heart
 In
 his
 state
 of
 mental
 skepticism
 he
 exclaimed
 Except
 I
 shall
 see
 in
 his
 hands
 the
 print
 of
 the
 nails
 and
 put
 my
 finger
 into
 the
 print
 of
 the
 nails
 and
 thrust
 my
 hand
 into
 his
 side
 I
 will
 not
 believe
 Caution
 and
 charity
 must
 attend
 our
 judgment
 in
 any
 conclusion
 as
 to
 the
 incredulous
 attitude
 of
 this
 man
 He
 could
 scarcely
 have
 doubted
 the
 well
 attested
 circumstance
 of
 the
 empty
 sepulchre
 nor
 the
 veracity
 of
 Mary
 Magdalene
 and
 the
 other
 women
 as
 to
 the
 presence
 of
 angels
 and
 the
 Lords
 appearing
 nor
 Peters
 testimony
 nor
 that
 of
 the
 assembled
 company
 but
 he
 may
 have
 regarded
 the
 reported
 manifestations
 as
 a
 series
 of
 subjective
 visions
 and
 the
 absence
 of
 the
 Lords
 body
 may
 have
 been
 vaguely
 considered
 as
 a
 result
 of
 Christs
 supernatural
 restoration
 to
 life
 followed
 by
 a
 bodily
 and
 final
 departure
 from
 earth
 It
 was
 the
 corporeal
 manifestation
 of
 the
 risen
 Lord
 the
 exhibition
 of
 the
 wounds
 incident
 to
 crucifixion
 the
 invitation
 to
 touch
 and
 feel
 the
 resurrected
 body
 of
 flesh
 and
 bones
 to
 which
 Thomas
 demurred
 He
 had
 no
 such
 definite
 conception
 of
 the
 resurrection
 as
 would
 accord
 with
 a
 literal
 acceptance
 of
 the
 testimony
 of
 his
 brethren
 and
 sisters
 who
 had
 seen
 heard
 and
 felt
 A
 week
 later
 for
 so
 the
 Jewish
 designation
 after
 eight
 days
 is
 to
 be
 understood
 therefore
 on
 the
 next
 Sunday
 which
 day
 of
 the
 week
 afterward
 came
 to
 be
 known
 to
 the
 Church
 as
 the
 Lords
 Day
 and
 to
 be
 observed
 as
 the
 Sabbath
 in
 place
 of
 Saturday
 the
 Mosaic
 Sabbath
 the
 disciples
 were
 again
 assembled
 and
 Thomas
 was
 with
 them
 The
 meeting
 was
 held
 within
 closed
 and
 presumably
 guarded
 doors
 for
 there
 was
 danger
 of
 interference
 by
 the
 Jewish
 officers
 Then
 came
 Jesus
 the
 doors
 being
 shut
 and
 stood
 in
 the
 midst
 and
 said
 Peace
 be
 unto
 you
 Then
 saith
 he
 to
 Thomas
 Reach
 hither
 thy
 finger
 and
 behold
 my
 hands
 and
 reach
 hither
 thy
 hand
 and
 thrust
 it
 into
 my
 side
 and
 be
 not
 faithless
 but
 believing
 The
 skeptical
 mind
 of
 Thomas
 was
 instantly
 cleansed
 his
 doubting
 heart
 was
 purified
 and
 a
 conviction
 of
 the
 glorious
 truth
 flooded
 his
 soul
 In
 contrite
 reverence
 he
 bowed
 before
 his
 Savior
 the
 while
 exclaiming
 in
 worshipful
 acknowledgment
 of
 Christs
 Deity
 My
 Lord
 and
 my
 God
 His
 adoration
 was
 accepted
 and
 the
 Savior
 said
 Thomas
 because
 thou
 hast
 seen
 me
 thou
 hast
 believed
 blessed
 are
 they
 that
 have
 not
 seen
 and
 yet
 have
 believed
 AT
 THE
 SEA
 OF
 GALILEE
 The
 angel
 at
 the
 sepulchre
 and
 the
 risen
 Christ
 Himself
 had
 severally
 sent
 word
 to
 the
 apostles
 to
 go
 into
 Galilee
 where
 the
 Lord
 would
 meet
 them
 as
 He
 had
 said
 before
 His
 death
 They
 deferred
 their
 departure
 until
 after
 the
 week
 following
 the
 resurrection
 and
 then
 once
 again
 in
 their
 native
 province
 they
 awaited
 further
 developments
 In
 the
 afternoon
 of
 one
 of
 those
 days
 of
 waiting
 Peter
 said
 to
 six
 of
 his
 fellow
 apostles
 I
 go
 a
 fishing
 and
 the
 others
 replied
 We
 also
 go
 with
 thee
 Without
 delay
 they
 embarked
 on
 a
 fishing
 boat
 and
 though
 they
 toiled
 through
 the
 night
 the
 net
 had
 been
 drawn
 in
 empty
 after
 every
 cast
 As
 morning
 approached
 they
 drew
 near
 the
 land
 disappointed
 and
 disheartened
 In
 the
 early
 dawn
 they
 were
 hailed
 from
 the
 shore
 by
 One
 who
 asked
 Children
 have
 ye
 any
 meat
 They
 answered
 No
 It
 was
 Jesus
 who
 made
 the
 inquiry
 though
 none
 in
 the
 boat
 recognized
 Him
 He
 called
 to
 them
 again
 saying
 Cast
 the
 net
 on
 the
 right
 side
 of
 the
 ship
 and
 ye
 shall
 find
 They
 cast
 therefore
 and
 now
 they
 were
 not
 able
 to
 draw
 it
 for
 the
 multitude
 of
 fishes
 They
 did
 as
 directed
 and
 the
 result
 was
 so
 surprizing
 as
 to
 appear
 to
 them
 miraculous
 it
 must
 have
 aroused
 memories
 of
 that
 other
 remarkable
 draught
 of
 fishes
 in
 the
 taking
 of
 which
 their
 fishermens
 skill
 had
 been
 superseded
 and
 at
 least
 three
 witnesses
 of
 the
 earlier
 miracle
 were
 now
 in
 the
 boat
 John
 quick
 to
 discern
 said
 to
 Peter
 It
 is
 the
 Lord
 and
 Peter
 impulsive
 as
 ever
 hastily
 girt
 his
 fishers
 coat
 about
 him
 and
 sprang
 into
 the
 sea
 the
 sooner
 to
 reach
 land
 and
 prostrate
 himself
 at
 his
 Masters
 feet
 The
 others
 left
 the
 vessel
 and
 entered
 a
 small
 boat
 in
 which
 they
 rowed
 to
 shore
 towing
 the
 heavily
 laden
 net
 On
 the
 land
 they
 saw
 a
 fire
 of
 coals
 with
 fish
 broiling
 thereon
 and
 alongside
 a
 supply
 of
 bread
 Jesus
 told
 them
 to
 bring
 of
 the
 fish
 they
 had
 just
 caught
 to
 which
 instruction
 the
 stalwart
 Peter
 responded
 by
 dashing
 into
 the
 shallows
 and
 dragging
 the
 net
 to
 shore
 When
 counted
 the
 haul
 was
 found
 to
 consist
 of
 a
 hundred
 and
 fiftythree
 great
 fishes
 and
 the
 narrator
 is
 careful
 to
 note
 that
 for
 all
 there
 were
 so
 many
 yet
 was
 not
 the
 net
 broken
 Then
 Jesus
 said
 Come
 and
 dine
 and
 as
 the
 Host
 at
 the
 meal
 He
 divided
 and
 distributed
 the
 bread
 and
 fish
 We
 are
 not
 told
 that
 He
 ate
 with
 His
 guests
 Everyone
 knew
 that
 it
 was
 the
 Lord
 who
 so
 hospitably
 served
 yet
 on
 this
 as
 on
 all
 other
 occasions
 of
 His
 appearing
 in
 the
 resurrected
 state
 there
 was
 about
 Him
 an
 aweinspiring
 and
 restraining
 demeanor
 They
 would
 have
 liked
 to
 question
 Him
 but
 durst
 not
 John
 tells
 us
 that
 this
 was
 the
 third
 time
 that
 Jesus
 shewed
 himself
 to
 his
 disciples
 after
 that
 he
 was
 risen
 from
 the
 dead
 by
 which
 we
 understand
 the
 occasion
 to
 have
 been
 the
 third
 on
 which
 Christ
 had
 manifested
 Himself
 to
 the
 apostles
 in
 complete
 or
 partial
 assembly
 for
 including
 also
 the
 appearing
 to
 Mary
 Magdalene
 to
 the
 other
 women
 to
 Peter
 and
 to
 the
 two
 disciples
 on
 the
 country
 road
 this
 was
 the
 seventh
 recorded
 appearance
 of
 the
 risen
 Lord
 When
 the
 meal
 was
 finished
 Jesus
 saith
 to
 Simon
 Peter
 Simon
 son
 of
 Jonas
 lovest
 thou
 me
 more
 than
 these
 The
 question
 however
 tenderly
 put
 must
 have
 wrung
 Peters
 heart
 coupled
 as
 it
 was
 with
 the
 reminder
 of
 his
 bold
 but
 undependable
 protestation
 Though
 all
 men
 shall
 be
 offended
 because
 of
 thee
 yet
 will
 I
 never
 be
 offended
 followed
 by
 his
 denial
 that
 he
 had
 ever
 known
 the
 Man
 To
 the
 Lords
 inquiry
 Peter
 answered
 humbly
 Yea
 Lord
 thou
 knowest
 that
 I
 love
 thee
 Then
 said
 Jesus
 Feed
 my
 lambs
 The
 question
 was
 repeated
 and
 Peter
 replied
 in
 identical
 words
 to
 which
 the
 Lord
 responded
 Feed
 my
 sheep
 And
 yet
 the
 third
 time
 Jesus
 asked
 Simon
 son
 of
 Jonas
 lovest
 thou
 me
 Peter
 was
 pained
 and
 grieved
 at
 this
 reiteration
 thinking
 perhaps
 that
 the
 Lord
 mistrusted
 him
 but
 as
 the
 man
 had
 three
 times
 denied
 so
 now
 was
 he
 given
 opportunity
 for
 a
 triple
 confession
 To
 the
 thrice
 repeated
 question
 Peter
 answered
 Lord
 thou
 knowest
 all
 things
 thou
 knowest
 that
 I
 love
 thee
 Jesus
 saith
 unto
 him
 Feed
 my
 sheep
 The
 commission
 Feed
 my
 sheep
 was
 an
 assurance
 of
 the
 Lords
 confidence
 and
 of
 the
 reality
 of
 Peters
 presidency
 among
 the
 apostles
 He
 had
 emphatically
 announced
 his
 readiness
 to
 follow
 his
 Master
 even
 to
 prison
 and
 death
 Now
 the
 Lord
 who
 had
 died
 said
 unto
 him
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 thee
 When
 thou
 wast
 young
 thou
 girdest
 thyself
 and
 walkedst
 whither
 thou
 wouldst
 but
 when
 thou
 shalt
 be
 old
 thou
 shalt
 stretch
 forth
 thy
 hands
 and
 another
 shall
 gird
 thee
 and
 carry
 thee
 whither
 thou
 wouldst
 not
 John
 informs
 us
 that
 the
 Lord
 so
 spake
 signifying
 the
 death
 by
 which
 Peter
 should
 find
 a
 place
 among
 the
 martyrs
 the
 analogy
 points
 to
 crucifixion
 and
 traditional
 history
 is
 without
 contradiction
 as
 to
 this
 being
 the
 death
 by
 which
 Peter
 sealed
 his
 testimony
 of
 the
 Christ
 Then
 said
 the
 Lord
 to
 Peter
 Follow
 me
 The
 command
 had
 both
 immediate
 and
 future
 significance
 The
 man
 followed
 as
 Jesus
 drew
 apart
 from
 the
 others
 on
 the
 shore
 yet
 a
 few
 years
 and
 Peter
 would
 follow
 his
 Lord
 to
 the
 cross
 Without
 doubt
 Peter
 comprehended
 the
 reference
 to
 his
 martyrdom
 as
 his
 writings
 years
 later
 indicate
 As
 Christ
 and
 Peter
 walked
 together
 the
 latter
 looking
 backward
 saw
 that
 John
 was
 following
 and
 inquired
 Lord
 and
 what
 shall
 this
 man
 do
 Peter
 wished
 to
 peer
 into
 the
 future
 as
 to
 his
 companions
 fatewas
 John
 also
 to
 die
 for
 the
 faith
 The
 Lord
 replied
 If
 I
 will
 that
 he
 tarry
 till
 I
 come
 what
 is
 that
 to
 thee
 follow
 thou
 me
 It
 was
 an
 admonition
 to
 Peter
 to
 look
 to
 his
 own
 course
 of
 duty
 and
 to
 follow
 the
 Master
 wherever
 the
 road
 should
 lead
 Concerning
 himself
 John
 adds
 Then
 went
 this
 saying
 abroad
 among
 the
 brethren
 that
 that
 disciple
 should
 not
 die
 yet
 Jesus
 said
 not
 unto
 him
 He
 shall
 not
 die
 but
 If
 I
 will
 that
 he
 tarry
 till
 I
 come
 what
 is
 that
 to
 thee
 That
 John
 still
 lives
 in
 the
 embodied
 state
 and
 shall
 remain
 in
 the
 flesh
 until
 the
 Lords
 yet
 future
 advent
 is
 attested
 by
 later
 revelation
 In
 company
 with
 his
 martyred
 and
 resurrected
 companions
 Peter
 and
 James
 the
 disciple
 whom
 Jesus
 loved
 has
 officiated
 in
 the
 restoration
 of
 the
 Holy
 Apostleship
 in
 this
 the
 dispensation
 of
 the
 fulness
 of
 times
 OTHER
 MANIFESTATIONS
 OF
 THE
 RISEN
 LORD
 IN
 GALILEE
 Jesus
 had
 designated
 a
 mountain
 in
 Galilee
 whereon
 He
 would
 meet
 the
 apostles
 and
 thither
 the
 Eleven
 went
 When
 they
 saw
 Him
 at
 the
 appointed
 place
 they
 worshiped
 Him
 The
 record
 adds
 but
 some
 doubted
 by
 which
 may
 be
 implied
 that
 others
 beside
 the
 apostles
 were
 present
 among
 whom
 were
 some
 who
 were
 unconvinced
 of
 the
 actual
 corporeity
 of
 the
 resurrected
 Christ
 This
 occasion
 may
 have
 been
 that
 of
 which
 Paul
 wrote
 a
 quarter
 of
 a
 century
 later
 concerning
 which
 he
 affirms
 that
 Christ
 was
 seen
 of
 above
 five
 hundred
 brethren
 at
 once
 of
 whom
 though
 some
 had
 died
 the
 majority
 remained
 at
 the
 time
 of
 Pauls
 writing
 living
 witnesses
 to
 his
 testimony
 To
 those
 assembled
 on
 the
 mount
 Jesus
 declared
 All
 power
 is
 given
 unto
 me
 in
 heaven
 and
 in
 earth
 This
 could
 be
 understood
 as
 nothing
 less
 than
 an
 affirmation
 of
 His
 absolute
 Godship
 His
 authority
 was
 supreme
 and
 those
 who
 were
 commissioned
 of
 Him
 were
 to
 minister
 in
 His
 name
 and
 by
 a
 power
 such
 as
 no
 man
 could
 give
 or
 take
 away
 FINAL
 COMMISSION
 AND
 THE
 ASCENSION
 Throughout
 the
 forty
 days
 following
 His
 resurrection
 the
 Lord
 manifested
 Himself
 at
 intervals
 to
 the
 apostles
 to
 some
 individually
 and
 to
 all
 as
 a
 body
 and
 instructed
 them
 in
 the
 things
 pertaining
 to
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 The
 record
 is
 not
 always
 specific
 and
 definite
 as
 to
 time
 and
 place
 of
 particular
 events
 but
 as
 to
 the
 purport
 of
 the
 Lords
 instructions
 during
 this
 period
 there
 exists
 no
 cause
 for
 doubt
 Much
 that
 He
 said
 and
 did
 is
 not
 written
 but
 such
 things
 as
 are
 of
 record
 John
 assures
 his
 readers
 are
 written
 that
 ye
 might
 believe
 that
 Jesus
 is
 the
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 and
 that
 believing
 ye
 might
 have
 life
 through
 his
 name
 As
 the
 time
 of
 His
 ascension
 drew
 nigh
 the
 Lord
 said
 unto
 the
 eleven
 apostles
 Go
 ye
 into
 all
 the
 world
 and
 preach
 the
 gospel
 to
 every
 creature
 He
 that
 believeth
 and
 is
 baptized
 shall
 be
 saved
 but
 he
 that
 believeth
 not
 shall
 be
 damned
 And
 these
 signs
 shall
 follow
 them
 that
 believe
 In
 my
 name
 shall
 they
 cast
 out
 devils
 they
 shall
 speak
 with
 new
 tongues
 they
 shall
 take
 up
 serpents
 and
 if
 they
 drink
 any
 deadly
 thing
 it
 shall
 not
 hurt
 them
 they
 shall
 lay
 hands
 on
 the
 sick
 and
 they
 shall
 recover
 In
 contrast
 with
 their
 earlier
 commission
 under
 which
 they
 were
 sent
 only
 to
 the
 lost
 sheep
 of
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 they
 were
 now
 to
 go
 to
 Jew
 and
 Gentile
 bond
 and
 free
 to
 mankind
 at
 large
 of
 whatever
 nation
 country
 or
 tongue
 Salvation
 through
 faith
 in
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 followed
 by
 repentance
 and
 baptism
 was
 to
 be
 freely
 offered
 to
 all
 the
 rejection
 of
 the
 offer
 thenceforth
 would
 bring
 condemnation
 Signs
 and
 miracles
 were
 promised
 to
 follow
 them
 that
 believe
 thus
 confirming
 their
 faith
 in
 the
 power
 divine
 but
 no
 intimation
 was
 given
 that
 such
 manifestations
 were
 to
 precede
 belief
 as
 baits
 to
 catch
 the
 credulous
 wonderseeker
 Assuring
 the
 apostles
 anew
 that
 the
 promise
 of
 the
 Father
 would
 be
 realized
 in
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 the
 Lord
 instructed
 them
 to
 remain
 in
 Jerusalem
 whither
 they
 had
 now
 returned
 from
 Galilee
 until
 they
 would
 be
 endued
 with
 power
 from
 on
 high
 and
 He
 added
 For
 John
 truly
 baptized
 with
 water
 but
 ye
 shall
 be
 baptized
 with
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 not
 many
 days
 hence
 In
 that
 last
 solemn
 interview
 probably
 as
 the
 risen
 Savior
 led
 the
 mortal
 Eleven
 away
 from
 the
 city
 toward
 the
 old
 familiar
 resort
 on
 the
 Mount
 of
 Olives
 the
 brethren
 still
 imbued
 with
 their
 conception
 of
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 as
 an
 earthly
 establishment
 of
 power
 and
 dominion
 asked
 of
 Him
 Lord
 wilt
 thou
 at
 this
 time
 restore
 again
 the
 kingdom
 to
 Israel
 Jesus
 answered
 It
 is
 not
 for
 you
 to
 know
 the
 times
 or
 the
 seasons
 which
 the
 Father
 hath
 put
 in
 his
 own
 power
 But
 ye
 shall
 receive
 power
 after
 that
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 is
 come
 upon
 you
 and
 ye
 shall
 be
 witnesses
 unto
 me
 both
 in
 Jerusalem
 and
 in
 all
 Judea
 and
 in
 Samaria
 and
 unto
 the
 uttermost
 part
 of
 the
 earth
 Their
 duty
 was
 thus
 defined
 and
 emphasized
 Go
 ye
 therefore
 and
 teach
 all
 nations
 baptizing
 them
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Father
 and
 of
 the
 Son
 and
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 teaching
 them
 to
 observe
 all
 things
 whatsoever
 I
 have
 commanded
 you
 and
 lo
 I
 am
 with
 you
 alway
 even
 unto
 the
 end
 of
 the
 world
 Amen
 When
 Christ
 and
 the
 disciples
 had
 gone
 as
 far
 as
 to
 Bethany
 the
 Lord
 lifted
 up
 His
 hands
 and
 blessed
 them
 and
 while
 yet
 He
 spake
 He
 rose
 from
 their
 midst
 and
 they
 looked
 upon
 Him
 as
 He
 ascended
 until
 a
 cloud
 received
 Him
 out
 of
 their
 sight
 While
 the
 apostles
 stood
 gazing
 steadfastly
 upward
 two
 personages
 clothed
 in
 white
 apparel
 appeared
 by
 them
 these
 spake
 unto
 the
 Eleven
 saying
 Ye
 men
 of
 Galilee
 why
 stand
 ye
 gazing
 up
 into
 heaven
 this
 same
 Jesus
 which
 is
 taken
 up
 from
 you
 into
 heaven
 shall
 so
 come
 in
 like
 manner
 as
 ye
 have
 seen
 him
 go
 into
 heaven
 Worshipfully
 and
 with
 great
 joy
 the
 apostles
 returned
 to
 Jerusalem
 there
 to
 await
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Comforter
 The
 Lords
 ascension
 was
 accomplished
 it
 was
 as
 truly
 a
 literal
 departure
 of
 a
 material
 Being
 as
 His
 resurrection
 had
 been
 an
 actual
 return
 of
 His
 spirit
 to
 His
 own
 corporeal
 body
 theretofore
 dead
 With
 the
 world
 abode
 and
 yet
 abides
 the
 glorious
 promise
 that
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 the
 same
 Being
 who
 ascended
 from
 Olivet
 in
 His
 immortalized
 body
 of
 flesh
 and
 bones
 shall
 return
 descending
 from
 the
 heavens
 in
 similarly
 material
 form
 and
 substance

 the

 of

 and

 years
 Acts
 
 
 Cor
 
 This
 specification
 of
 the
 third
 day
 must
 not
 be
 understood
 as
 meaning
 after
 three
 full
 days
 The
 Jews
 began
 their
 counting
 of
 the
 daily
 hours
 with
 sunset
 therefore
 the
 hour
 before
 sunset
 and
 the
 hour
 following
 belonged
 to
 different
 days
 Jesus
 died
 and
 was
 interred
 during
 Friday
 afternoon
 His
 body
 lay
 in
 the
 tomb
 dead
 during
 part
 of
 Friday
 first
 day
 throughout
 Saturday
 or
 as
 we
 divide
 the
 days
 from
 sunset
 Friday
 to
 sunset
 Saturday
 second
 day
 and
 part
 of
 Sunday
 third
 day
 We
 know
 not
 at
 what
 hour
 between
 Saturday
 sunset
 and
 Sunday
 dawn
 He
 rose
 The
 fact
 that
 an
 earthquake
 occurred
 and
 that
 the
 angel
 of
 the
 Lord
 descended
 and
 rolled
 the
 stone
 from
 the
 portal
 of
 the
 tomb
 in
 the
 early
 dawn
 of
 Sundayfor
 so
 we
 infer
 from
 Matt
 
 does
 not
 prove
 that
 Christ
 had
 not
 already
 risen
 The
 great
 stone
 was
 rolled
 back
 and
 the
 inside
 of
 the
 sepulchre
 exposed
 to
 view
 so
 that
 those
 who
 came
 could
 see
 for
 themselves
 that
 the
 Lords
 body
 was
 no
 longer
 there
 it
 was
 not
 necessary
 to
 open
 the
 portal
 in
 order
 to
 afford
 an
 exit
 to
 the
 resurrected
 Christ
 In
 His
 immortalized
 state
 He
 appeared
 in
 and
 disappeared
 from
 closed
 rooms
 A
 resurrected
 body
 though
 of
 tangible
 substance
 and
 possessing
 all
 the
 organs
 of
 the
 mortal
 tabernacle
 is
 not
 bound
 to
 earth
 by
 gravitation
 nor
 can
 it
 be
 hindered
 in
 its
 movements
 by
 material
 barriers
 To
 us
 who
 conceive
 of
 motion
 only
 in
 the
 directions
 incident
 to
 the
 three
 dimensions
 of
 space
 the
 passing
 of
 a
 solid
 such
 as
 a
 living
 body
 of
 flesh
 and
 bones
 through
 stone
 walls
 is
 necessarily
 incomprehensible
 But
 that
 resurrected
 beings
 move
 in
 accordance
 with
 laws
 making
 such
 passage
 possible
 and
 to
 them
 natural
 is
 evidenced
 not
 only
 by
 the
 instance
 of
 the
 risen
 Christ
 but
 by
 the
 movements
 of
 other
 resurrected
 personages
 Thus
 in
 September
 
 Moroni
 the
 Nephite
 prophet
 who
 had
 died
 about
 
 AD
 appeared
 to
 Joseph
 Smith
 in
 his
 chamber
 three
 times
 during
 one
 night
 coming
 and
 going
 without
 hindrance
 incident
 to
 walls
 or
 roof
 see
 P
 of
 GP
 Joseph
 Smith
 
 also
 The
 Articles
 of
 Faith
 i
 That
 Moroni
 was
 a
 resurrected
 man
 is
 shown
 by
 his
 corporeity
 manifested
 in
 his
 handling
 of
 the
 metallic
 plates
 on
 which
 was
 inscribed
 the
 record
 known
 to
 us
 as
 the
 Book
 of
 Mormon
 So
 also
 resurrected
 beings
 possess
 the
 power
 of
 rendering
 themselves
 visible
 or
 invisible
 to
 the
 physical
 vision
 of
 mortals
 
 Attempts
 to
 Discredit
 the
 Resurrection
 Through
 FalsehoodThe
 inconsistent
 assertion
 that
 Christ
 had
 not
 risen
 but
 that
 His
 body
 had
 been
 stolen
 from
 the
 tomb
 by
 the
 disciples
 has
 been
 sufficiently
 treated
 in
 the
 text
 The
 falsehood
 is
 its
 own
 refutation
 Unbelievers
 of
 later
 date
 recognizing
 the
 palpable
 absurdity
 of
 this
 gross
 attempt
 at
 misrepresentation
 have
 not
 hesitated
 to
 suggest
 other
 hypotheses
 each
 of
 which
 is
 conclusively
 untenable
 Thus
 the
 theory
 based
 upon
 the
 impossible
 assumption
 that
 Christ
 was
 not
 dead
 when
 taken
 from
 the
 cross
 but
 was
 in
 a
 state
 of
 coma
 or
 swoon
 and
 that
 He
 was
 afterward
 resuscitated
 disproves
 itself
 when
 considered
 in
 connection
 with
 recorded
 facts
 The
 spearthrust
 of
 the
 Roman
 soldier
 would
 have
 been
 fatal
 even
 if
 death
 had
 not
 already
 occurred
 The
 body
 was
 taken
 down
 handled
 wrapped
 and
 buried
 by
 members
 of
 the
 Jewish
 council
 who
 cannot
 be
 thought
 of
 as
 actors
 in
 the
 burial
 of
 a
 living
 man
 and
 so
 far
 as
 subsequent
 resuscitation
 is
 concerned
 Edersheim
 vol
 
 p
 
 trenchantly
 remarks
 Not
 to
 speak
 of
 the
 many
 absurdities
 which
 this
 theory
 involves
 it
 really
 shiftsif
 we
 acquit
 the
 disciples
 of
 complicitythe
 fraud
 upon
 Christ
 Himself
 A
 crucified
 person
 removed
 from
 the
 cross
 before
 death
 and
 subsequently
 revived
 could
 not
 have
 walked
 with
 pierced
 and
 mangled
 feet
 on
 the
 very
 day
 of
 his
 resuscitation
 as
 Jesus
 did
 on
 the
 road
 to
 Emmaus
 Another
 theory
 that
 has
 had
 its
 day
 is
 that
 of
 unconscious
 deception
 on
 the
 part
 of
 those
 who
 claimed
 to
 have
 seen
 the
 resurrected
 Christ
 such
 persons
 having
 been
 victims
 of
 subjective
 but
 unreal
 visions
 conjured
 up
 by
 their
 own
 excited
 and
 imaginative
 condition
 The
 independence
 and
 marked
 individuality
 of
 the
 several
 recorded
 appearings
 of
 the
 Lord
 disprove
 the
 vision
 theory
 Such
 subjective
 visual
 illusions
 as
 are
 predicated
 by
 this
 hypothesis
 presuppose
 a
 state
 of
 expectancy
 on
 the
 part
 of
 those
 who
 think
 they
 see
 but
 all
 the
 incidents
 connected
 with
 the
 manifestations
 of
 Jesus
 after
 His
 resurrection
 were
 directly
 opposed
 to
 the
 expectations
 of
 those
 who
 were
 made
 witnesses
 of
 His
 resurrected
 state
 The
 foregoing
 instances
 of
 false
 and
 untenable
 theories
 regarding
 the
 resurrection
 of
 our
 Lord
 are
 cited
 as
 examples
 of
 the
 numerous
 abortive
 attempts
 to
 explain
 away
 the
 greatest
 miracle
 and
 the
 most
 glorious
 fact
 of
 history
 The
 resurrection
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 is
 attested
 by
 evidence
 more
 conclusive
 than
 that
 upon
 which
 rests
 our
 acceptance
 of
 historical
 events
 in
 general
 Yet
 the
 testimony
 of
 our
 Lords
 rising
 from
 the
 dead
 is
 not
 founded
 on
 written
 pages
 To
 him
 who
 seeks
 in
 faith
 and
 sincerity
 shall
 be
 given
 an
 individual
 conviction
 which
 shall
 enable
 him
 to
 reverently
 confess
 as
 exclaimed
 the
 enlightened
 apostle
 of
 old
 Thou
 art
 the
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 the
 living
 God
 Jesus
 who
 is
 God
 the
 Son
 is
 not
 dead
 I
 know
 that
 my
 Redeemer
 liveth

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 APOSTOLIC
 MINISTRY
 MATTHIAS
 ORDAINED
 TO
 THE
 APOSTLESHIP
 After
 witnessing
 the
 Lords
 ascension
 from
 Olivet
 the
 eleven
 apostles
 returned
 to
 Jerusalem
 filled
 with
 joy
 and
 thoroughly
 suffused
 with
 the
 spirit
 of
 adoring
 worship
 Both
 in
 the
 temple
 and
 in
 a
 certain
 upper
 room
 which
 was
 their
 usual
 place
 of
 meeting
 they
 continued
 in
 prayer
 and
 supplication
 often
 in
 association
 with
 other
 disciples
 including
 Mary
 the
 mother
 of
 the
 Lord
 some
 of
 her
 sons
 and
 the
 little
 sisterhood
 of
 faithful
 women
 who
 had
 ministered
 to
 Jesus
 in
 Galilee
 and
 had
 followed
 Him
 thence
 to
 Jerusalem
 and
 to
 Calvary
 The
 disciples
 most
 of
 whom
 had
 been
 dispersed
 by
 the
 tragic
 events
 of
 that
 last
 and
 fateful
 Passover
 had
 gathered
 again
 with
 renewed
 and
 fortified
 faith
 about
 the
 great
 fact
 of
 the
 Lords
 resurrection
 Christ
 had
 become
 the
 firstfruits
 of
 them
 that
 slept
 the
 first
 begotten
 of
 the
 dead
 and
 the
 firstborn
 of
 the
 race
 to
 rise
 from
 death
 to
 immortality
 They
 knew
 that
 not
 only
 had
 the
 grave
 been
 compelled
 to
 give
 up
 the
 body
 of
 their
 Lord
 but
 that
 a
 way
 had
 been
 provided
 for
 the
 striking
 of
 the
 fetters
 of
 death
 from
 every
 soul
 Immediately
 following
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 many
 righteous
 ones
 who
 had
 slept
 in
 the
 tomb
 had
 been
 resurrected
 and
 had
 appeared
 in
 Jerusalem
 revealing
 themselves
 unto
 many
 The
 universality
 of
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 dead
 was
 soon
 to
 become
 a
 prominent
 feature
 of
 apostolic
 teaching
 The
 first
 official
 act
 undertaken
 by
 the
 apostles
 was
 the
 filling
 of
 the
 vacancy
 in
 the
 council
 of
 the
 Twelve
 occasioned
 by
 the
 apostasy
 and
 suicide
 of
 Judas
 Iscariot
 Sometime
 between
 the
 ascension
 of
 Christ
 and
 the
 feast
 of
 Pentecost
 when
 the
 Eleven
 and
 other
 disciples
 in
 all
 about
 a
 hundred
 and
 twenty
 were
 together
 with
 one
 accord
 in
 prayer
 and
 supplication
 Peter
 laid
 the
 matter
 before
 the
 assembled
 Church
 pointing
 out
 that
 the
 fall
 of
 Judas
 had
 been
 foreseen
 and
 citing
 the
 psalmists
 invocation
 Let
 his
 habitation
 be
 desolate
 and
 let
 no
 man
 dwell
 therein
 and
 his
 bishoprick
 let
 another
 take
 Peter
 affirmed
 the
 necessity
 of
 completing
 the
 apostolic
 quorum
 and
 he
 thus
 set
 forth
 the
 qualifications
 essential
 in
 the
 one
 who
 should
 be
 ordained
 to
 the
 Holy
 Apostleship
 Wherefore
 of
 these
 men
 which
 have
 companied
 with
 us
 all
 the
 time
 that
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 went
 in
 and
 out
 among
 us
 beginning
 from
 the
 baptism
 of
 John
 unto
 that
 same
 day
 that
 he
 was
 taken
 up
 from
 us
 must
 one
 be
 ordained
 to
 be
 a
 witness
 with
 us
 of
 his
 resurrection
 Two
 faithful
 disciples
 were
 nominated
 by
 the
 Eleven
 Joseph
 Barsabas
 and
 Matthias
 In
 earnest
 supplication
 the
 assembly
 besought
 the
 Lord
 to
 indicate
 whether
 either
 of
 these
 men
 and
 if
 so
 which
 was
 to
 be
 chosen
 for
 the
 exalted
 office
 then
 they
 gave
 forth
 their
 lots
 and
 the
 lot
 fell
 upon
 Matthias
 and
 he
 was
 numbered
 with
 the
 eleven
 apostles
 The
 proceeding
 throughout
 is
 deeply
 significant
 and
 instructive
 The
 Eleven
 fully
 realized
 that
 on
 them
 lay
 the
 responsibility
 and
 in
 them
 was
 vested
 the
 authority
 to
 organize
 and
 develop
 the
 Church
 of
 Christ
 that
 the
 council
 or
 quorum
 of
 the
 apostles
 was
 limited
 to
 a
 membership
 of
 twelve
 and
 that
 the
 new
 apostle
 like
 themselves
 must
 be
 competent
 to
 testify
 in
 special
 and
 personal
 witness
 concerning
 the
 earthly
 ministry
 death
 and
 resurrection
 of
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 The
 selection
 of
 Matthias
 was
 accomplished
 in
 a
 general
 assembly
 of
 the
 Primitive
 Church
 and
 while
 the
 nominations
 were
 made
 by
 the
 apostles
 all
 present
 appear
 by
 implication
 to
 have
 had
 a
 voice
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 installation
 The
 principle
 of
 authoritative
 administration
 through
 common
 consent
 of
 the
 membership
 so
 impressively
 exemplified
 in
 the
 choosing
 of
 Matthias
 was
 followed
 a
 few
 weeks
 later
 by
 the
 selection
 of
 seven
 men
 of
 honest
 report
 full
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 and
 wisdom
 who
 having
 been
 sustained
 by
 the
 vote
 of
 the
 Church
 were
 set
 apart
 to
 a
 special
 ministry
 by
 the
 layingon
 of
 the
 apostles
 hands
 THE
 BESTOWAL
 OF
 THE
 HOLY
 GHOST
 At
 the
 time
 of
 Pentecost
 which
 fell
 on
 the
 fiftieth
 day
 after
 the
 Passover
 and
 therefore
 at
 this
 particular
 recurrence
 about
 nine
 days
 after
 Christs
 ascension
 the
 apostles
 were
 all
 with
 one
 accord
 in
 one
 place
 engaged
 in
 their
 customary
 devotions
 and
 waiting
 as
 instructed
 until
 they
 would
 be
 endowed
 with
 a
 particular
 bestowal
 of
 power
 from
 on
 high
 The
 promised
 baptism
 by
 fire
 and
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 befell
 them
 on
 that
 day
 Suddenly
 there
 came
 a
 sound
 from
 heaven
 as
 of
 a
 rushing
 mighty
 wind
 and
 it
 filled
 all
 the
 house
 where
 they
 were
 sitting
 And
 there
 appeared
 unto
 them
 cloven
 tongues
 like
 as
 of
 fire
 and
 it
 sat
 upon
 each
 of
 them
 And
 they
 were
 all
 filled
 with
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 and
 began
 to
 speak
 with
 other
 tongues
 as
 the
 Spirit
 gave
 them
 utterance
 The
 sound
 from
 heaven
 as
 of
 a
 rushing
 mighty
 wind
 was
 heard
 abroad
 and
 a
 multitude
 gathered
 about
 the
 place
 The
 visible
 manifestation
 of
 cloven
 tongues
 like
 as
 of
 fire
 by
 which
 each
 of
 the
 Twelve
 was
 invested
 was
 seen
 by
 those
 within
 the
 house
 but
 apparently
 not
 by
 the
 gathering
 crowds
 The
 apostles
 spoke
 to
 the
 multitude
 and
 a
 great
 miracle
 was
 wrought
 by
 which
 every
 man
 heard
 them
 speak
 in
 his
 own
 language
 for
 the
 apostles
 now
 richly
 gifted
 spake
 in
 many
 tongues
 as
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 by
 whom
 they
 had
 been
 endowed
 gave
 them
 utterance
 There
 were
 present
 men
 from
 many
 lands
 and
 of
 many
 nations
 and
 their
 languages
 were
 diverse
 In
 amazement
 some
 of
 them
 said
 Behold
 are
 not
 all
 these
 which
 speak
 Galileans
 And
 how
 hear
 we
 every
 man
 in
 our
 own
 tongue
 wherein
 we
 were
 born
 While
 many
 were
 impressed
 by
 the
 preternatural
 ability
 of
 the
 brethren
 others
 in
 mocking
 tones
 said
 the
 men
 were
 drunken
 This
 instance
 of
 Satanic
 prompting
 to
 inconsiderate
 speech
 is
 especially
 illustrative
 of
 inconsistency
 and
 rash
 ineptitude
 Strong
 drink
 gives
 to
 no
 man
 wisdom
 it
 steals
 away
 his
 senses
 and
 makes
 of
 him
 a
 fool
 Then
 Peter
 as
 the
 president
 of
 the
 Twelve
 stood
 up
 and
 proclaimed
 in
 behalf
 of
 himself
 and
 his
 brethren
 Ye
 men
 of
 Judea
 and
 all
 ye
 that
 dwell
 at
 Jerusalem
 be
 this
 known
 unto
 you
 and
 hearken
 to
 my
 words
 for
 these
 are
 not
 drunken
 as
 ye
 suppose
 seeing
 it
 is
 but
 the
 third
 hour
 of
 the
 day
 It
 was
 the
 Jewish
 custom
 particularly
 on
 festival
 days
 to
 abstain
 from
 food
 and
 drink
 until
 after
 the
 morning
 service
 in
 synagog
 which
 was
 held
 about
 the
 third
 hour
 or
 nine
 oclock
 in
 the
 forenoon
 The
 apostle
 cited
 ancient
 prophecy
 embodying
 the
 promise
 of
 Jehovah
 that
 He
 would
 pour
 out
 His
 Spirit
 upon
 all
 flesh
 so
 that
 wonders
 would
 be
 wrought
 even
 as
 those
 there
 present
 witnessed
 Then
 boldly
 did
 Peter
 testify
 of
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 whom
 he
 characterized
 as
 a
 man
 approved
 of
 God
 among
 you
 by
 miracles
 and
 wonders
 and
 signs
 which
 God
 did
 by
 him
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 you
 as
 ye
 yourselves
 also
 know
 and
 reminding
 them
 in
 accusing
 earnestness
 of
 the
 awful
 crime
 to
 which
 they
 had
 been
 in
 some
 degree
 parties
 he
 continued
 Him
 being
 delivered
 by
 the
 determinate
 counsel
 and
 foreknowledge
 of
 God
 ye
 have
 taken
 and
 by
 wicked
 hands
 have
 crucified
 and
 slain
 whom
 God
 hath
 raised
 up
 having
 loosed
 the
 pains
 of
 death
 because
 it
 was
 not
 possible
 that
 he
 should
 be
 holden
 of
 it
 Citing
 the
 inspired
 outburst
 of
 the
 psalmist
 who
 had
 sung
 in
 jubilant
 measure
 of
 the
 soul
 that
 should
 not
 be
 left
 in
 hell
 and
 of
 the
 flesh
 that
 should
 not
 see
 corruption
 he
 showed
 the
 application
 of
 these
 scriptures
 to
 the
 Christ
 and
 fearlessly
 affirmed
 This
 Jesus
 hath
 God
 raised
 up
 whereof
 we
 all
 are
 witnesses
 Therefore
 being
 by
 the
 right
 hand
 of
 God
 exalted
 and
 having
 received
 of
 the
 Father
 the
 promise
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 he
 hath
 shed
 forth
 this
 which
 ye
 now
 see
 and
 hear
 With
 increasing
 fervency
 fearing
 neither
 derision
 nor
 violence
 and
 driving
 home
 to
 the
 hearts
 of
 his
 enthralled
 listeners
 the
 fearful
 fact
 of
 their
 guilt
 Peter
 proclaimed
 as
 in
 voice
 of
 thunder
 Therefore
 let
 all
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 know
 assuredly
 that
 God
 hath
 made
 that
 same
 Jesus
 whom
 ye
 have
 crucified
 both
 Lord
 and
 Christ
 The
 power
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 could
 not
 be
 resisted
 to
 every
 earnest
 soul
 it
 carried
 conviction
 They
 that
 heard
 were
 pricked
 in
 their
 hearts
 and
 in
 contrition
 cried
 out
 to
 the
 apostles
 Men
 and
 brethren
 what
 shall
 we
 do
 Now
 that
 they
 were
 prepared
 for
 the
 message
 of
 salvation
 it
 was
 given
 without
 reserve
 Repent
 answered
 Peter
 and
 be
 baptized
 every
 one
 of
 you
 in
 the
 name
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 for
 the
 remission
 of
 sins
 and
 ye
 shall
 receive
 the
 gift
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 For
 the
 promise
 is
 unto
 you
 and
 to
 your
 children
 and
 to
 all
 that
 are
 afar
 off
 even
 as
 many
 as
 the
 Lord
 our
 God
 shall
 call
 To
 the
 apostles
 testimony
 to
 the
 exhortation
 and
 warning
 the
 people
 responded
 with
 profession
 of
 faith
 and
 repentance
 Their
 joy
 was
 comparable
 to
 that
 of
 the
 spirits
 in
 prison
 to
 whom
 the
 disembodied
 Christ
 had
 borne
 the
 authoritative
 word
 of
 redemption
 and
 salvation
 Those
 who
 repented
 and
 confessed
 their
 belief
 in
 Christ
 at
 that
 memorable
 Pentecost
 were
 received
 into
 the
 Church
 by
 baptism
 to
 the
 number
 of
 about
 three
 thousand
 That
 their
 conversion
 was
 genuine
 and
 not
 the
 effect
 of
 a
 passing
 enthusiasm
 that
 they
 were
 literally
 born
 again
 through
 baptism
 into
 a
 newness
 of
 life
 is
 evidenced
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 they
 endured
 in
 the
 faithand
 they
 continued
 steadfastly
 in
 the
 apostles
 doctrine
 and
 fellowship
 and
 in
 breaking
 of
 bread
 and
 in
 prayers
 So
 devoted
 were
 these
 early
 converts
 so
 richly
 blessed
 with
 the
 outpouring
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 was
 the
 Church
 in
 those
 days
 that
 the
 members
 voluntarily
 disposed
 of
 their
 individual
 possessions
 and
 had
 all
 things
 in
 common
 To
 them
 faith
 in
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 of
 greater
 worth
 than
 the
 wealth
 of
 earth
 Among
 them
 there
 was
 nothing
 called
 mine
 or
 thine
 but
 all
 things
 were
 theirs
 in
 the
 Lord
 Signs
 and
 wonders
 followed
 the
 apostles
 and
 the
 Lord
 added
 to
 the
 church
 daily
 such
 as
 should
 be
 saved
 Through
 the
 bestowal
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 the
 apostles
 had
 become
 changed
 men
 As
 made
 clear
 to
 them
 by
 the
 Spirit
 of
 Truth
 the
 scriptures
 constituted
 a
 record
 of
 preparation
 for
 the
 events
 to
 which
 they
 were
 special
 and
 ordained
 witnesses
 Peter
 who
 but
 a
 few
 weeks
 earlier
 had
 quailed
 before
 a
 servingmaid
 now
 spoke
 openly
 fearing
 none
 Seeing
 once
 a
 lame
 beggar
 at
 the
 Gate
 Beautiful
 which
 led
 into
 the
 temple
 court
 he
 took
 the
 afflicted
 one
 by
 the
 hand
 saying
 Silver
 and
 gold
 have
 I
 none
 but
 such
 as
 I
 have
 give
 I
 thee
 In
 the
 name
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 of
 Nazareth
 rise
 up
 and
 walk
 The
 man
 was
 healed
 and
 leaped
 in
 the
 exuberance
 of
 his
 newly
 found
 strength
 then
 he
 went
 with
 Peter
 and
 John
 into
 the
 temple
 praising
 God
 aloud
 An
 amazed
 crowd
 which
 grew
 to
 include
 about
 five
 thousand
 men
 gathered
 around
 the
 apostles
 in
 Solomons
 Porch
 and
 Peter
 observing
 their
 wonderment
 seized
 on
 the
 occasion
 to
 preach
 to
 them
 Jesus
 the
 Crucified
 He
 ascribed
 all
 praise
 for
 the
 miracle
 to
 the
 Christ
 whom
 the
 Jews
 had
 delivered
 up
 to
 be
 slain
 and
 in
 unambiguous
 accusation
 declared
 The
 God
 of
 Abraham
 and
 of
 Isaac
 and
 of
 Jacob
 the
 God
 of
 our
 fathers
 hath
 glorified
 his
 Son
 Jesus
 whom
 ye
 delivered
 up
 and
 denied
 him
 in
 the
 presence
 of
 Pilate
 when
 he
 was
 determined
 to
 let
 him
 go
 But
 ye
 denied
 the
 Holy
 One
 and
 the
 Just
 and
 desired
 a
 murderer
 to
 be
 granted
 unto
 you
 and
 killed
 the
 Prince
 of
 life
 whom
 God
 hath
 raised
 from
 the
 dead
 whereof
 we
 are
 witnesses
 In
 merciful
 recognition
 of
 the
 ignorance
 in
 which
 they
 had
 sinned
 he
 exhorted
 them
 to
 expiatory
 penitence
 crying
 Repent
 ye
 therefore
 and
 be
 converted
 that
 your
 sins
 may
 be
 blotted
 out
 when
 the
 times
 of
 refreshing
 shall
 come
 from
 the
 presence
 of
 the
 Lord
 and
 he
 shall
 send
 Jesus
 Christ
 which
 before
 was
 preached
 unto
 you
 whom
 the
 heaven
 must
 receive
 until
 the
 times
 of
 restitution
 of
 all
 things
 which
 God
 hath
 spoken
 by
 the
 mouth
 of
 all
 his
 holy
 prophets
 since
 the
 world
 began
 There
 was
 no
 encouragement
 to
 a
 belief
 that
 their
 sins
 could
 be
 annulled
 by
 wordy
 profession
 a
 due
 season
 of
 repentance
 was
 their
 privilege
 if
 so
 be
 they
 would
 believe
 As
 Peter
 and
 John
 thus
 testified
 the
 priests
 and
 the
 captain
 of
 the
 temple
 together
 with
 the
 ruling
 Sadducees
 came
 upon
 them
 toward
 evening
 and
 put
 them
 in
 prison
 to
 await
 the
 action
 of
 the
 judges
 next
 day
 On
 the
 morrow
 they
 were
 arraigned
 before
 Annas
 Caiaphas
 and
 other
 officials
 who
 demanded
 of
 them
 by
 what
 power
 or
 in
 whose
 name
 they
 had
 healed
 the
 lame
 man
 Peter
 impelled
 by
 the
 power
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 answered
 Be
 it
 known
 unto
 you
 all
 and
 to
 all
 the
 people
 of
 Israel
 that
 by
 the
 name
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 of
 Nazareth
 whom
 ye
 crucified
 whom
 God
 raised
 from
 the
 dead
 even
 by
 him
 doth
 this
 man
 stand
 here
 before
 you
 whole
 This
 is
 the
 stone
 which
 was
 set
 at
 nought
 of
 you
 builders
 which
 is
 become
 the
 head
 of
 the
 corner
 Neither
 is
 there
 salvation
 in
 any
 other
 for
 there
 is
 none
 other
 name
 under
 heaven
 given
 among
 men
 whereby
 we
 must
 be
 saved
 The
 hierarchy
 learned
 to
 their
 consternation
 that
 the
 work
 they
 had
 sought
 to
 destroy
 through
 the
 crucifixion
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 spreading
 now
 as
 it
 had
 never
 spread
 before
 In
 desperation
 they
 commanded
 the
 apostles
 Not
 to
 speak
 at
 all
 nor
 teach
 in
 the
 name
 of
 Jesus
 But
 Peter
 and
 John
 answered
 boldly
 Whether
 it
 be
 right
 in
 the
 sight
 of
 God
 to
 hearken
 unto
 you
 more
 than
 unto
 God
 judge
 ye
 For
 we
 cannot
 but
 speak
 the
 things
 which
 we
 have
 seen
 and
 heard
 This
 rejoinder
 of
 righteous
 defiance
 the
 priestly
 rulers
 dared
 not
 openly
 resent
 they
 had
 to
 content
 themselves
 with
 threats
 The
 Church
 grew
 with
 surprizing
 rapidity
 believers
 were
 the
 more
 added
 to
 the
 Lord
 multitudes
 both
 of
 men
 and
 women
 So
 abundantly
 was
 the
 gift
 of
 healing
 manifest
 through
 the
 ministrations
 of
 the
 apostles
 that
 as
 formerly
 to
 Christ
 now
 to
 them
 the
 people
 flocked
 bringing
 their
 sick
 folk
 and
 those
 possessed
 of
 evil
 spirits
 and
 all
 were
 healed
 So
 great
 was
 the
 faith
 of
 the
 believers
 that
 they
 laid
 their
 afflicted
 ones
 on
 couches
 in
 the
 streets
 that
 at
 the
 least
 the
 shadow
 of
 Peter
 passing
 by
 might
 overshadow
 some
 of
 them
 The
 high
 priest
 and
 his
 haughty
 Sadducean
 associates
 caused
 the
 apostles
 to
 be
 again
 arrested
 and
 thrown
 into
 the
 common
 prison
 But
 that
 night
 the
 angel
 of
 the
 Lord
 opened
 the
 dungeon
 doors
 and
 brought
 the
 prisoners
 forth
 telling
 them
 to
 go
 into
 the
 temple
 and
 further
 proclaim
 their
 testimony
 of
 the
 Christ
 This
 the
 apostles
 did
 and
 were
 so
 engaged
 when
 the
 Sanhedrin
 assembled
 to
 put
 them
 on
 trial
 The
 officers
 who
 were
 sent
 to
 bring
 the
 prisoners
 to
 the
 judgment
 hall
 returned
 saying
 The
 prison
 truly
 found
 we
 shut
 with
 all
 safety
 and
 the
 keepers
 standing
 without
 before
 the
 doors
 but
 when
 we
 had
 opened
 we
 found
 no
 man
 within
 As
 the
 judges
 sat
 in
 impotent
 consternation
 an
 informer
 appeared
 with
 the
 word
 that
 the
 men
 they
 wanted
 were
 at
 that
 moment
 preaching
 in
 the
 courts
 The
 captain
 and
 his
 guard
 arrested
 the
 apostles
 a
 third
 time
 and
 brought
 them
 in
 but
 without
 violence
 for
 they
 feared
 the
 people
 The
 high
 priest
 accused
 the
 prisoners
 by
 question
 and
 affirmation
 Did
 not
 we
 straitly
 command
 you
 that
 ye
 should
 not
 teach
 in
 this
 name
 and
 behold
 ye
 have
 filled
 Jerusalem
 with
 your
 doctrine
 and
 intend
 to
 bring
 this
 mans
 blood
 upon
 us
 Yet
 how
 recently
 had
 those
 same
 rulers
 led
 the
 rabble
 in
 the
 awful
 imprecation
 His
 blood
 be
 on
 us
 and
 on
 our
 children
 Peter
 and
 the
 other
 apostles
 undaunted
 by
 the
 august
 presence
 and
 undeterred
 by
 threatening
 words
 or
 actions
 answered
 with
 the
 direct
 countercharge
 that
 they
 who
 sat
 there
 to
 judge
 were
 the
 slayers
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 Ponder
 well
 the
 solemn
 affirmation
 We
 ought
 to
 obey
 God
 rather
 than
 men
 The
 God
 of
 our
 fathers
 raised
 up
 Jesus
 whom
 ye
 slew
 and
 hanged
 on
 a
 tree
 Him
 hath
 God
 exalted
 with
 his
 right
 hand
 to
 be
 a
 Prince
 and
 a
 Saviour
 for
 to
 give
 repentance
 to
 Israel
 and
 forgiveness
 of
 sins
 And
 we
 are
 his
 witnesses
 of
 these
 things
 and
 so
 is
 also
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 whom
 God
 hath
 given
 to
 them
 that
 obey
 him
 Closing
 locking
 bolting
 their
 hearts
 against
 the
 testimony
 of
 the
 Lords
 own
 the
 chief
 priests
 scribes
 and
 elders
 of
 the
 people
 counseled
 together
 as
 to
 how
 they
 could
 put
 these
 men
 to
 death
 There
 was
 at
 least
 one
 honorable
 exception
 among
 the
 murderously
 inclined
 councilors
 Gamaliel
 who
 was
 a
 Pharisee
 and
 a
 noted
 doctor
 of
 the
 law
 the
 teacher
 of
 Saul
 of
 Tarsus
 afterward
 known
 through
 conversion
 works
 and
 divine
 commission
 as
 Paul
 the
 apostle
 rose
 in
 the
 council
 and
 having
 directed
 that
 the
 apostles
 be
 removed
 from
 the
 hall
 warned
 his
 colleagues
 against
 the
 injustice
 they
 had
 in
 mind
 He
 cited
 the
 cases
 of
 men
 falsely
 claiming
 to
 have
 been
 sent
 of
 God
 everyone
 of
 whom
 had
 come
 to
 grief
 with
 utter
 and
 most
 ignominious
 failure
 of
 his
 seditious
 plans
 so
 would
 these
 men
 come
 to
 nought
 if
 the
 work
 they
 professed
 proved
 to
 be
 of
 men
 But
 added
 the
 dispassionate
 and
 learned
 doctor
 if
 it
 be
 of
 God
 ye
 cannot
 overthrow
 it
 lest
 haply
 ye
 be
 found
 even
 to
 fight
 against
 God
 Gamaliels
 advice
 prevailed
 for
 the
 time
 being
 to
 the
 extent
 of
 causing
 the
 apostles
 lives
 to
 be
 spared
 but
 the
 council
 in
 contravention
 of
 justice
 and
 propriety
 had
 the
 prisoners
 beaten
 Then
 the
 brethren
 were
 discharged
 with
 the
 renewed
 injunction
 that
 they
 speak
 not
 in
 the
 name
 of
 Jesus
 They
 went
 out
 rejoicing
 that
 they
 were
 counted
 worthy
 to
 suffer
 stripes
 and
 humiliation
 in
 defense
 of
 the
 Lords
 name
 and
 daily
 both
 in
 the
 temple
 and
 by
 house
 to
 house
 visitation
 they
 valiantly
 taught
 and
 preached
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 Converts
 to
 the
 Church
 were
 not
 confined
 to
 the
 laity
 a
 great
 company
 of
 the
 priests
 swelled
 the
 number
 of
 the
 disciples
 who
 multiplied
 greatly
 in
 Jerusalem
 STEPHEN
 THE
 MARTYR
 HIS
 VISION
 OF
 THE
 LORD
 First
 among
 the
 seven
 men
 of
 honest
 report
 who
 were
 set
 apart
 under
 the
 hands
 of
 the
 apostles
 to
 administer
 the
 common
 store
 of
 the
 Church
 community
 was
 Stephen
 a
 man
 eminent
 in
 faith
 and
 good
 works
 through
 whom
 the
 Lord
 wrought
 many
 miracles
 He
 was
 zealous
 in
 service
 aggressive
 in
 doctrine
 and
 fearless
 as
 a
 minister
 of
 Christ
 Some
 of
 the
 foreign
 Jews
 who
 maintained
 a
 synagog
 in
 Jerusalem
 engaged
 Stephen
 in
 disputation
 and
 being
 unable
 to
 resist
 the
 wisdom
 and
 the
 spirit
 by
 which
 he
 spake
 conspired
 to
 have
 him
 charged
 with
 heresy
 and
 blasphemy
 He
 was
 brought
 before
 the
 council
 on
 the
 word
 of
 men
 suborned
 to
 witness
 against
 him
 and
 these
 averred
 that
 they
 had
 heard
 him
 speak
 blasphemous
 words
 against
 Moses
 and
 against
 God
 The
 perjured
 accusers
 further
 testified
 that
 he
 had
 repeatedly
 spoken
 blasphemously
 against
 the
 temple
 and
 the
 law
 and
 had
 even
 declared
 that
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 would
 some
 day
 destroy
 the
 temple
 and
 change
 the
 Mosaic
 ceremonies
 The
 charge
 was
 utterly
 false
 in
 spirit
 and
 fact
 though
 possibly
 in
 a
 sense
 partly
 true
 in
 form
 for
 judging
 by
 what
 we
 have
 of
 record
 concerning
 Stephens
 character
 and
 works
 he
 was
 a
 zealous
 preacher
 of
 the
 word
 as
 a
 world
 religion
 through
 which
 the
 exclusiveness
 and
 alleged
 sanctity
 of
 Jerusalem
 as
 the
 holy
 city
 and
 of
 the
 now
 desecrated
 temple
 as
 the
 earthly
 abidingplace
 of
 Jehovah
 would
 be
 abrogated
 furthermore
 he
 seems
 to
 have
 realized
 that
 the
 law
 of
 Moses
 had
 been
 fulfilled
 in
 the
 mission
 of
 the
 Messiah
 When
 the
 Sanhedrists
 looked
 upon
 him
 his
 face
 was
 illumined
 and
 they
 saw
 it
 as
 it
 had
 been
 the
 face
 of
 an
 angel
 In
 answer
 to
 the
 charge
 he
 delivered
 an
 address
 which
 on
 critical
 analysis
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 extemporaneous
 nevertheless
 it
 is
 strikingly
 logical
 and
 impressive
 in
 argument
 The
 delivery
 was
 abruptly
 terminated
 however
 by
 a
 murderous
 assault
 In
 effective
 epitome
 Stephen
 traced
 the
 history
 of
 the
 covenant
 people
 from
 the
 time
 of
 Abraham
 down
 showing
 that
 the
 patriarchs
 and
 in
 turn
 Moses
 and
 the
 prophets
 had
 lived
 and
 ministered
 in
 progressive
 preparation
 for
 the
 development
 of
 which
 those
 present
 were
 witnesses
 He
 pointed
 out
 that
 Moses
 had
 foretold
 the
 coming
 of
 a
 Prophet
 who
 was
 none
 other
 than
 Jehovah
 whom
 their
 fathers
 had
 worshipped
 in
 the
 wilderness
 before
 the
 tabernacle
 and
 later
 in
 the
 temple
 but
 he
 affirmed
 the
 most
 High
 dwelleth
 not
 in
 temples
 made
 with
 hands
 the
 most
 gorgeous
 of
 which
 could
 be
 but
 small
 to
 Him
 who
 said
 Heaven
 is
 my
 throne
 and
 earth
 is
 my
 footstool
 It
 is
 plain
 to
 be
 seen
 that
 Stephens
 speech
 was
 not
 one
 of
 vindication
 and
 far
 from
 a
 plea
 in
 his
 own
 defense
 it
 was
 a
 proclamation
 of
 the
 word
 and
 purposes
 of
 God
 by
 a
 devoted
 servant
 who
 had
 no
 thought
 for
 personal
 consequences
 In
 forceful
 arraignment
 he
 thus
 addressed
 his
 judges
 Ye
 stiffnecked
 and
 uncircumcised
 in
 heart
 and
 ears
 ye
 do
 always
 resist
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 as
 your
 fathers
 did
 so
 do
 ye
 Which
 of
 the
 prophets
 have
 not
 your
 fathers
 persecuted
 and
 they
 have
 slain
 them
 which
 shewed
 before
 of
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Just
 One
 of
 whom
 ye
 have
 been
 now
 the
 betrayers
 and
 murderers
 Maddened
 at
 this
 direct
 accusation
 the
 Sanhedrists
 gnashed
 on
 him
 with
 their
 teeth
 He
 knew
 that
 they
 thirsted
 for
 his
 blood
 but
 energized
 by
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 he
 looked
 steadfastly
 upward
 and
 exclaimed
 in
 rapture
 Behold
 I
 see
 the
 heavens
 opened
 and
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 standing
 on
 the
 right
 hand
 of
 God
 This
 is
 the
 first
 New
 Testament
 record
 of
 a
 manifestation
 of
 Christ
 to
 mortal
 eyes
 by
 vision
 or
 otherwise
 subsequent
 to
 His
 ascension
 The
 priestly
 rulers
 cried
 aloud
 and
 stopped
 their
 ears
 to
 what
 they
 chose
 to
 regard
 as
 blasphemous
 utterances
 and
 rushing
 upon
 the
 prisoner
 with
 one
 accord
 they
 hurried
 him
 outside
 the
 city
 walls
 and
 stoned
 him
 to
 death
 True
 to
 his
 Master
 he
 prayed
 Lord
 Jesus
 receive
 my
 spirit
 and
 then
 crushed
 to
 earth
 he
 cried
 with
 a
 loud
 voice
 Lord
 lay
 not
 this
 sin
 to
 their
 charge
 And
 when
 he
 had
 said
 this
 he
 fell
 asleep
 So
 died
 the
 first
 martyr
 for
 the
 testimony
 of
 the
 risen
 Christ
 He
 was
 slain
 by
 a
 mob
 comprizing
 chief
 priests
 scribes
 and
 elders
 of
 the
 people
 What
 cared
 they
 that
 no
 sentence
 had
 been
 pronounced
 against
 him
 or
 that
 they
 were
 acting
 in
 reckless
 defiance
 of
 Roman
 law
 Devout
 men
 bore
 the
 mangled
 body
 to
 its
 burial
 and
 all
 the
 disciples
 lamented
 greatly
 Persecution
 increased
 and
 members
 of
 the
 Church
 were
 scattered
 through
 many
 lands
 wherein
 they
 preached
 the
 gospel
 and
 won
 many
 to
 the
 Lord
 The
 blood
 of
 Stephen
 the
 martyr
 proved
 to
 be
 rich
 and
 virile
 seed
 from
 which
 sprang
 a
 great
 harvest
 of
 souls
 CHRIST
 MANIFESTS
 HIMSELF
 TO
 SAUL
 OF
 TARSUS
 LATER
 KNOWN
 AS
 PAUL
 THE
 APOSTLE
 Among
 the
 disputants
 who
 when
 defeated
 in
 discussion
 conspired
 against
 Stephen
 and
 brought
 about
 his
 death
 were
 Jews
 from
 Cilicia
 Associated
 with
 them
 was
 a
 young
 man
 named
 Saul
 a
 native
 of
 the
 Cilician
 city
 of
 Tarsus
 This
 man
 was
 an
 able
 scholar
 a
 forceful
 controversialist
 an
 ardent
 defender
 of
 what
 he
 regarded
 as
 the
 right
 and
 a
 vigorous
 assailant
 of
 what
 to
 him
 was
 wrong
 Though
 born
 in
 Tarsus
 he
 had
 been
 brought
 to
 Jerusalem
 in
 early
 youth
 and
 had
 there
 grown
 up
 a
 strict
 Pharisee
 and
 an
 aggressive
 supporter
 of
 Judaism
 He
 was
 a
 student
 of
 the
 law
 under
 the
 tutelage
 of
 Gamaliel
 one
 of
 the
 most
 eminent
 masters
 of
 the
 time
 and
 had
 the
 confidence
 of
 the
 high
 priest
 His
 father
 or
 perhaps
 an
 earlier
 progenitor
 had
 acquired
 the
 rank
 of
 Roman
 citizenship
 and
 Saul
 was
 a
 born
 heir
 to
 that
 distinction
 Saul
 was
 a
 violent
 opponent
 of
 the
 apostles
 and
 the
 Church
 and
 had
 made
 himself
 a
 party
 to
 the
 death
 of
 Stephen
 by
 openly
 consenting
 thereunto
 and
 by
 holding
 in
 personal
 custody
 the
 garments
 of
 the
 false
 witnesses
 while
 they
 stoned
 the
 martyr
 He
 wrought
 havoc
 in
 the
 Church
 by
 entering
 private
 houses
 and
 haling
 thence
 men
 and
 women
 suspected
 of
 belief
 in
 the
 Christ
 and
 these
 he
 caused
 to
 be
 cast
 into
 prison
 The
 persecution
 in
 which
 he
 took
 so
 prominent
 a
 part
 caused
 a
 scattering
 of
 the
 disciples
 throughout
 Judea
 Samaria
 and
 other
 lands
 though
 the
 apostles
 remained
 and
 continued
 their
 ministry
 in
 Jerusalem
 Not
 content
 with
 local
 activity
 against
 the
 Church
 Saul
 yet
 breathing
 out
 threatenings
 and
 slaughter
 against
 the
 disciples
 of
 the
 Lord
 went
 unto
 the
 high
 priest
 and
 desired
 of
 him
 letters
 to
 Damascus
 to
 the
 synagogues
 that
 if
 he
 found
 any
 of
 this
 way
 whether
 they
 were
 men
 or
 women
 he
 might
 bring
 them
 bound
 unto
 Jerusalem
 As
 Saul
 and
 his
 attendants
 neared
 Damascus
 they
 were
 halted
 by
 an
 occurrence
 of
 aweinspiring
 grandeur
 At
 noontide
 there
 suddenly
 appeared
 a
 light
 far
 exceeding
 the
 brightness
 of
 the
 sun
 and
 in
 this
 dazzling
 splendor
 the
 whole
 party
 was
 enveloped
 so
 that
 they
 fell
 to
 the
 ground
 in
 terror
 In
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 unearthly
 glory
 a
 sound
 was
 heard
 which
 to
 Saul
 alone
 was
 intelligible
 as
 an
 articulate
 voice
 he
 heard
 and
 understood
 the
 reproving
 question
 spoken
 in
 the
 Hebrew
 tongue
 Saul
 Saul
 why
 persecutest
 thou
 me
 In
 trepidation
 he
 inquired
 Who
 art
 thou
 Lord
 The
 reply
 sounded
 the
 heart
 of
 Saul
 to
 its
 depths
 I
 am
 Jesus
 of
 Nazareth
 whom
 thou
 persecutest
 and
 continued
 as
 in
 sympathetic
 consideration
 of
 the
 persecutors
 situation
 and
 the
 renunciation
 that
 would
 be
 required
 of
 him
 It
 is
 hard
 for
 thee
 to
 kick
 against
 the
 pricks
 The
 enormity
 of
 his
 hostility
 and
 enmity
 against
 the
 Lord
 and
 His
 people
 filled
 the
 mans
 soul
 with
 horror
 and
 in
 trembling
 contrition
 he
 asked
 Lord
 what
 wilt
 thou
 have
 me
 to
 do
 The
 reply
 was
 Arise
 and
 go
 into
 the
 city
 and
 it
 shall
 be
 told
 thee
 what
 thou
 must
 do
 The
 brilliancy
 of
 the
 heavenly
 light
 had
 blinded
 Saul
 His
 companions
 led
 him
 into
 Damascus
 where
 at
 the
 house
 of
 Judas
 in
 the
 street
 called
 Straight
 he
 sat
 in
 darkness
 for
 three
 days
 during
 which
 period
 he
 neither
 ate
 nor
 drank
 There
 lived
 in
 that
 city
 a
 faithful
 disciple
 named
 Ananias
 to
 whom
 the
 Lord
 spake
 instructing
 him
 to
 visit
 Saul
 and
 minister
 unto
 him
 that
 he
 might
 be
 healed
 of
 his
 blindness
 Ananias
 was
 astonished
 at
 the
 commission
 and
 ventured
 to
 remind
 the
 Lord
 that
 Saul
 was
 a
 notorious
 persecutor
 of
 the
 saints
 and
 had
 come
 at
 that
 time
 to
 Damascus
 to
 arrest
 and
 put
 in
 bonds
 all
 believers
 But
 the
 Lord
 answered
 Go
 thy
 way
 for
 he
 is
 a
 chosen
 vessel
 unto
 me
 to
 bear
 my
 name
 before
 the
 Gentiles
 and
 kings
 and
 the
 children
 of
 Israel
 for
 I
 will
 shew
 him
 how
 great
 things
 he
 must
 suffer
 for
 my
 names
 sake
 Ananias
 went
 to
 Saul
 laid
 his
 hands
 upon
 the
 penitent
 sufferer
 saying
 Brother
 Saul
 the
 Lord
 even
 Jesus
 that
 appeared
 unto
 thee
 in
 the
 way
 as
 thou
 camest
 hath
 sent
 me
 that
 thou
 mightest
 receive
 thy
 sight
 and
 be
 filled
 with
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 The
 physical
 obstruction
 to
 vision
 was
 removed
 scaly
 particles
 fell
 from
 the
 eyes
 of
 Saul
 and
 his
 sight
 was
 restored
 Without
 delay
 or
 hesitation
 he
 was
 baptized
 When
 strengthened
 by
 food
 he
 communed
 with
 the
 disciples
 at
 Damascus
 and
 straightway
 began
 to
 preach
 in
 the
 synagogs
 declaring
 Jesus
 to
 be
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 When
 Saul
 returned
 to
 Jerusalem
 the
 disciples
 were
 doubtful
 of
 his
 sincerity
 they
 having
 known
 of
 him
 as
 a
 violent
 persecutor
 but
 Barnabas
 a
 trusted
 disciple
 brought
 him
 to
 the
 apostles
 told
 of
 his
 miraculous
 conversion
 and
 testified
 of
 his
 valiant
 service
 in
 preaching
 the
 word
 of
 God
 He
 was
 received
 into
 fellowship
 and
 afterward
 was
 ordained
 under
 the
 hands
 of
 the
 apostles
 His
 Hebrew
 name
 Saul
 was
 in
 time
 substituted
 by
 the
 Latin
 Paulus
 or
 as
 to
 us
 Paul
 In
 view
 of
 his
 commission
 to
 carry
 the
 Gospel
 to
 the
 Gentiles
 the
 use
 of
 his
 Roman
 name
 may
 have
 been
 of
 advantage
 and
 particularly
 so
 as
 he
 was
 a
 Roman
 citizen
 and
 therefore
 could
 claim
 the
 rights
 and
 exemptions
 attaching
 to
 the
 status
 of
 citizenship
 It
 is
 no
 part
 of
 our
 present
 purpose
 to
 follow
 even
 in
 outline
 the
 labors
 of
 the
 man
 thus
 peremptorily
 and
 miraculously
 called
 into
 the
 ministry
 the
 fact
 of
 Christs
 personal
 manifestations
 to
 him
 is
 the
 sole
 subject
 of
 present
 consideration
 While
 in
 Jerusalem
 Paul
 was
 blessed
 with
 a
 visual
 manifestation
 of
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 accompanied
 by
 the
 giving
 of
 specific
 instructions
 His
 own
 testimony
 is
 to
 this
 effect
 While
 I
 prayed
 in
 the
 temple
 I
 was
 in
 a
 trance
 and
 saw
 him
 saying
 unto
 me
 Make
 haste
 and
 get
 thee
 quickly
 out
 of
 Jerusalem
 for
 they
 will
 not
 receive
 thy
 testimony
 concerning
 me
 In
 explanation
 of
 his
 rejection
 by
 the
 people
 Paul
 confessed
 his
 evil
 past
 saying
 Lord
 they
 know
 that
 I
 imprisoned
 and
 beat
 in
 every
 synagogue
 them
 that
 believed
 on
 thee
 and
 when
 the
 blood
 of
 thy
 martyr
 Stephen
 was
 shed
 I
 also
 was
 standing
 by
 and
 consenting
 unto
 his
 death
 and
 kept
 the
 raiment
 of
 them
 that
 slew
 him
 To
 this
 the
 Lord
 replied
 Depart
 for
 I
 will
 send
 thee
 far
 hence
 unto
 the
 Gentiles
 Once
 again
 as
 he
 lay
 a
 prisoner
 in
 the
 Roman
 castle
 the
 Lord
 stood
 by
 him
 in
 the
 night
 and
 said
 Be
 of
 good
 cheer
 Paul
 for
 as
 thou
 hast
 testified
 of
 me
 in
 Jerusalem
 so
 must
 thou
 bear
 witness
 also
 at
 Rome
 Pauls
 personal
 witness
 that
 he
 had
 seen
 the
 resurrected
 Christ
 is
 explicit
 and
 emphatic
 With
 his
 enumeration
 of
 some
 of
 the
 risen
 Lords
 appearances
 he
 associates
 his
 own
 testimony
 as
 addressed
 to
 the
 Corinthian
 saints
 in
 this
 wise
 For
 I
 delivered
 unto
 you
 first
 of
 all
 that
 which
 I
 also
 received
 how
 that
 Christ
 died
 for
 our
 sins
 according
 to
 the
 scriptures
 and
 that
 he
 was
 buried
 and
 that
 he
 rose
 again
 the
 third
 day
 according
 to
 the
 scriptures
 and
 that
 he
 was
 seen
 of
 Cephas
 then
 of
 the
 Twelve
 after
 that
 he
 was
 seen
 of
 above
 five
 hundred
 brethren
 at
 once
 of
 whom
 the
 greater
 part
 remain
 unto
 this
 present
 but
 some
 are
 fallen
 asleep
 After
 that
 he
 was
 seen
 of
 James
 then
 of
 all
 the
 apostles
 And
 last
 of
 all
 he
 was
 seen
 of
 me
 also
 as
 of
 one

 CLOSE
 OF
 THE
 APOSTOLIC
 MINISTRYTHE
 REVELATION
 THROUGH
 JOHN
 The
 period
 of
 apostolic
 ministry
 continued
 until
 near
 the
 close
 of
 the
 first
 century
 of
 our
 era
 approximately
 sixty
 to
 seventy
 years
 from
 the
 time
 of
 the
 Lords
 ascension
 In
 the
 course
 of
 that
 epoch
 the
 Church
 experienced
 both
 prosperity
 and
 vicissitude
 At
 first
 the
 organized
 body
 increased
 in
 membership
 and
 influence
 in
 a
 manner
 regarded
 as
 phenomenal
 if
 not
 miraculous
 The
 apostles
 and
 the
 many
 other
 ministers
 who
 labored
 under
 their
 direction
 in
 graded
 positions
 of
 authority
 strove
 so
 effectively
 to
 spread
 the
 word
 of
 God
 that
 Paul
 writing
 approximately
 thirty
 years
 after
 the
 ascension
 affirmed
 that
 the
 gospel
 had
 already
 been
 carried
 to
 every
 nation
 or
 to
 use
 his
 words
 preached
 to
 every
 creature
 under
 heaven
 Through
 the
 agency
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 Christ
 continued
 to
 direct
 the
 affairs
 of
 His
 Church
 on
 the
 earth
 and
 His
 mortal
 representatives
 the
 apostles
 traveled
 and
 taught
 healed
 the
 afflicted
 rebuked
 evil
 spirits
 and
 raised
 the
 dead
 to
 a
 renewal
 of
 life
 We
 are
 without
 record
 of
 any
 direct
 or
 personal
 appearance
 of
 Christ
 to
 mortals
 between
 the
 manifestations
 to
 Paul
 and
 the
 revelation
 to
 John
 on
 the
 isle
 of
 Patmos
 Tradition
 confirms
 Johns
 implication
 that
 he
 had
 been
 banished
 thither
 for
 the
 word
 of
 God
 and
 for
 the
 testimony
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 He
 avers
 that
 what
 he
 wrote
 now
 known
 as
 the
 book
 of
 Revelation
 is
 The
 Revelation
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 which
 God
 gave
 unto
 him
 to
 shew
 unto
 his
 servants
 things
 which
 must
 shortly
 come
 to
 pass
 and
 he
 sent
 and
 signified
 it
 by
 his
 angel
 unto
 his
 servant
 John
 The
 apostle
 gives
 a
 vivid
 description
 of
 the
 glorified
 Christ
 as
 seen
 by
 him
 and
 of
 the
 Lords
 words
 he
 made
 record
 as
 follows
 Fear
 not
 I
 am
 the
 first
 and
 the
 last
 I
 am
 he
 that
 liveth
 and
 was
 dead
 and
 behold
 I
 am
 alive
 for
 evermore
 Amen
 and
 have
 the
 keys
 of
 hell
 and
 of
 death
 John
 was
 commanded
 to
 write
 to
 each
 of
 the
 seven
 churches
 or
 branches
 of
 the
 Church
 of
 Christ
 then
 existing
 in
 Asia
 administering
 reproof
 admonition
 and
 encouragement
 as
 the
 condition
 of
 each
 required
 The
 final
 ministry
 of
 John
 marked
 the
 close
 of
 the
 apostolic
 administration
 in
 the
 Primitive
 Church
 His
 fellow
 apostles
 had
 gone
 to
 their
 rest
 most
 of
 them
 having
 entered
 through
 the
 gates
 of
 martyrdom
 and
 although
 it
 was
 his
 special
 privilege
 to
 tarry
 in
 the
 flesh
 until
 the
 Lords
 advent
 in
 glory
 he
 was
 not
 to
 continue
 his
 service
 as
 an
 acknowledged
 minister
 known
 to
 and
 accepted
 by
 the
 Church
 Even
 while
 many
 of
 the
 apostles
 lived
 and
 labored
 the
 seed
 of
 apostasy
 had
 taken
 root
 in
 the
 Church
 and
 had
 grown
 with
 the
 rankness
 of
 pernicious
 weeds
 This
 condition
 had
 been
 predicted
 both
 by
 Old
 Testament
 prophets
 and
 by
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 The
 apostles
 also
 spake
 in
 plain
 prediction
 of
 the
 growth
 of
 the
 apostasy
 all
 too
 grievously
 apparent
 to
 them
 as
 then
 in
 progress
 Personal
 manifestations
 of
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 to
 mortals
 appear
 to
 have
 ceased
 with
 the
 passing
 of
 the
 apostles
 of
 old
 and
 were
 not
 again
 witnessed
 until
 the
 dawn
 of
 the
 Dispensation
 of
 the
 Fulness
 of
 Times
 NOTES

 CHAPTER
 
 
 Presiding
 Authority
 and
 Common
 ConsentAnother
 instance
 of
 official
 action
 in
 choosing
 and
 setting
 apart
 men
 to
 special
 office
 in
 the
 Church
 arose
 soon
 after
 the
 ordination
 of
 Matthias
 It
 appears
 that
 one
 feature
 of
 the
 Church
 organization
 in
 early
 apostolic
 days
 was
 a
 common
 ownership
 of
 material
 things
 distribution
 being
 made
 according
 to
 need
 As
 the
 members
 increased
 it
 was
 found
 impracticable
 for
 the
 apostles
 to
 devote
 the
 necessary
 attention
 and
 time
 to
 these
 temporal
 matters
 so
 they
 called
 upon
 the
 members
 to
 select
 seven
 men
 of
 honest
 report
 whom
 the
 apostles
 would
 appoint
 to
 take
 special
 charge
 of
 these
 affairs
 These
 men
 were
 set
 apart
 by
 prayer
 and
 by
 the
 laying
 on
 of
 hands
 The
 instance
 is
 instructive
 as
 showing
 that
 the
 apostles
 realized
 their
 possession
 of
 authority
 to
 direct
 in
 the
 affairs
 of
 the
 Church
 and
 that
 they
 observed
 with
 strictness
 the
 principle
 of
 common
 consent
 in
 the
 administration
 of
 their
 high
 office
 They
 exercized
 their
 priestly
 powers
 in
 the
 spirit
 of
 love
 and
 with
 due
 regard
 to
 the
 rights
 of
 the
 people
 over
 whom
 they
 were
 placed
 to
 presideThe

 PentecostThe
 name
 means
 fiftieth
 and
 was
 applied
 to
 the
 Jewish
 feast
 that
 was
 celebrated
 fifty
 days
 after
 the
 second
 day
 of
 unleavened
 bread
 or
 the
 Passover
 day
 It
 is
 also
 known
 as
 the
 feast
 of
 weeks
 Exo
 
 Deut
 
 because
 according
 to
 the
 Hebrew
 style
 it
 fell
 seven
 weeks
 or
 a
 week
 of
 weeks
 after
 the
 Passover
 as
 the
 feast
 of
 harvest
 Exo
 
 and
 as
 the
 day
 of
 the
 firstfruits
 Numb
 
 Pentecost
 was
 one
 of
 the
 great
 feasts
 in
 Israel
 and
 was
 of
 mandatory
 observance
 Special
 sacrifices
 were
 appointed
 for
 the
 day
 as
 was
 also
 an
 offering
 suitable
 to
 the
 harvest
 season
 comprizing
 two
 leavened
 loaves
 made
 of
 the
 new
 wheat
 these
 were
 to
 be
 waved
 before
 the
 altar
 and
 then
 given
 to
 the
 priests
 Lev
 
 Because
 of
 the
 unprecedented
 events
 that
 characterized
 the
 first
 Pentecost
 after
 our
 Lords
 ascension
 the
 name
 has
 become
 current
 in
 Christian
 literature
 as
 expressive
 of
 any
 great
 spiritual
 awakening
 or
 unusual
 manifestation
 of
 divine
 grace
 
 Having
 All
 Things
 in
 CommonNo
 condition
 recorded
 of
 the
 early
 apostolic
 ministry
 expresses
 more
 forcefully
 the
 unity
 and
 devotion
 of
 the
 Church
 in
 those
 days
 than
 does
 the
 fact
 of
 the
 members
 establishing
 a
 system
 of
 common
 ownership
 of
 property
 Acts
 
 
 
 
 One
 result
 of
 this
 community
 of
 interest
 in
 temporal
 things
 was
 a
 marked
 unity
 in
 spiritual
 matters
 they
 were
 of
 one
 heart
 and
 of
 one
 soul
 Lacking
 nothing
 they
 lived
 in
 contentment
 and
 godliness
 Over
 thirty
 centuries
 earlier
 the
 people
 of
 Enoch
 had
 rejoiced
 in
 a
 similar
 condition
 of
 oneness
 and
 their
 attainments
 in
 spiritual
 excellence
 were
 so
 effective
 that
 the
 Lord
 came
 and
 dwelt
 with
 his
 people
 
 And
 the
 Lord
 called
 his
 people
 Zion
 because
 they
 were
 of
 one
 heart
 and
 one
 mind
 and
 dwelt
 in
 righteousness
 and
 there
 was
 no
 poor
 among
 them

 Sauls
 ConversionThe
 sudden
 change
 of
 heart
 by
 which
 an
 ardent
 persecutor
 of
 the
 saints
 was
 so
 transformed
 as
 to
 become
 a
 true
 disciple
 is
 to
 the
 average
 mind
 a
 miracle
 Saul
 of
 Tarsus
 was
 a
 devoted
 student
 and
 observer
 of
 the
 law
 a
 strict
 Pharisee
 We
 find
 no
 intimation
 that
 he
 ever
 met
 or
 saw
 Jesus
 during
 the
 Lords
 life
 in
 the
 flesh
 and
 his
 contact
 with
 the
 Christian
 movement
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 brought
 about
 through
 disputation
 with
 Stephen
 In
 determining
 what
 he
 would
 call
 right
 and
 what
 wrong
 the
 young
 enthusiast
 was
 guided
 too
 much
 by
 mind
 and
 too
 little
 by
 heart
 His
 learning
 which
 should
 have
 been
 his
 servant
 was
 instead
 his
 master
 He
 was
 a
 leading
 spirit
 in
 the
 cruel
 persecution
 of
 the
 first
 converts
 to
 Christianity
 yet
 none
 can
 doubt
 his
 belief
 that
 even
 in
 such
 he
 was
 rendering
 service
 to
 Jehovah
 compare
 John
 
 His
 unusual
 energy
 and
 superb
 ability
 were
 misdirected
 As
 soon
 as
 he
 realized
 the
 error
 of
 his
 course
 he
 turned
 about
 without
 counting
 risk
 cost
 or
 the
 certainty
 of
 persecution
 and
 probable
 martyrdom
 His
 repentance
 was
 as
 genuine
 as
 had
 been
 his
 persecuting
 zeal
 All
 through
 his
 ministry
 he
 was
 tortured
 by
 the
 past
 Acts

 yet
 he
 found
 a
 measure

 relief
 in

 knowledge

 was

 him

 He
 was
 preeminently

 apostle
 to

 and
 this
 opening
 of
 the
 doors
 to
 others
 than
 Jews
 was
 the
 main
 contention
 between
 himself
 and
 Stephen
 In
 accordance
 with
 the
 divine
 and
 fateful
 purpose
 Paul
 was
 called
 to
 do
 the
 work
 in
 opposition
 to
 which
 he
 had
 been
 a
 participant
 in
 the
 martyrdom
 of
 Stephen
 At
 the
 Lords
 word
 of
 direction
 Paul
 was
 ready
 to
 preach
 Christ
 to

 by

 says
 Thus

 influence

 the
 doctrine
 of
 the
 Savior
 like

 rays

 quickly
 irradiated

 Presently
 in

 prophecy
 the

 A

 island

 group
 now

 It
 is
 characterized
 by
 an
 indented
 coast
 and
 has
 a

 The
 Holy
 Ghost
 GivenIn
 answer
 to
 a
 question
 as
 to
 whether
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 was
 received
 by
 the
 apostles
 at
 or
 before
 Pentecost
 a
 statement
 was
 published
 by
 the
 First
 Presidency
 of
 the
 Church
 on
 February
 
 
 see
 Deseret
 News
 of
 that
 date
 from
 which
 statement
 the
 following
 excerpts
 are
 taken
 The
 answer
 to
 this
 question
 depends
 upon
 what
 is
 meant
 by
 receiving
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 If
 reference
 is
 made
 to
 the
 promise
 of
 Jesus
 to
 His
 apostles
 about
 the
 endowment
 or
 gift
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 by
 the
 presence
 and
 ministration
 of
 the
 personage
 of
 Spirit
 called
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 by
 revelation
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 then
 the
 answer
 is
 it
 was
 not
 until
 the
 day
 of
 Pentecost
 that
 the
 promise
 was
 fulfilled
 But
 the
 divine
 essence
 called
 the
 Spirit
 of
 God
 or
 Holy
 Spirit
 or
 Holy
 Ghost
 by
 which
 God
 created
 or
 organized
 all
 things
 and
 by
 which
 the
 prophets
 wrote
 and
 spoke
 was
 bestowed
 in
 former
 ages
 and
 inspired
 the
 apostles
 in
 their
 ministry
 long
 before
 the
 day
 of
 Pentecost
 We
 read
 that
 Jesus
 after
 His
 resurrection
 breathed
 upon
 His
 disciples
 and
 said
 Receive
 ye
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 But
 we
 also
 read
 that
 He
 said
 Behold
 I
 send
 the
 promise
 of
 my
 Father
 upon
 you
 but
 tarry
 ye
 in
 the
 city
 of
 Jerusalem
 until
 ye
 be
 endued
 with
 power
 from
 on
 high
 John
 
 Luke
 
 We
 read
 further
 For
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 was
 not
 yet
 given
 because
 that
 Jesus
 was
 not
 yet
 glorified
 John
 
 Thus
 the
 promise
 was
 made
 but
 the
 fulfilment
 came
 after
 so
 that
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 sent
 by
 Jesus
 from
 the
 Father
 did
 not
 come
 in
 person
 until
 the
 day
 of
 Pentecost
 and
 the
 cloven
 tongues
 of
 fire
 were
 the
 sign
 of
 His
 coming

 CHAPTER
 
 MINISTRY
 OF
 THE
 RESURRECTED
 CHRIST
 ON
 THE
 WESTERN
 HEMISPHERE
 By
 considering
 the
 apostolic
 ministry
 in
 immediate
 sequence
 to
 our
 study
 of
 the
 Lords
 ascension
 from
 the
 Mount
 of
 Olives
 we
 have
 departed
 from
 the
 chronological
 order
 of
 the
 several
 personal
 manifestations
 of
 the
 risen
 Savior
 to
 mortals
 for
 very
 soon
 after
 His
 final
 farewell
 to
 the
 apostles
 in
 Judea
 He
 visited
 His
 other
 sheep
 not
 of
 the
 eastern
 fold
 whose
 existence
 He
 had
 affirmed
 in
 that
 impressive
 sermon
 concerning
 the
 Good
 Shepherd
 and
 His
 sheep
 Those
 other
 sheep
 who
 were
 to
 hear
 the
 Shepherds
 voice
 and
 eventually
 be
 made
 part
 of
 the
 united
 fold
 were
 the
 descendants
 of
 Lehi
 who
 with
 his
 family
 and
 a
 few
 others
 had
 left
 Jerusalem
 
 BC
 and
 had
 crossed
 the
 great
 deep
 to
 what
 we
 now
 know
 as
 the
 American
 continent
 whereon
 they
 had
 grown
 to
 be
 a
 mighty
 though
 a
 divided
 people
 THE
 LORDS
 DEATH
 SIGNALIZED
 BY
 GREAT
 CALAMITIES
 ON
 THE
 AMERICAN
 CONTINENT
 As
 already
 set
 forth
 in
 these
 pages
 the
 birth
 of
 Jesus
 at
 Bethlehem
 had
 been
 made
 known
 to
 the
 Nephite
 nation
 on
 the
 western
 hemisphere
 by
 divine
 revelation
 and
 the
 glad
 event
 had
 been
 marked
 by
 the
 appearance
 of
 a
 new
 star
 by
 a
 night
 devoid
 of
 darkness
 so
 that
 two
 days
 and
 the
 night
 between
 had
 been
 as
 one
 day
 and
 by
 other
 wonderful
 occurrences
 all
 of
 which
 had
 been
 predicted
 through
 the
 prophets
 of
 the
 western
 world
 Samuel
 the
 Lamanite
 who
 through
 faithfulness
 and
 good
 works
 had
 become
 a
 prophet
 mighty
 in
 word
 and
 deed
 duly
 chosen
 and
 commissioned
 of
 God
 had
 coupled
 with
 his
 predictions
 of
 the
 glorious
 occurrences
 that
 were
 to
 mark
 the
 birth
 of
 Christ
 prophecies
 of
 other
 signsof
 darkness
 terror
 and
 destructionby
 which
 the
 Saviors
 death
 on
 the
 cross
 would
 be
 signalized
 Every
 prophetic
 word
 concerning
 the
 phenomena
 that
 were
 to
 attend
 the
 Lords
 birth
 had
 been
 fulfilled
 and
 many
 people
 had
 been
 brought
 thereby
 to
 believe
 in
 Christ
 as
 the
 promised
 Redeemer
 but
 as
 is
 usual
 with
 those
 whose
 belief
 rests
 on
 miracles
 many
 among
 the
 Nephites
 began
 to
 forget
 those
 signs
 and
 wonders
 which
 they
 had
 heard
 and
 began
 to
 be
 less
 and
 less
 astonished
 at
 a
 sign
 or
 a
 wonder
 from
 heaven
 insomuch
 that
 they
 began
 to
 be
 hard
 in
 their
 hearts
 and
 blind
 in
 their
 minds
 and
 began
 to
 disbelieve
 all
 which
 they
 had
 heard
 and
 seen
 Thirty
 and
 three
 years
 had
 sped
 their
 course
 since
 the
 illumined
 night
 and
 the
 other
 signs
 of
 Messiahs
 advent
 then
 on
 the
 fourth
 day
 of
 the
 first
 month
 or
 according
 to
 our
 calendar
 during
 the
 first
 week
 of
 April
 in
 the
 thirtyfourth
 year
 there
 arose
 a
 great
 and
 terrible
 tempest
 with
 thunderings
 lightnings
 and
 both
 elevations
 and
 depressions
 of
 the
 earths
 surface
 so
 that
 the
 highways
 were
 broken
 up
 mountains
 were
 sundered
 and
 many
 cities
 were
 utterly
 destroyed
 by
 earthquake
 fire
 and
 the
 inrush
 of
 the
 sea
 For
 three
 hours
 the
 unprecedented
 holocaust
 continued
 and
 then
 thick
 darkness
 fell
 in
 the
 which
 it
 was
 found
 impossible
 to
 kindle
 a
 fire
 the
 awful
 gloom
 was
 like
 unto
 the
 darkness
 of
 Egypt
 in
 that
 its
 clammy
 vapors
 could
 be
 felt
 This
 condition
 lasted
 until
 the
 third
 day
 so
 that
 a
 night
 a
 day
 and
 a
 night
 were
 as
 one
 unbroken
 night
 and
 the
 impenetrable
 blackness
 was
 rendered
 the
 more
 terrible
 by
 the
 wailing
 of
 the
 people
 whose
 heartrending
 refrain
 was
 everywhere
 the
 same
 O
 that
 we
 had
 repented
 before
 this
 great
 and
 terrible
 day
 Then
 piercing
 the
 darkness
 came
 a
 Voice
 before
 which
 the
 frightful
 chorus
 of
 human
 lamentation
 was
 silenced
 Wo
 wo
 wo
 unto
 this
 people
 resounded
 throughout
 the
 land
 The
 Voice
 proclaimed
 increasing
 woes
 except
 the
 people
 should
 repent
 Destruction
 had
 befallen
 because
 of
 wickedness
 and
 the
 devil
 was
 then
 laughing
 over
 the
 number
 of
 the
 dead
 and
 the
 retributive
 cause
 of
 their
 destruction
 The
 extent
 of
 the
 dread
 calamity
 was
 detailed
 cities
 that
 had
 been
 burned
 with
 their
 inhabitants
 others
 that
 had
 sunk
 into
 the
 sea
 yet
 others
 buried
 in
 the
 earth
 were
 enumerated
 and
 the
 divine
 reason
 for
 this
 widespread
 destruction
 was
 plainly
 set
 forththat
 the
 wickedness
 and
 abominations
 of
 the
 people
 might
 be
 hidden
 from
 the
 face
 of
 the
 earth
 Those
 who
 had
 lived
 to
 hear
 were
 declared
 to
 be
 the
 more
 righteous
 of
 the
 inhabitants
 and
 to
 them
 hope
 was
 offered
 on
 conditions
 of
 more
 thorough
 repentance
 and
 reformation
 The
 identity
 of
 the
 Voice
 was
 thus
 made
 known
 Behold
 I
 am
 Jesus
 Christ
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 I
 created
 the
 heavens
 and
 the
 earth
 and
 all
 things
 that
 in
 them
 are
 I
 was
 with
 the
 Father
 from
 the
 beginning
 I
 am
 in
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Father
 in
 me
 and
 in
 me
 hath
 the
 Father
 glorified
 his
 name
 The
 Lord
 commanded
 that
 the
 people
 should
 no
 longer
 serve
 Him
 with
 bloody
 sacrifices
 and
 burnt
 offerings
 for
 the
 law
 of
 Moses
 was
 fulfilled
 and
 thenceforth
 the
 only
 acceptable
 sacrifice
 would
 be
 the
 broken
 heart
 and
 the
 contrite
 spirit
 and
 such
 should
 never
 be
 rejected
 The
 humble
 and
 repentant
 the
 Lord
 would
 receive
 as
 His
 own
 Behold
 He
 said
 for
 such
 I
 have
 laid
 down
 my
 life
 and
 have
 taken
 it
 up
 again
 therefore
 repent
 and
 come
 unto
 me
 ye
 ends
 of
 the
 earth
 and
 be
 saved
 The
 Voice
 ceased
 and
 through
 the
 space
 of
 many
 hours
 of
 continuing
 darkness
 vociferous
 lamentations
 were
 hushed
 for
 the
 people
 were
 convicted
 of
 their
 guilt
 and
 silently
 wept
 in
 astonishment
 over
 what
 they
 had
 heard
 and
 in
 hopeful
 anticipation
 of
 the
 salvation
 that
 had
 been
 offered
 A
 second
 time
 the
 Voice
 was
 heard
 as
 in
 sorrow
 over
 those
 who
 had
 refused
 to
 accept
 the
 Saviors
 succor
 for
 often
 had
 He
 protected
 them
 more
 often
 would
 He
 have
 so
 done
 had
 they
 been
 willing
 and
 yet
 in
 the
 future
 would
 He
 cherish
 them
 as
 a
 hen
 gathereth
 her
 chickens
 under
 her
 wings
 if
 they
 would
 repent
 and
 live
 in
 righteousness
 On
 the
 morning
 of
 the
 third
 day
 the
 darkness
 dispersed
 seismic
 disturbances
 ceased
 and
 the
 storms
 abated
 As
 the
 pall
 was
 lifted
 from
 the
 land
 the
 people
 saw
 how
 profound
 had
 been
 the
 convulsions
 of
 earth
 and
 how
 great
 had
 been
 their
 loss
 of
 kindred
 and
 friends
 In
 their
 contrition
 and
 humiliation
 they
 remembered
 the
 predictions
 of
 the
 prophets
 and
 knew
 that
 the
 mandate
 of
 the
 Lord
 had
 been
 executed
 upon
 them
 Christ
 had
 risen
 and
 following
 Him
 many
 of
 the
 righteous
 dead
 on
 the
 western
 continent
 rose
 from
 their
 graves
 and
 appeared
 as
 resurrected
 immortalized
 beings
 among
 the
 survivors
 of
 the
 landwide
 destruction
 even
 as
 in
 Judea
 many
 of
 the
 saints
 had
 been
 raised
 immediately
 after
 the
 resurrection
 of
 Christ
 FIRST
 VISITATION
 OF
 JESUS
 CHRIST
 TO
 THE
 NEPHITES
 About
 six
 weeks
 or
 more
 after
 the
 events
 last
 considered
 a
 great
 multitude
 of
 the
 Nephites
 had
 assembled
 at
 the
 temple
 in
 the
 land
 called
 Bountiful
 and
 were
 earnestly
 discoursing
 with
 one
 another
 over
 the
 great
 changes
 that
 had
 been
 wrought
 in
 the
 land
 and
 particularly
 concerning
 Jesus
 Christ
 of
 whose
 atoning
 death
 the
 predicted
 signs
 had
 been
 witnessed
 in
 all
 their
 tragic
 details
 The
 prevailing
 spirit
 of
 the
 assembly
 was
 that
 of
 contrition
 and
 reverence
 While
 thus
 congregated
 they
 heard
 a
 sound
 as
 of
 a
 Voice
 from
 above
 but
 both
 a
 first
 and
 a
 second
 utterance
 were
 to
 them
 unintelligible
 As
 they
 listened
 with
 rapt
 intentness
 the
 Voice
 was
 heard
 a
 third
 time
 and
 it
 said
 unto
 them
 Behold
 my
 beloved
 Son
 in
 whom
 I
 am
 well
 pleased
 in
 whom
 I
 have
 glorified
 my
 name
 hear
 ye
 him
 While
 gazing
 upward
 in
 reverent
 expectation
 the
 people
 beheld
 a
 Man
 clothed
 in
 a
 white
 robe
 who
 descended
 and
 stood
 among
 them
 He
 spake
 saying
 Behold
 I
 am
 Jesus
 Christ
 whom
 the
 prophets
 testified
 shall
 come
 into
 the
 world
 and
 behold
 I
 am
 the
 light
 and
 the
 life
 of
 the
 world
 and
 I
 have
 drunk
 out
 of
 that
 bitter
 cup
 which
 the
 Father
 hath
 given
 me
 and
 have
 glorified
 the
 Father
 in
 taking
 upon
 me
 the
 sins
 of
 the
 world
 in
 the
 which
 I
 have
 suffered
 the
 will
 of
 the
 Father
 in
 all
 things
 from
 the
 beginning
 The
 multitude
 prostrated
 themselves
 in
 adoration
 for
 they
 remembered
 that
 their
 prophets
 had
 foretold
 that
 the
 Lord
 would
 appear
 among
 them
 after
 His
 resurrection
 and
 ascension
 As
 He
 directed
 the
 people
 arose
 and
 one
 by
 one
 came
 to
 Him
 and
 did
 see
 and
 feel
 the
 prints
 of
 the
 nails
 in
 His
 hands
 and
 feet
 and
 the
 spearwound
 in
 His
 side
 Moved
 to
 adoring
 utterance
 with
 one
 accord
 they
 cried
 Hosanna
 blessed
 be
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Most
 High
 God
 then
 falling
 at
 the
 feet
 of
 Jesus
 they
 worshiped
 Him
 Summoning
 Nephi
 and
 eleven
 others
 to
 approach
 the
 Lord
 gave
 them
 authority
 to
 baptize
 the
 people
 after
 His
 departure
 and
 prescribed
 the
 mode
 of
 baptism
 with
 particular
 injunction
 against
 disputation
 in
 the
 matter
 or
 alteration
 of
 the
 given
 form
 as
 witness
 the
 Lords
 words
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 that
 whoso
 repenteth
 of
 his
 sins
 through
 your
 words
 and
 desireth
 to
 be
 baptized
 in
 my
 name
 on
 this
 wise
 shall
 ye
 baptize
 them
 behold
 ye
 shall
 go
 down
 and
 stand
 in
 the
 water
 and
 in
 my
 name
 shall
 ye
 baptize
 them
 And
 now
 behold
 these
 are
 the
 words
 which
 ye
 shall
 say
 calling
 them
 by
 name
 saying
 Having
 authority
 given
 me
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 I
 baptize
 you
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Father
 and
 of
 the
 Son
 and
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 Amen
 And
 then
 shall
 ye
 immerse
 them
 in
 the
 water
 and
 come
 forth
 again
 out
 of
 the
 water
 And
 after
 this
 manner
 shall
 ye
 baptize
 in
 my
 name
 for
 behold
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 that
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Son
 and
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 are
 one
 and
 I
 am
 in
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Father
 in
 me
 and
 the
 Father
 and
 I
 are
 one
 And
 according
 as
 I
 have
 commanded
 you
 thus
 shall
 ye
 baptize
 And
 there
 shall
 be
 no
 disputations
 among
 you
 as
 there
 hath
 hitherto
 been
 neither
 shall
 there
 be
 disputations
 among
 you
 concerning
 the
 points
 of
 my
 doctrine
 as
 there
 hath
 hitherto
 been
 The
 people
 in
 general
 and
 particularly
 the
 Twelve
 chosen
 as
 stated
 were
 impressively
 warned
 against
 contention
 over
 matters
 of
 doctrine
 the
 spirit
 of
 which
 was
 declared
 to
 be
 of
 the
 devil
 who
 is
 the
 father
 of
 contention
 The
 doctrine
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 set
 forth
 in
 simple
 yet
 comprehensive
 summary
 in
 these
 words
 Behold
 verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 I
 will
 declare
 unto
 you
 my
 doctrine
 And
 this
 is
 my
 doctrine
 and
 it
 is
 the
 doctrine
 which
 the
 Father
 hath
 given
 unto
 me
 and
 I
 bear
 record
 of
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Father
 beareth
 record
 of
 me
 and
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 beareth
 record
 of
 the
 Father
 and
 me
 and
 I
 bear
 record
 that
 the
 Father
 commandeth
 all
 men
 everywhere
 to
 repent
 and
 believe
 in
 me
 And
 whoso
 believeth
 in
 me
 and
 is
 baptized
 the
 same
 shall
 be
 saved
 and
 they
 are
 they
 who
 shall
 inherit
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 And
 whoso
 believeth
 not
 in
 me
 and
 is
 not
 baptized
 shall
 be
 damned
 Repentance
 and
 humility
 akin
 to
 that
 of
 the
 innocent
 trusting
 child
 were
 the
 prerequisites
 for
 baptism
 without
 which
 none
 could
 inherit
 the
 kingdom
 of
 God
 With
 the
 incisiveness
 and
 simplicity
 that
 had
 characterized
 His
 teachings
 in
 Palestine
 the
 Lord
 thus
 instructed
 His
 newly
 chosen
 Twelve
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 that
 this
 is
 my
 doctrine
 and
 whoso
 buildeth
 upon
 this
 buildeth
 upon
 my
 rock
 and
 the
 gates
 of
 hell
 shall
 not
 prevail
 against
 them
 And
 whoso
 shall
 declare
 more
 or
 less
 than
 this
 and
 establish
 it
 for
 my
 doctrine
 the
 same
 cometh
 of
 evil
 and
 is
 not
 built
 upon
 my
 rock
 but
 he
 buildeth
 upon
 a
 sandy
 foundation
 and
 the
 gates
 of
 hell
 standeth
 open
 to
 receive
 such
 when
 the
 floods
 come
 and
 the
 winds
 beat
 upon
 them
 Therefore
 go
 forth
 unto
 this
 people
 and
 declare
 the
 words
 which
 I
 have
 spoken
 unto
 the
 ends
 of
 the
 earth
 Then
 turning
 to
 the
 multitude
 Jesus
 admonished
 them
 to
 give
 heed
 to
 the
 teachings
 of
 the
 Twelve
 and
 continued
 with
 a
 discourse
 embodying
 the
 sublime
 principles
 He
 had
 taught
 among
 the
 Jews
 in
 the
 Sermon
 on
 the
 Mount
 The
 Beatitudes
 the
 Lords
 Prayer
 and
 the
 same
 splendid
 array
 of
 ennobling
 precepts
 are
 set
 forth
 and
 the
 same
 wealth
 of
 effective
 comparison
 and
 apt
 illustration
 appear
 in
 both
 Matthews
 and
 Nephis
 versions
 of
 this
 unparalleled
 address
 but
 a
 significant
 difference
 is
 observed
 in
 every
 reference
 to
 the
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 Mosaic
 law
 for
 where
 the
 Jewish
 scriptures
 record
 the
 Lords
 words
 as
 pointing
 to
 a
 fulfilment
 then
 incomplete
 the
 corresponding
 expressions
 in
 the
 Nephite
 account
 are
 in
 the
 past
 tense
 the
 law
 having
 been
 already
 fulfilled
 in
 its
 entirety
 through
 the
 death
 and
 resurrection
 of
 Christ
 Thus
 to
 the
 Jews
 Jesus
 had
 said
 Till
 heaven
 and
 earth
 pass
 one
 jot
 or
 one
 tittle
 shall
 in
 no
 wise
 pass
 from
 the
 law
 till
 all
 be
 fulfilled
 but
 to
 the
 Nephites
 For
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 one
 jot
 nor
 one
 tittle
 hath
 not
 passed
 away
 from
 the
 law
 but
 in
 me
 it
 hath
 all
 been
 fulfilled
 Many
 marveled
 over
 this
 matter
 wondering
 what
 the
 Lord
 would
 have
 them
 do
 concerning
 the
 law
 of
 Moses
 for
 they
 understood
 not
 the
 saying
 that
 old
 things
 had
 passed
 away
 and
 that
 all
 things
 had
 become
 new
 Jesus
 conscious
 of
 their
 perplexity
 proclaimed
 in
 plainness
 that
 He
 was
 the
 Giver
 of
 the
 law
 and
 that
 by
 Him
 had
 it
 been
 fulfilled
 and
 therefore
 abrogated
 His
 affirmation
 is
 particularly
 explicit
 Behold
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 that
 the
 law
 is
 fulfilled
 that
 was
 given
 unto
 Moses
 Behold
 I
 am
 he
 that
 gave
 the
 law
 and
 I
 am
 he
 who
 covenanted
 with
 my
 people
 Israel
 therefore
 the
 law
 in
 me
 is
 fulfilled
 for
 I
 have
 come
 to
 fulfil
 the
 law
 therefore
 it
 hath
 an
 end
 Behold
 I
 do
 not
 destroy
 the
 prophets
 for
 as
 many
 as
 have
 not
 been
 fulfilled
 in
 me
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 shall
 all
 be
 fulfilled
 And
 because
 I
 said
 unto
 you
 that
 old
 things
 hath
 passed
 away
 I
 do
 not
 destroy
 that
 which
 hath
 been
 spoken
 concerning
 things
 which
 are
 to
 come
 For
 behold
 the
 covenant
 which
 I
 have
 made
 with
 my
 people
 is
 not
 all
 fulfilled
 but
 the
 law
 which
 was
 given
 unto
 Moses
 hath
 an
 end
 in
 me
 Addressing
 Himself
 to
 the
 Twelve
 He
 affirmed
 that
 never
 had
 the
 Father
 commanded
 Him
 to
 inform
 the
 Jews
 concerning
 the
 existence
 of
 the
 Nephites
 except
 indirectly
 by
 mention
 of
 other
 sheep
 not
 of
 the
 Jewish
 fold
 and
 as
 because
 of
 stiffneckedness
 and
 unbelief
 they
 had
 failed
 to
 comprehend
 His
 words
 the
 Father
 had
 commanded
 Him
 to
 say
 no
 more
 with
 reference
 either
 to
 the
 Nephites
 or
 to
 the
 third
 foldcomprizing
 the
 other
 tribes
 of
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 whom
 the
 Father
 hath
 led
 away
 out
 of
 the
 land
 To
 the
 Nephite
 disciples
 Jesus
 taught
 many
 other
 matters
 that
 had
 been
 withheld
 from
 the
 Jews
 who
 through
 unfitness
 to
 receive
 had
 been
 left
 in
 ignorance
 Even
 the
 Jewish
 apostles
 had
 wrongly
 supposed
 that
 those
 other
 sheep
 were
 the
 Gentile
 nations
 not
 realizing
 that
 the
 carrying
 of
 the
 gospel
 to
 the
 Gentiles
 was
 part
 of
 their
 particular
 mission
 and
 oblivious
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 never
 would
 Christ
 manifest
 Himself
 in
 person
 to
 those
 who
 were
 not
 of
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 Through
 the
 promptings
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 and
 under
 the
 ministrations
 of
 men
 commissioned
 and
 sent
 would
 the
 Gentiles
 hear
 the
 word
 of
 God
 but
 to
 the
 personal
 manifestation
 of
 the
 Messiah
 they
 were
 ineligible
 Great
 however
 will
 be
 the
 Lords
 mercies
 and
 blessings
 to
 the
 Gentiles
 who
 accept
 the
 truth
 for
 unto
 them
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 shall
 bear
 witness
 of
 the
 Father
 and
 of
 the
 Son
 and
 all
 of
 them
 who
 comply
 with
 the
 laws
 and
 ordinances
 of
 the
 gospel
 shall
 be
 numbered
 in
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 Their
 conversion
 and
 enfoldment
 with
 the
 Lords
 own
 will
 be
 as
 individuals
 and
 not
 as
 nations
 tribes
 or
 peoples
 The
 adoring
 multitude
 numbering
 about
 two
 thousand
 five
 hundred
 souls
 thought
 that
 Jesus
 was
 about
 to
 depart
 and
 they
 tearfully
 yearned
 to
 have
 Him
 remain
 He
 comforted
 them
 with
 the
 assurance
 that
 He
 would
 return
 on
 the
 morrow
 and
 admonished
 them
 to
 ponder
 upon
 the
 things
 He
 had
 taught
 and
 to
 pray
 in
 His
 name
 to
 the
 Father
 for
 understanding
 He
 had
 already
 informed
 the
 Twelve
 and
 now
 stated
 to
 the
 people
 that
 He
 would
 show
 Himself
 and
 minister
 unto
 the
 lost
 tribes
 of
 Israel
 for
 they
 are
 not
 lost
 unto
 the
 Father
 for
 he
 knoweth
 whither
 he
 hath
 taken
 them
 Voicing
 the
 compassion
 He
 felt
 the
 Lord
 directed
 the
 people
 to
 fetch
 their
 afflicted
 ones
 the
 lame
 halt
 maimed
 blind
 and
 deaf
 the
 leprous
 and
 the
 withered
 and
 when
 these
 were
 brought
 He
 healed
 them
 every
 one
 Then
 as
 He
 commanded
 parents
 brought
 their
 little
 children
 and
 placed
 them
 in
 a
 circle
 around
 Him
 The
 multitude
 bowed
 in
 prayer
 and
 Jesus
 prayed
 for
 them
 And
 wrote
 Nephi
 no
 tongue
 can
 speak
 neither
 can
 there
 be
 written
 by
 any
 man
 neither
 can
 the
 hearts
 of
 men
 conceive
 so
 great
 and
 marvellous
 things
 as
 we
 both
 saw
 and
 heard
 Jesus
 speak
 and
 no
 one
 can
 conceive
 of
 the
 joy
 which
 filled
 our
 souls
 at
 the
 time
 we
 heard
 him
 pray
 for
 us
 unto
 the
 Father
 The
 prayer
 being
 ended
 Jesus
 bade
 the
 multitude
 arise
 and
 joyfully
 He
 exclaimed
 Blessed
 are
 ye
 because
 of
 your
 faith
 And
 now
 behold
 my
 joy
 is
 full
 Jesus
 wept
 Then
 He
 took
 the
 children
 one
 by
 one
 and
 blessed
 them
 praying
 unto
 the
 Father
 for
 each
 And
 when
 he
 had
 done
 this
 he
 wept
 again
 and
 he
 spake
 unto
 the
 multitude
 and
 saith
 unto
 them
 behold
 your
 little
 ones
 And
 as
 they
 looked
 to
 behold
 they
 cast
 their
 eyes
 towards
 heaven
 and
 they
 saw
 the
 heavens
 open
 and
 they
 saw
 angels
 descending
 out
 of
 heaven
 as
 it
 were
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 fire
 and
 they
 came
 down
 and
 encircled
 those
 little
 ones
 about
 and
 they
 were
 encircled
 about
 with
 fire
 and
 the
 angels
 did
 minister
 unto
 them
 The
 Lord
 Jesus
 sent
 for
 bread
 and
 wine
 and
 caused
 the
 people
 to
 sit
 down
 The
 bread
 He
 brake
 and
 blessed
 and
 gave
 thereof
 to
 the
 Twelve
 these
 having
 eaten
 distributed
 bread
 to
 the
 multitude
 The
 wine
 was
 blessed
 and
 all
 partook
 the
 Twelve
 first
 and
 afterward
 the
 people
 With
 impressiveness
 similar
 to
 that
 attending
 the
 institution
 of
 the
 Sacrament
 of
 the
 Lords
 Supper
 among
 the
 apostles
 in
 Jerusalem
 Jesus
 made
 plain
 the
 sanctity
 and
 significance
 of
 the
 ordinance
 saying
 that
 authority
 for
 its
 future
 administration
 would
 be
 given
 and
 that
 it
 was
 to
 be
 participated
 in
 by
 all
 who
 had
 been
 baptized
 into
 fellowship
 with
 Christ
 and
 was
 always
 to
 be
 observed
 in
 remembrance
 of
 Him
 the
 bread
 being
 the
 sacred
 emblem
 of
 His
 body
 the
 wine
 the
 token
 of
 His
 blood
 that
 had
 been
 shed
 By
 express
 commandment
 the
 Lord
 forbade
 the
 sacrament
 of
 bread
 and
 wine
 to
 all
 but
 the
 worthy
 For
 He
 explained
 whoso
 eateth
 and
 drinketh
 my
 flesh
 and
 blood
 unworthily
 eateth
 and
 drinketh
 damnation
 to
 his
 soul
 therefore
 if
 ye
 know
 that
 a
 man
 is
 unworthy
 to
 eat
 and
 drink
 of
 my
 flesh
 and
 blood
 ye
 shall
 forbid
 him
 But
 the
 people
 were
 forbidden
 to
 cast
 out
 from
 their
 assemblies
 those
 from
 whom
 the
 Sacrament
 was
 to
 be
 withheld
 if
 so
 be
 they
 would
 but
 repent
 and
 seek
 fellowship
 through
 baptism
 The
 necessity
 of
 prayer
 was
 explicitly
 emphasized
 by
 the
 Lord
 the
 commandment
 to
 pray
 being
 given
 to
 the
 Twelve
 and
 to
 the
 multitude
 separately
 Individual
 supplication
 family
 devotions
 and
 congregational
 worship
 were
 thus
 enjoined
 Therefore
 ye
 must
 always
 pray
 unto
 the
 Father
 in
 my
 name
 and
 whatsoever
 ye
 shall
 ask
 the
 Father
 in
 my
 name
 which
 is
 right
 believing
 that
 ye
 shall
 receive
 behold
 it
 shall
 be
 given
 unto
 you
 Pray
 in
 your
 families
 unto
 the
 Father
 always
 in
 my
 name
 that
 your
 wives
 and
 your
 children
 may
 be
 blessed
 And
 behold
 ye
 shall
 meet
 together
 oft
 and
 ye
 shall
 not
 forbid
 any
 man
 from
 coming
 unto
 you
 when
 ye
 shall
 meet
 together
 but
 suffer
 them
 that
 they
 may
 come
 unto
 you
 and
 forbid
 them
 not
 but
 ye
 shall
 pray
 for
 them
 and
 shall
 not
 cast
 them
 out
 and
 if
 it
 so
 be
 that
 they
 come
 unto
 you
 oft
 ye
 shall
 pray
 for
 them
 unto
 the
 Father
 in
 my
 name
 The
 Lord
 then
 touched
 with
 His
 hand
 each
 of
 the
 Twelve
 investing
 them
 in
 words
 unheard
 by
 others
 with
 power
 to
 confer
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 by
 the
 imposition
 of
 hands
 upon
 all
 repentant
 and
 baptized
 believers
 As
 he
 finished
 the
 ordination
 of
 the
 Twelve
 a
 cloud
 overshadowed
 the
 people
 so
 that
 the
 Lord
 was
 hidden
 from
 their
 sight
 but
 the
 twelve
 disciples
 saw
 and
 did
 bear
 record
 that
 he
 ascended
 again
 into
 heaven
 CHRISTS
 SECOND
 VISITATION
 TO
 THE
 NEPHITES
 On
 the
 morrow
 a
 yet
 greater
 multitude
 assembled
 in
 expectation
 of
 the
 Saviors
 return
 Throughout
 the
 night
 messengers
 had
 spread
 the
 glorious
 tidings
 of
 the
 Lords
 appearing
 and
 of
 His
 promise
 to
 again
 visit
 His
 people
 So
 great
 was
 the
 assembly
 that
 Nephi
 and
 his
 associates
 caused
 the
 people
 to
 separate
 into
 twelve
 bodies
 to
 each
 of
 which
 one
 of
 the
 disciples
 was
 assigned
 to
 impart
 instruction
 and
 to
 lead
 in
 prayer
 The
 burden
 of
 supplication
 was
 that
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 should
 be
 given
 unto
 them
 Led
 by
 the
 chosen
 disciples
 the
 whole
 vast
 concourse
 approached
 the
 waters
 edge
 and
 Nephi
 going
 first
 was
 baptized
 by
 immersion
 he
 then
 baptized
 the
 eleven
 others
 whom
 Jesus
 had
 chosen
 When
 the
 Twelve
 had
 come
 forth
 out
 of
 the
 water
 they
 were
 filled
 with
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 and
 with
 fire
 And
 behold
 they
 were
 encircled
 about
 as
 if
 it
 were
 fire
 and
 it
 came
 down
 from
 heaven
 and
 the
 multitude
 did
 witness
 it
 and
 do
 bear
 record
 and
 angels
 did
 come
 down
 out
 of
 heaven
 and
 did
 minister
 unto
 them
 And
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 that
 while
 the
 angels
 were
 ministering
 unto
 the
 disciples
 behold
 Jesus
 came
 and
 stood
 in
 the
 midst
 and
 ministered
 unto
 them
 Thus
 Jesus
 appeared
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 disciples
 and
 ministering
 angels
 At
 His
 command
 the
 Twelve
 and
 the
 multitude
 knelt
 in
 prayer
 and
 they
 prayed
 unto
 Jesus
 calling
 Him
 their
 Lord
 and
 their
 God
 Jesus
 separated
 Himself
 by
 a
 little
 space
 and
 in
 humble
 attitude
 prayed
 saying
 in
 part
 Father
 I
 thank
 thee
 that
 thou
 hast
 given
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 unto
 these
 whom
 I
 have
 chosen
 and
 it
 is
 because
 of
 their
 belief
 in
 me
 that
 I
 have
 chosen
 them
 out
 of
 the
 world
 Father
 I
 pray
 thee
 that
 thou
 wilt
 give
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 unto
 all
 them
 that
 shall
 believe
 in
 their
 words
 The
 disciples
 were
 yet
 fervently
 praying
 to
 Jesus
 when
 He
 returned
 to
 them
 and
 as
 He
 looked
 upon
 them
 with
 merciful
 and
 approving
 smile
 they
 were
 glorified
 in
 His
 presence
 so
 that
 their
 countenances
 and
 their
 apparel
 shone
 with
 a
 brilliancy
 like
 unto
 that
 of
 the
 face
 and
 garments
 of
 the
 Lord
 even
 so
 that
 there
 could
 be
 nothing
 on
 earth
 so
 white
 as
 the
 whiteness
 thereof
 A
 second
 and
 a
 third
 time
 Jesus
 retired
 and
 prayed
 unto
 the
 Father
 and
 while
 the
 people
 comprehended
 the
 meaning
 of
 His
 prayer
 they
 confessed
 and
 bare
 record
 that
 so
 great
 and
 marvellous
 were
 the
 words
 which
 he
 prayed
 that
 they
 cannot
 be
 written
 neither
 can
 they
 be
 uttered
 by
 man
 The
 Lord
 rejoiced
 in
 the
 faith
 of
 the
 people
 and
 to
 the
 disciples
 He
 said
 So
 great
 faith
 have
 I
 never
 seen
 among
 all
 the
 Jews
 wherefore
 I
 could
 not
 shew
 unto
 them
 so
 great
 miracles
 because
 of
 their
 unbelief
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 there
 are
 none
 of
 them
 that
 have
 seen
 so
 great
 things
 as
 ye
 have
 seen
 neither
 have
 they
 heard
 so
 great
 things
 as
 ye
 have
 heard
 Then
 the
 Lord
 administered
 the
 Sacrament
 in
 manner
 as
 on
 the
 yesterday
 but
 both
 the
 bread
 and
 the
 wine
 were
 provided
 without
 human
 aid
 The
 sanctity
 of
 the
 ordinance
 was
 thus
 expressed
 He
 that
 eateth
 this
 bread
 eateth
 of
 my
 body
 to
 his
 soul
 and
 he
 that
 drinketh
 of
 this
 wine
 drinketh
 of
 my
 blood
 to
 his
 soul
 and
 his
 soul
 shall
 never
 hunger
 nor
 thirst
 but
 shall
 be
 filled
 This
 was
 followed
 by
 instructions
 concerning
 the
 covenant
 people
 Israel
 of
 whom
 the
 Nephites
 were
 a
 part
 and
 of
 the
 relation
 they
 would
 bear
 to
 the
 Gentile
 nations
 in
 the
 future
 development
 of
 the
 divine
 purpose
 Jesus
 declared
 Himself
 to
 be
 that
 Prophet
 whose
 coming
 Moses
 had
 foretold
 and
 the
 Christ
 of
 whom
 all
 the
 prophets
 had
 testified
 The
 temporary
 supremacy
 of
 the
 Gentiles
 whereby
 the
 further
 scattering
 of
 Israel
 would
 be
 accomplished
 and
 the
 eventual
 gathering
 of
 the
 covenant
 people
 were
 predicted
 with
 frequent
 reference
 to
 the
 inspired
 utterances
 of
 Isaiah
 bearing
 thereon
 The
 future
 of
 Lehis
 descendants
 was
 pictured
 as
 a
 dwindling
 in
 unbelief
 through
 iniquity
 in
 consequence
 of
 which
 the
 Gentiles
 would
 grow
 to
 be
 a
 mighty
 people
 on
 the
 western
 continent
 even
 though
 that
 land
 had
 been
 given
 as
 an
 ultimate
 inheritance
 to
 the
 house
 of
 Israel
 The
 establishment
 of
 the
 then
 future
 but
 now
 existent
 American
 nation
 characterized
 as
 a
 free
 people
 was
 thus
 foretold
 and
 Gods
 purpose
 therein
 explained
 For
 it
 is
 wisdom
 in
 the
 Father
 that
 they
 should
 be
 established
 in
 this
 land
 and
 be
 set
 up
 as
 a
 free
 people
 by
 the
 power
 of
 the
 Father
 that
 these
 things
 might
 come
 forth
 from
 them
 unto
 a
 remnant
 of
 your
 seed
 that
 the
 covenant
 of
 the
 Father
 may
 be
 fulfilled
 which
 he
 hath
 covenanted
 with
 his
 people
 O
 house
 of
 Israel
 As
 a
 sign
 of
 the
 time
 in
 which
 the
 gathering
 of
 the
 several
 branches
 of
 Israel
 from
 their
 long
 dispersion
 should
 take
 place
 the
 Lord
 specified
 the
 prosperity
 of
 the
 Gentiles
 in
 America
 and
 their
 agency
 in
 bringing
 the
 scriptures
 to
 the
 degraded
 remnant
 of
 Lehis
 posterity
 or
 the
 American
 Indians
 It
 was
 made
 plain
 that
 all
 Gentiles
 who
 would
 repent
 and
 accept
 the
 gospel
 of
 Christ
 through
 baptism
 should
 be
 numbered
 among
 the
 covenant
 people
 and
 be
 made
 partakers
 of
 the
 blessings
 incident
 to
 the
 last
 days
 in
 which
 the
 New
 Jerusalem
 would
 be
 established
 on
 the
 American
 continent
 The
 joyful
 account
 of
 gathered
 Israel
 as
 Jehovah
 had
 given
 it
 aforetime
 through
 the
 mouth
 of
 His
 prophet
 Isaiah
 was
 repeated
 by
 the
 resurrected
 Jehovah
 to
 His
 Nephite
 flock
 Admonishing
 them
 to
 ponder
 the
 words
 of
 the
 prophets
 which
 were
 of
 record
 amongst
 them
 and
 to
 give
 heed
 to
 the
 new
 scriptures
 He
 had
 made
 known
 and
 especially
 commanding
 the
 Twelve
 to
 teach
 the
 people
 further
 concerning
 the
 things
 He
 had
 expounded
 the
 Lord
 informed
 them
 of
 the
 revelations
 given
 through
 Malachi
 and
 directed
 that
 the
 same
 be
 written
 The
 prophecies
 so
 reiterated
 by
 Him
 who
 had
 inspired
 Malachi
 to
 utterance
 were
 at
 that
 time
 obviously
 of
 the
 future
 and
 are
 even
 yet
 unfulfilled
 in
 their
 entirety
 The
 advent
 of
 the
 Lord
 to
 which
 these
 scriptures
 testify
 is
 yet
 future
 but
 that
 the
 time
 is
 now
 nearthat
 great
 and
 dreadful
 day
 of
 the
 Lordis
 attested
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 Elijah
 who
 was
 to
 come
 before
 that
 day
 has
 appeared
 in
 the
 discharge
 of
 his
 particular
 commissionthat
 of
 turning
 the
 hearts
 of
 the
 living
 children
 to
 their
 dead
 progenitors
 and
 the
 hearts
 of
 the
 departed
 fathers
 to
 their
 still
 mortal
 posterity
 The
 personal
 ministry
 of
 Christ
 on
 the
 occasion
 of
 this
 second
 visitation
 lasted
 three
 days
 during
 which
 He
 gave
 the
 people
 many
 scriptures
 such
 as
 had
 been
 before
 given
 unto
 the
 Jews
 for
 so
 the
 Father
 had
 commanded
 and
 He
 expounded
 unto
 them
 the
 purposes
 of
 God
 from
 the
 beginning
 until
 the
 time
 at
 which
 Christ
 shall
 return
 in
 His
 glory
 And
 even
 unto
 the
 great
 and
 last
 day
 when
 all
 people
 and
 all
 kindreds
 and
 all
 nations
 and
 tongues
 shall
 stand
 before
 God
 to
 be
 judged
 of
 their
 works
 whether
 they
 be
 good
 or
 whether
 they
 be
 evil
 if
 they
 be
 good
 to
 the
 resurrection
 of
 everlasting
 life
 and
 if
 they
 be
 evil
 to
 the
 resurrection
 of
 damnation
 being
 on
 a
 parallel
 the
 one
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 and
 the
 other
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 according
 to
 the
 mercy
 and
 the
 justice
 and
 the
 holiness
 which
 is
 in
 Christ
 who
 was
 before
 the
 world
 began
 In
 merciful
 ministration
 He
 healed
 their
 afflicted
 folk
 and
 raised
 a
 man
 from
 the
 dead
 At
 later
 but
 unspecified
 times
 He
 showed
 Himself
 among
 the
 Nephites
 and
 did
 break
 bread
 oft
 and
 bless
 it
 and
 give
 it
 unto
 them
 After
 His
 second
 ascension
 from
 among
 them
 the
 spirit
 of
 prophecy
 was
 manifest
 among
 the
 people
 and
 this
 extended
 even
 to
 children
 and
 babes
 many
 of
 whom
 spake
 of
 marvelous
 things
 as
 the
 Spirit
 gave
 them
 utterance
 The
 Twelve
 entered
 upon
 their
 ministry
 with
 vigor
 teaching
 all
 who
 would
 hear
 and
 baptizing
 those
 who
 through
 repentance
 sought
 communion
 with
 the
 Church
 Upon
 all
 who
 thus
 complied
 with
 the
 requirements
 of
 the
 gospel
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 was
 bestowed
 and
 those
 so
 blessed
 lived
 together
 in
 love
 and
 were
 called
 the
 Church
 of
 Christ
 CHRISTS
 VISITATION
 TO
 HIS
 CHOSEN
 TWELVE
 AMONG
 THE
 NEPHITES
 Under
 the
 administration
 of
 the
 twelve
 ordained
 disciples
 the
 Church
 grew
 and
 prospered
 in
 the
 land
 of
 Nephi
 The
 disciples
 as
 special
 witnesses
 of
 the
 Christ
 traveled
 preached
 taught
 and
 baptized
 all
 who
 professed
 faith
 and
 showed
 forth
 repentance
 On
 a
 certain
 occasion
 the
 Twelve
 were
 assembled
 in
 mighty
 prayer
 and
 fasting
 seeking
 instruction
 on
 a
 particular
 matter
 which
 notwithstanding
 the
 Lords
 injunction
 against
 contention
 had
 given
 rise
 to
 disputation
 among
 the
 people
 As
 they
 supplicated
 the
 Father
 in
 the
 Sons
 name
 Jesus
 appeared
 amongst
 them
 and
 asked
 What
 will
 ye
 that
 I
 shall
 give
 unto
 you
 Their
 answer
 was
 Lord
 we
 will
 that
 thou
 wouldst
 tell
 us
 the
 name
 whereby
 we
 shall
 call
 this
 church
 for
 there
 are
 disputations
 among
 the
 people
 concerning
 this
 matter
 They
 had
 provisionally
 called
 the
 community
 of
 baptized
 believers
 the
 Church
 of
 Christ
 but
 apparently
 this
 true
 and
 distinguishing
 name
 had
 not
 been
 generally
 accepted
 without
 question
 And
 the
 Lord
 said
 unto
 them
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 why
 is
 it
 that
 the
 people
 should
 murmur
 and
 dispute
 because
 of
 this
 thing
 Have
 they
 not
 read
 the
 scriptures
 which
 say
 ye
 must
 take
 upon
 you
 the
 name
 of
 Christ
 which
 is
 my
 name
 for
 by
 this
 name
 shall
 ye
 be
 called
 at
 the
 last
 day
 and
 whoso
 taketh
 upon
 him
 my
 name
 and
 endureth
 to
 the
 end
 the
 same
 shall
 be
 saved
 at
 the
 last
 day
 therefore
 whatsoever
 ye
 shall
 do
 ye
 shall
 do
 it
 in
 my
 name
 therefore
 ye
 shall
 call
 the
 church
 in
 my
 name
 and
 ye
 shall
 call
 upon
 the
 Father
 in
 my
 name
 that
 he
 will
 bless
 the
 church
 for
 my
 sake
 And
 how
 be
 it
 my
 church
 save
 it
 be
 called
 in
 my
 name
 for
 if
 a
 church
 be
 called
 in
 Moses
 name
 then
 it
 be
 Moses
 church
 or
 if
 it
 be
 called
 in
 the
 name
 of
 a
 man
 then
 it
 be
 the
 church
 of
 a
 man
 but
 if
 it
 be
 called
 in
 my
 name
 then
 it
 is
 my
 church
 if
 it
 so
 be
 that
 they
 are
 built
 upon
 my
 gospel
 Verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 that
 ye
 are
 built
 upon
 my
 gospel
 therefore
 ye
 shall
 call
 whatsoever
 things
 ye
 do
 call
 in
 my
 name
 therefore
 if
 ye
 call
 upon
 the
 Father
 for
 the
 church
 if
 it
 be
 in
 my
 name
 the
 Father
 will
 hear
 you
 and
 if
 it
 so
 be
 that
 the
 church
 is
 built
 upon
 my
 gospel
 then
 will
 the
 Father
 shew
 forth
 his
 own
 works
 in
 it
 but
 if
 it
 be
 not
 built
 upon
 my
 gospel
 and
 is
 built
 upon
 the
 works
 of
 men
 or
 upon
 the
 works
 of
 the
 devil
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 they
 have
 joy
 in
 their
 works
 for
 a
 season
 and
 by
 and
 by
 the
 end
 cometh
 and
 they
 are
 hewn
 down
 and
 cast
 into
 the
 fire
 from
 whence
 there
 is
 no
 return
 for
 their
 works
 do
 follow
 them
 for
 it
 is
 because
 of
 their
 works
 that
 they
 are
 hewn
 down
 therefore
 remember
 the
 things
 that
 I
 have
 told
 you
 In
 such
 wise
 did
 the
 Lord
 confirm
 as
 an
 authoritative
 bestowal
 the
 name
 which
 through
 inspiration
 had
 been
 assumed
 by
 His
 obedient
 children
 The
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 The
 Lords
 explanation
 as
 to
 the
 one
 and
 only
 Name
 by
 which
 the
 Church
 could
 be
 appropriately
 known
 is
 cogent
 and
 convincing
 It
 was
 not
 the
 church
 of
 Lehi
 or
 Nephi
 of
 Mosiah
 or
 Alma
 of
 Samuel
 or
 Helaman
 else
 it
 should
 have
 been
 called
 by
 the
 name
 of
 the
 man
 whose
 church
 it
 was
 even
 as
 today
 there
 are
 churches
 named
 after
 men
 but
 being
 the
 Church
 established
 by
 Jesus
 Christ
 it
 could
 properly
 bear
 none
 other
 name
 than
 His
 Jesus
 then
 reiterated
 to
 the
 Nephite
 Twelve
 many
 of
 the
 cardinal
 principles
 He
 had
 before
 enunciated
 to
 them
 and
 to
 the
 people
 at
 large
 and
 commanded
 that
 His
 words
 be
 written
 excepting
 certain
 exalted
 communications
 which
 He
 forbade
 them
 to
 write
 The
 importance
 of
 preserving
 as
 a
 priceless
 treasure
 the
 new
 scriptures
 He
 had
 given
 was
 shown
 with
 assurance
 that
 in
 heaven
 records
 were
 kept
 of
 all
 things
 done
 by
 divine
 direction
 The
 Twelve
 were
 told
 that
 they
 were
 to
 be
 the
 judges
 of
 their
 people
 and
 in
 view
 of
 such
 investiture
 they
 were
 admonished
 to
 diligence
 and
 godliness
 The
 Lord
 was
 made
 glad
 by
 the
 faith
 and
 ready
 obedience
 of
 the
 Nephites
 amongst
 whom
 He
 had
 ministered
 and
 to
 the
 twelve
 special
 witnesses
 He
 said
 And
 now
 behold
 my
 joy
 is
 great
 even
 unto
 fulness
 because
 of
 you
 and
 also
 this
 generation
 yea
 and
 even
 the
 Father
 rejoiceth
 and
 also
 all
 the
 holy
 angels
 because
 of
 you
 and
 this
 generation
 for
 none
 of
 them
 are
 lost
 Behold
 I
 would
 that
 ye
 should
 understand
 for
 I
 mean
 them
 who
 are
 now
 alive
 of
 this
 generation
 and
 none
 of
 them
 are
 lost
 and
 in
 them
 I
 have
 fulness
 of
 joy
 His
 joy
 however
 was
 mingled
 with
 sorrow
 because
 of
 the
 apostasy
 into
 which
 the
 later
 generations
 would
 fall
 this
 He
 foresaw
 as
 a
 dire
 condition
 that
 would
 attain
 its
 climax
 in
 the
 fourth
 generation
 from
 that
 time
 THE
 THREE
 NEPHITES
 In
 loving
 compassion
 the
 Lord
 spoke
 unto
 the
 twelve
 disciples
 one
 by
 one
 asking
 What
 is
 it
 that
 ye
 desire
 of
 me
 after
 that
 I
 am
 gone
 to
 the
 Father
 All
 but
 three
 expressed
 the
 desire
 that
 they
 might
 continue
 in
 the
 ministry
 until
 they
 had
 reached
 a
 goodly
 age
 and
 then
 in
 due
 time
 be
 received
 by
 the
 Lord
 into
 His
 kingdom
 To
 them
 Jesus
 gave
 blessed
 assurance
 saying
 After
 that
 ye
 are
 seventy
 and
 two
 years
 old
 ye
 shall
 come
 unto
 me
 in
 my
 kingdom
 and
 with
 me
 ye
 shall
 find
 rest
 He
 turned
 to
 the
 three
 who
 had
 reserved
 the
 request
 they
 ventured
 not
 to
 express
 And
 he
 said
 unto
 them
 Behold
 I
 know
 your
 thoughts
 and
 ye
 have
 desired
 the
 thing
 which
 John
 my
 beloved
 who
 was
 with
 me
 in
 my
 ministry
 before
 that
 I
 was
 lifted
 up
 by
 the
 Jews
 desired
 of
 me
 therefore
 more
 blessed
 are
 ye
 for
 ye
 shall
 never
 taste
 of
 death
 but
 ye
 shall
 live
 to
 behold
 all
 the
 doings
 of
 the
 Father
 unto
 the
 children
 of
 men
 even
 until
 all
 things
 shall
 be
 fulfilled
 according
 to
 the
 will
 of
 the
 Father
 when
 I
 shall
 come
 in
 my
 glory
 with
 the
 powers
 of
 heaven
 and
 ye
 shall
 never
 endure
 the
 pains
 of
 death
 but
 when
 I
 shall
 come
 in
 my
 glory
 ye
 shall
 be
 changed
 in
 the
 twinkling
 of
 an
 eye
 from
 mortality
 to
 immortality
 and
 then
 shall
 ye
 be
 blessed
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 my
 Father
 The
 blessed
 three
 were
 assured
 that
 in
 the
 course
 of
 their
 prolonged
 life
 they
 should
 be
 immune
 to
 pain
 and
 should
 know
 sorrow
 only
 as
 they
 grieved
 for
 the
 sins
 of
 the
 world
 For
 their
 desire
 to
 labor
 in
 bringing
 souls
 unto
 Christ
 as
 long
 as
 the
 world
 should
 stand
 they
 were
 promised
 an
 eventual
 fulness
 of
 joy
 even
 like
 unto
 that
 to
 which
 the
 Lord
 Himself
 had
 attained
 Jesus
 touched
 each
 of
 the
 nine
 who
 were
 to
 live
 and
 die
 in
 the
 Lord
 but
 the
 three
 who
 were
 to
 tarry
 till
 He
 would
 come
 in
 His
 glory
 He
 did
 not
 touch
 And
 then
 he
 departed
 A
 change
 was
 wrought
 in
 the
 bodies
 of
 the
 Three
 Nephites
 so
 that
 while
 they
 remained
 in
 the
 flesh
 they
 were
 exempt
 from
 the
 usual
 effects
 of
 physical
 vicissitude
 The
 heavens
 were
 opened
 to
 their
 gaze
 they
 were
 caught
 up
 and
 saw
 and
 heard
 unspeakable
 things
 And
 it
 was
 forbidden
 them
 that
 they
 should
 utter
 neither
 was
 it
 given
 unto
 them
 power
 that
 they
 could
 utter
 the
 things
 which
 they
 saw
 and
 heard
 Though
 they
 lived
 and
 labored
 as
 men
 among
 their
 fellows
 preaching
 baptizing
 and
 conferring
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 upon
 all
 who
 gave
 heed
 to
 their
 words
 the
 enemies
 to
 the
 truth
 were
 powerless
 to
 do
 them
 injury
 Somewhat
 later
 than
 a
 hundred
 and
 seventy
 years
 after
 the
 Lords
 last
 visitation
 malignant
 persecution
 was
 waged
 against
 the
 Three
 For
 their
 zeal
 in
 the
 ministry
 they
 were
 cast
 into
 prison
 but
 the
 prisons
 could
 not
 hold
 them
 for
 they
 were
 rent
 in
 twain
 They
 were
 incarcerated
 in
 underground
 dungeons
 But
 they
 did
 smite
 the
 earth
 with
 the
 word
 of
 God
 insomuch
 that
 by
 his
 power
 they
 were
 delivered
 out
 of
 the
 depths
 of
 the
 earth
 and
 therefore
 they
 could
 not
 dig
 pits
 sufficient
 to
 hold
 them
 Thrice
 they
 were
 cast
 into
 a
 furnace
 of
 fire
 but
 received
 no
 harm
 and
 three
 times
 were
 they
 thrown
 into
 dens
 of
 ravenous
 beasts
 but
 behold
 they
 did
 play
 with
 the
 beasts
 as
 a
 child
 with
 a
 suckling
 lamb
 and
 received
 no
 harm
 Mormon
 avers
 that
 in
 answer
 to
 his
 prayers
 the
 Lord
 had
 made
 known
 unto
 him
 that
 the
 change
 wrought
 upon
 the
 bodies
 of
 the
 Three
 was
 such
 as
 to
 deprive
 Satan
 of
 all
 power
 over
 them
 and
 that
 they
 were
 holy
 and
 that
 the
 powers
 of
 the
 earth
 could
 not
 hold
 them
 and
 in
 this
 state
 they
 were
 to
 remain
 until
 the
 judgment
 day
 of
 Christ
 and
 at
 that
 day
 they
 were
 to
 receive
 a
 greater
 change
 and
 to
 be
 received
 into
 the
 kingdom
 of
 the
 Father
 to
 go
 no
 more
 out
 but
 to
 dwell
 with
 God
 eternally
 in
 the
 heavens
 For
 nearly
 three
 hundred
 years
 and
 possibly
 longer
 the
 Three
 Nephites
 ministered
 visibly
 among
 their
 fellows
 but
 as
 the
 wickedness
 of
 the
 people
 increased
 these
 special
 ministers
 were
 withdrawn
 and
 thereafter
 manifested
 themselves
 only
 to
 the
 righteous
 few
 Moroni
 the
 last
 prophet
 of
 the
 Nephites
 when
 engaged
 in
 completing
 the
 record
 of
 his
 father
 Mormon
 and
 adding
 thereto
 matters
 of
 his
 own
 knowledge
 wrote
 concerning
 these
 three
 disciples
 of
 the
 Lord
 that
 they
 did
 tarry
 in
 the
 land
 until
 the
 wickedness
 of
 the
 people
 was
 so
 great
 that
 the
 Lord
 would
 not
 suffer
 them
 to
 remain
 with
 the
 people
 and
 whether
 they
 be
 upon
 the
 face
 of
 the
 land
 no
 man
 knoweth
 But
 behold
 my
 father
 and
 I
 have
 seen
 them
 and
 they
 have
 ministered
 unto
 us
 Their
 ministry
 was
 to
 be
 extended
 to
 Jews
 and
 Gentiles
 amongst
 whom
 they
 labor
 unrecognized
 as
 of
 ancient
 birth
 and
 they
 are
 sent
 unto
 the
 scattered
 tribes
 of
 Israel
 and
 to
 all
 nations
 kindreds
 tongues
 and
 peoples
 from
 whom
 they
 have
 brought
 and
 are
 bringing
 many
 souls
 unto
 Christ
 that
 their
 desire
 may
 be
 fulfilled
 and
 also
 because
 of
 the
 convincing
 power
 of
 God
 which
 is
 in
 them
 GROWTH
 OF
 THE
 CHURCH
 FOLLOWED
 BY
 THE
 APOSTASY
 OF
 THE
 NEPHITE
 NATION
 The
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 developed
 rapidly
 in
 the
 land
 of
 Nephi
 and
 brought
 to
 its
 faithful
 adherents
 unprecedented
 blessings
 Even
 the
 hereditary
 animosity
 between
 Nephites
 and
 Lamanites
 was
 forgotten
 and
 all
 lived
 in
 peace
 and
 prosperity
 So
 great
 was
 the
 unity
 of
 the
 Church
 that
 its
 members
 owned
 all
 things
 in
 common
 and
 therefore
 they
 were
 not
 rich
 and
 poor
 bond
 and
 free
 but
 they
 were
 all
 made
 free
 and
 partakers
 of
 the
 heavenly
 gift
 Populous
 cities
 replaced
 the
 desolation
 of
 ruin
 that
 had
 befallen
 at
 the
 time
 of
 the
 Lords
 crucifixion
 The
 land
 was
 blessed
 and
 the
 people
 rejoiced
 in
 righteousness
 And
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 that
 there
 was
 no
 contention
 in
 the
 land
 because
 of
 the
 love
 of
 God
 which
 did
 dwell
 in
 the
 hearts
 of
 the
 people
 And
 there
 were
 no
 envyings
 nor
 strifes
 nor
 tumults
 nor
 whoredoms
 nor
 lyings
 nor
 murders
 nor
 any
 manner
 of
 lasciviousness
 and
 surely
 there
 could
 not
 be
 a
 happier
 people
 among
 all
 the
 people
 who
 had
 been
 created
 by
 the
 hand
 of
 God
 Nine
 of
 the
 twelve
 special
 witnesses
 chosen
 by
 the
 Lord
 passed
 at
 appointed
 times
 to
 their
 rest
 and
 others
 were
 ordained
 in
 their
 stead
 The
 state
 of
 blessed
 prosperity
 and
 of
 common
 ownership
 continued
 for
 a
 period
 of
 a
 hundred
 and
 sixtyseven
 years
 but
 soon
 thereafter
 came
 a
 most
 distressing
 change
 Pride
 displaced
 humility
 display
 of
 costly
 apparel
 superseded
 the
 simplicity
 of
 happier
 days
 rivalry
 led
 to
 contention
 and
 thence
 the
 people
 did
 have
 their
 goods
 and
 their
 substance
 no
 more
 common
 among
 them
 and
 they
 began
 to
 be
 divided
 into
 classes
 and
 they
 began
 to
 build
 up
 churches
 unto
 themselves
 to
 get
 gain
 and
 began
 to
 deny
 the
 true
 church
 of
 Christ
 Manmade
 churches
 multiplied
 and
 persecution
 true
 sister
 to
 intolerance
 became
 rampant
 The
 redskinned
 Lamanites
 reverted
 to
 their
 degraded
 ways
 and
 developed
 a
 murderous
 hostility
 against
 their
 white
 brothers
 and
 all
 manner
 of
 corrupt
 practises
 became
 common
 among
 both
 nations
 For
 many
 decades
 the
 Nephites
 retreated
 before
 their
 aggressive
 foes
 making
 their
 way
 northeastward
 through
 what
 is
 now
 the
 United
 States
 About
 
 AD
 the
 last
 great
 battle
 was
 fought
 near
 the
 hill
 Cumorah
 and
 the
 Nephite
 nation
 became
 extinct
 The
 degenerate
 remnant
 of
 Lehis
 posterity
 the
 Lamanites
 or
 American
 Indians
 have
 continued
 until
 this
 day
 Moroni
 the
 last
 of
 the
 Nephite
 prophets
 hid
 away
 the
 record
 of
 his
 people
 in
 the
 hill
 Cumorah
 whence
 it
 has
 been
 brought
 forth
 by
 divine
 direction
 in
 the
 current
 dispensation
 That
 record
 is
 now
 before
 the
 world
 translated
 through
 the
 gift
 and
 power
 of
 God
 and
 published
 to
 the
 edification
 of
 all
 nations

 CHAPTER
 
 
 The
 Land
 BountifulThis
 comprized
 the
 northerly
 part
 of
 South
 America
 extending
 to
 the
 Isthmus
 of
 Panama
 On
 the
 north
 it
 was
 bounded
 by
 the
 Land
 of
 Desolation
 which
 embraced
 Central
 America
 and
 in
 later
 Nephite
 history
 an
 indefinite
 extent
 north
 of
 the
 Isthmus
 The
 South
 American
 continent
 in
 general
 is
 called
 in
 the
 Book
 of
 Mormon
 the
 Land
 of
 Nephi
 
 The
 Jewish
 and
 Nephite
 Versions
 of
 the
 Sermon
 on
 the
 MountAs
 indicated
 in
 the
 text
 one
 of
 the
 most
 impressive
 contrasts
 between
 the
 Sermon
 on
 the
 Mount
 and
 the
 virtual
 repetition
 of
 the
 discourse
 by
 our
 Lord
 on
 the
 occasion
 of
 His
 visit
 to
 the
 Nephites
 is
 that
 of
 prediction
 concerning
 the
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 law
 of
 Moses
 in
 the
 first
 delivery
 and
 unqualified
 affirmation
 in
 the
 second
 that
 the
 law
 had
 been
 fulfilled
 Among
 the
 Beatitudes
 certain
 differences
 appear
 in
 each
 of
 which
 the
 Nephite
 sermon
 is
 more
 explicit
 Thus
 instead
 of
 Blessed
 are
 the
 poor
 in
 spirit
 Matt
 
 we
 read
 Blessed
 are
 the
 poor
 in
 spirit
 who
 come
 unto
 me
 
 Nephi
 
 Instead
 of
 Blessed
 are
 they
 which
 do
 hunger
 and
 thirst
 after
 righteousness
 for
 they
 shall
 be
 filled
 Matt
 we
 read
 And
 blessed
 are
 all
 they
 who
 do
 hunger
 and
 thirst
 after
 righteousness
 for
 they
 shall
 be
 filled
 with
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 Nephi
 Instead
 of
 for
 righteousness
 sake
 Matt
 we
 have
 for
 my
 names
 sake
 Nephi
 For
 the
 difficult
 passage
 Ye
 are
 the
 salt
 of
 the
 earth
 but
 if
 the
 salt
 have
 lost
 his
 savour
 wherewith
 shall
 it
 be
 salted
 Matt
 we
 have
 the
 clearer
 expression
 I
 give
 unto
 you
 to
 be
 the
 salt
 of
 the
 earth
 but
 if
 the
 salt
 shall
 lose
 its
 savor
 wherewith
 shall
 the
 earth
 be
 salted
 Nephi
 And
 as
 already
 noted
 in
 place
 of
 one
 jot
 or
 one
 tittle
 shall
 in
 no
 wise
 pass
 from
 the
 law
 till
 all
 be
 fulfilled
 Matt
 we
 have
 one
 jot
 nor
 one
 tittle
 hath
 not
 passed
 away
 from
 the
 law
 but
 in
 me
 it
 hath
 all
 been
 fulfilled
 Nephi
 Variations
 in
 succeeding
 verses
 are
 incident
 to
 this
 prospective
 fulfilment
 Matt
 and
 affirmed
 accomplishment
 Nephi
 Instead
 of
 the
 strong
 analogy
 concerning
 the
 plucking
 out
 of
 an
 offending
 eye
 or
 the
 severing
 of
 an
 evil
 hand
 Matt
 we
 find
 Behold
 I
 give
 unto
 you
 a
 commandment
 that
 ye
 suffer
 none
 of
 these
 things
 to
 enter
 into
 your
 heart
 for
 it
 is
 better
 that
 ye
 should
 deny
 yourselves
 of
 these
 things
 wherein
 ye
 will
 take
 up
 your
 cross
 than
 that
 ye
 should
 be
 cast
 into
 hell
 Nephi
 Following
 the
 illustrative
 instances
 of
 the
 gospel
 requirements
 superseding
 those
 of
 the
 law
 the
 Nephite
 record
 presents
 this
 splendid
 summation
 Therefore
 those
 things
 which
 were
 of
 old
 time
 which
 were
 under
 the
 law
 in
 me
 are
 all
 fulfilled
 Old
 things
 are
 done
 away
 and
 all
 things
 have
 become
 new
 therefore
 I
 would
 that
 ye
 should
 be
 perfect
 even
 as
 I
 or
 your
 Father
 who
 is
 in
 heaven
 is
 perfect
 In
 Matthews
 report
 of
 the
 sermon
 little
 distinction
 is
 made
 between
 the
 precepts
 addressed
 to
 the
 multitude
 in
 general
 and
 the
 instructions
 given
 particularly
 to
 the
 Twelve
 Thus
 Matt
 
 was
 spoken
 inferentially
 to
 the
 apostles
 for
 they
 and
 not
 the
 people
 were
 to
 lay
 aside
 all
 worldly
 pursuits
 in
 the
 sermon
 delivered
 to
 the
 Nephites
 the
 distinction
 is
 thus
 made
 clear
 And
 now
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 that
 when
 Jesus
 had
 spoken
 these
 words
 he
 looked
 upon
 the
 twelve
 whom
 he
 had
 chosen
 and
 said
 unto
 them
 Remember
 the
 words
 which
 I
 have
 spoken
 For
 behold
 ye
 are
 they
 whom
 I
 have
 chosen
 to
 minister
 unto
 this
 people
 Therefore
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 take
 no
 thought
 for
 your
 life
 what
 ye
 shall
 eat
 or
 what
 ye
 shall
 drink
 nor
 yet
 for
 your
 body
 what
 ye
 shall
 put
 on
 Is
 not
 the
 life
 more
 than
 meat
 and
 the
 body
 than
 raiment
 etc
 See
 
 Nephi
 
 Matt
 
 opens
 with
 Judge
 not
 that
 ye
 be
 not
 judged
 without
 intimation
 as
 to
 its
 general
 or
 special
 application
 
 Nephi
 
 begins
 And
 now
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 that
 when
 Jesus
 had
 spoken
 these
 words
 he
 turned
 again
 to
 the
 multitude
 and
 did
 open
 his
 mouth
 unto
 them
 again
 saying
 Verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 judge
 not
 that
 ye
 be
 not
 judged
 A
 careful
 versebyverse
 comparison
 between
 the
 Sermon
 on
 the
 Mount
 as
 recorded
 by
 Matthew
 and
 the
 risen
 Lords
 discourse
 to
 His
 people
 on
 the
 western
 continent
 is
 earnestly
 recommended
 to
 every
 student
 
 Baptisms
 Among
 the
 Nephites
 After
 the
 Lords
 VisitationWe
 read
 that
 before
 the
 second
 appearing
 of
 Christ
 to
 the
 Nephites
 the
 chosen
 Twelve
 were
 baptized
 
 Nephi
 
 These
 men
 had
 doubtless
 been
 baptized
 before
 for
 Nephi
 had
 been
 empowered
 not
 only
 to
 baptize
 but
 to
 ordain
 others
 to
 the
 requisite
 authority
 for
 administering
 baptism
 
 Nephi
 
 The
 baptism
 of
 the
 disciples
 on
 the
 morn
 of
 the
 Saviors
 second
 visit
 was
 in
 the
 nature
 of
 a
 rebaptism
 involving
 a
 renewal
 of
 covenants
 and
 confession
 of
 faith
 in
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 It
 is
 possible
 that
 in
 the
 earlier
 Nephite
 baptisms
 some
 irregularity
 in
 mode
 or
 impropriety
 in
 the
 spirit
 of
 administering
 the
 ordinance
 may
 have
 arisen
 for
 as
 we
 have
 seen
 the
 Lord
 enjoined
 upon
 the
 people
 in
 connection
 with
 the
 instructions
 concerning
 baptism
 that
 disputations
 must
 cease
 
 Nephi
 
 As
 to
 second
 or
 later
 baptisms
 the
 author
 has
 written
 elsewhere
 see
 The
 Articles
 of
 Faith
 vii
 practically
 as
 follows
 Rebaptisms
 recorded
 in
 scripture
 are
 few
 and
 in
 each
 instance
 the
 special
 circumstances
 justifying
 the
 action
 are
 apparent
 Thus
 we
 read
 of
 Paul
 baptizing
 certain
 disciples
 at
 Ephesus
 though
 they
 had
 already
 been
 immersed
 after
 the
 manner
 of
 Johns
 baptism
 But
 in
 this
 case
 the
 apostle
 was
 evidently
 unconvinced
 that
 the
 baptism
 had
 been
 solemnized
 by
 due
 authority
 or
 that
 the
 believers
 had
 been
 properly
 instructed
 as
 to
 the
 import
 of
 the
 ordinance
 When
 he
 tested
 the
 efficacy
 of
 their
 baptism
 by
 asking
 Have
 ye
 received
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 since
 ye
 believed
 they
 answered
 him
 We
 have
 not
 so
 much
 as
 heard
 whether
 there
 be
 any
 Holy
 Ghost
 Then
 asked
 he
 in
 seeming
 surprize
 Unto
 what
 then
 were
 ye
 baptized
 and
 they
 said
 Unto
 Johns
 baptism
 Then
 said
 Paul
 John
 verily
 baptized
 with
 the
 baptism
 of
 repentance
 saying
 unto
 the
 people
 that
 they
 should
 believe
 on
 him
 which
 should
 come
 after
 him
 that
 is
 on
 Christ
 Jesus
 When
 they
 heard
 this
 they
 were
 baptized
 in
 the
 name
 of
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 See
 Acts
 
 In
 the
 Church
 today
 a
 repetition
 of
 the
 baptismal
 rite
 on
 an
 individual
 is
 allowable
 under
 certain
 specific
 conditions
 Thus
 if
 one
 having
 entered
 the
 Church
 by
 baptism
 withdraws
 from
 it
 or
 is
 excommunicated
 therefrom
 and
 afterward
 repents
 and
 desires
 to
 regain
 his
 standing
 in
 the
 Church
 he
 can
 do
 so
 only
 through
 baptism
 However
 such
 is
 a
 repetition
 of
 the
 initiatory
 ordinance
 as
 previously
 administered
 There
 is
 no
 ordinance
 of
 rebaptism
 in
 the
 Church
 distinct
 in
 nature
 form
 or
 purpose
 from
 other
 baptism
 and
 therefore
 in
 administering
 baptism
 to
 a
 subject
 who
 has
 been
 formerly
 baptized
 the
 form
 of
 the
 ceremony
 is
 exactly
 the
 same
 as
 in
 first
 baptisms

 CHAPTER
 
 THE
 LONG
 NIGHT
 OF
 APOSTASY
 For
 over
 seventeen
 hundred
 years
 on
 the
 eastern
 hemisphere
 and
 for
 more
 than
 fourteen
 centuries
 on
 the
 western
 there
 appears
 to
 have
 been
 silence
 between
 the
 heavens
 and
 the
 earth
 Of
 direct
 revelation
 from
 God
 to
 man
 during
 this
 long
 interval
 we
 have
 no
 authentic
 record
 As
 already
 shown
 the
 period
 of
 apostolic
 ministry
 on
 the
 eastern
 continent
 probably
 terminated
 before
 the
 dawn
 of
 the
 second
 century
 of
 the
 Christian
 era
 The
 passing
 of
 the
 apostles
 was
 followed
 by
 the
 rapid
 development
 of
 a
 universal
 apostasy
 as
 had
 been
 foreseen
 and
 predicted
 In
 the
 accomplishment
 of
 this
 great
 falling
 away
 external
 and
 internal
 causes
 cooperated
 Among
 the
 disintegrating
 forces
 acting
 from
 without
 the
 most
 effective
 was
 the
 persistent
 persecution
 to
 which
 the
 saints
 were
 subjected
 incident
 to
 both
 Judaistic
 and
 pagan
 opposition
 Vast
 numbers
 who
 had
 professed
 membership
 and
 many
 who
 had
 been
 officers
 in
 the
 ministry
 deserted
 the
 Church
 while
 a
 few
 were
 stimulated
 to
 greater
 zeal
 under
 the
 scourge
 of
 persecution
 The
 general
 effect
 of
 opposition
 from
 the
 outsideof
 external
 causes
 of
 decline
 in
 faith
 and
 works
 considered
 as
 a
 wholewas
 the
 defection
 of
 individuals
 resulting
 in
 a
 widespread
 apostasy
 from
 the
 Church
 But
 immeasurably
 more
 serious
 was
 the
 result
 of
 internal
 dissension
 schism
 and
 disruption
 whereby
 an
 absolute
 apostasy
 of
 the
 Church
 from
 the
 way
 and
 word
 of
 God
 was
 brought
 about
 Judaism
 was
 the
 earliest
 oppressor
 of
 Christianity
 and
 became
 the
 instigator
 and
 abettor
 of
 the
 succeeding
 atrocities
 incident
 to
 pagan
 persecution
 Open
 and
 vigorous
 hostility
 of
 the
 Roman
 powers
 against
 the
 Christian
 Church
 became
 general
 during
 the
 reign
 of
 Nero
 beginning
 about
 
 AD
 and
 continued
 with
 occasional
 respites
 of
 a
 few
 months
 or
 even
 years
 at
 a
 time
 to
 the
 close
 of
 Diocletians
 reign
 about
 
 AD
 The
 inhuman
 cruelty
 and
 savage
 barbarity
 to
 which
 were
 subjected
 those
 who
 dared
 profess
 the
 name
 of
 Christ
 during
 these
 centuries
 of
 heathen
 domination
 are
 matters
 of
 accepted
 history
 When
 Constantine
 the
 Great
 came
 to
 the
 throne
 in
 the
 first
 quarter
 of
 the
 fourth
 century
 a
 radical
 change
 was
 inaugurated
 in
 the
 attitude
 of
 the
 state
 toward
 the
 church
 The
 emperor
 straightway
 made
 the
 socalled
 Christianity
 of
 the
 time
 the
 religion
 of
 his
 realm
 and
 zealous
 devotion
 to
 the
 church
 became
 the
 surest
 recommendation
 to
 imperial
 favor
 But
 the
 church
 was
 already
 in
 great
 measure
 an
 apostate
 institution
 and
 even
 in
 crude
 outline
 of
 organization
 and
 service
 bore
 but
 remote
 resemblance
 to
 the
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 founded
 by
 the
 Savior
 and
 builded
 through
 the
 instrumentality
 of
 the
 apostles
 Whatever
 vestiges
 of
 genuine
 Christianity
 may
 have
 possibly
 survived
 in
 the
 church
 before
 were
 buried
 beyond
 the
 sight
 of
 man
 by
 the
 abuses
 that
 followed
 the
 elevation
 of
 the
 churchly
 organization
 to
 secular
 favor
 through
 the
 decree
 of
 Constantine
 The
 emperor
 even
 though
 unbaptized
 made
 himself
 the
 head
 of
 the
 church
 and
 priestly
 office
 was
 more
 sought
 after
 than
 military
 rank
 or
 state
 preferment
 The
 spirit
 of
 apostasy
 by
 which
 the
 church
 had
 become
 permeated
 before
 Constantine
 threw
 about
 it
 the
 mantle
 of
 imperial
 protection
 and
 emblazoned
 it
 with
 the
 insignia
 of
 state
 now
 was
 roused
 to
 increased
 activity
 as
 the
 leaven
 of
 Satans
 own
 culture
 flourished
 under
 the
 conditions
 most
 favorable
 for
 such
 fungoid
 growth
 The
 bishop
 of
 Rome
 had
 already
 asserted
 supremacy
 over
 his
 fellows
 in
 the
 episcopate
 but
 when
 the
 emperor
 made
 Byzantium
 his
 capital
 and
 renamed
 it
 in
 his
 own
 honor
 Constantinople
 the
 bishop
 of
 that
 city
 claimed
 equality
 with
 the
 Roman
 pontiff
 The
 claim
 was
 contested
 the
 ensuing
 dissension
 divided
 the
 church
 and
 the
 disruption
 has
 persisted
 until
 the
 present
 day
 as
 is
 evidenced
 by
 the
 existing
 distinction
 between
 the
 Roman
 Catholic
 and
 the
 Greek
 Catholic
 churches
 The
 Roman
 pontiff
 exercized
 secular
 as
 well
 as
 spiritual
 authority
 and
 in
 the
 eleventh
 century
 arrogated
 to
 himself
 the
 title
 of
 Pope
 signifying
 Father
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 paternal
 ruler
 in
 all
 things
 During
 the
 twelfth
 and
 thirteenth
 centuries
 the
 temporal
 authority
 of
 the
 pope
 was
 superior
 to
 that
 of
 kings
 and
 emperors
 and
 the
 Roman
 church
 became
 the
 despotic
 potentate
 of
 nations
 and
 an
 autocrat
 above
 all
 secular
 states
 Yet
 this
 church
 reeking
 with
 the
 stench
 of
 worldly
 ambition
 and
 lust
 of
 dominance
 audaciously
 claimed
 to
 be
 the
 Church
 established
 by
 Him
 who
 affirmed
 My
 kingdom
 is
 not
 of
 this
 world
 The
 arrogant
 assumptions
 of
 the
 Church
 of
 Rome
 were
 not
 less
 extravagant
 in
 spiritual
 than
 in
 secular
 administration
 In
 her
 loudly
 asserted
 control
 over
 the
 spiritual
 destinies
 of
 the
 souls
 of
 men
 she
 blasphemously
 pretended
 to
 forgive
 or
 retain
 individual
 sins
 and
 to
 inflict
 or
 remit
 penalties
 both
 on
 earth
 and
 beyond
 the
 grave
 She
 sold
 permission
 to
 commit
 sin
 and
 bartered
 for
 gold
 charters
 of
 indulgent
 forgiveness
 for
 sins
 already
 done
 Her
 pope
 proclaiming
 himself
 the
 vicar
 of
 God
 sat
 in
 state
 to
 judge
 as
 God
 Himself
 and
 by
 such
 blasphemy
 fulfilled
 the
 prophecy
 of
 Paul
 following
 his
 warning
 in
 relation
 to
 the
 awful
 conditions
 antecedent
 to
 the
 second
 coming
 of
 the
 Christ
 Let
 no
 man
 deceive
 you
 by
 any
 means
 for
 that
 day
 shall
 not
 come
 except
 there
 come
 a
 falling
 away
 first
 and
 that
 man
 of
 sin
 be
 revealed
 the
 son
 of
 perdition
 Who
 opposeth
 and
 exalteth
 himself
 above
 all
 that
 is
 called
 God
 or
 that
 is
 worshipped
 so
 that
 he
 as
 God
 sitteth
 in
 the
 temple
 of
 God
 shewing
 himself
 that
 he
 is
 God
 In
 her
 unrestrained
 abandon
 to
 the
 license
 of
 arrogated
 authority
 the
 Church
 of
 Rome
 hesitated
 not
 to
 transgress
 the
 law
 of
 God
 change
 the
 ordinances
 essential
 to
 salvation
 and
 ruthlessly
 break
 the
 everlasting
 covenant
 thereby
 defiling
 the
 earth
 even
 as
 Isaiah
 had
 foretold
 She
 altered
 the
 ordinance
 of
 baptism
 destroying
 its
 symbolism
 and
 associating
 with
 it
 imitations
 of
 pagan
 rites
 she
 corrupted
 the
 Sacrament
 of
 the
 Lords
 Supper
 and
 befouled
 the
 doctrine
 thereof
 by
 the
 vagary
 of
 transubstantiation
 she
 assumed
 to
 apply
 the
 merits
 of
 the
 righteous
 to
 the
 forgiveness
 of
 the
 sinner
 in
 the
 unscriptural
 and
 wholly
 repellent
 dogma
 of
 supererogation
 she
 promoted
 idolatry
 in
 most
 seductive
 and
 pernicious
 forms
 she
 penalized
 the
 study
 of
 the
 holy
 scriptures
 by
 the
 people
 at
 large
 she
 enjoined
 an
 unnatural
 state
 of
 celibacy
 upon
 her
 clergy
 she
 revelled
 in
 unholy
 union
 with
 the
 theories
 and
 sophistries
 of
 men
 and
 so
 adulterated
 the
 simple
 doctrines
 of
 the
 gospel
 of
 Christ
 as
 to
 produce
 a
 creed
 rank
 with
 superstition
 and
 heresy
 she
 promulgated
 such
 perverted
 doctrines
 regarding
 the
 human
 body
 as
 to
 make
 the
 divinely
 formed
 tabernacle
 of
 flesh
 appear
 as
 a
 thing
 fit
 only
 to
 be
 tortured
 and
 contemned
 she
 proclaimed
 it
 an
 act
 of
 virtue
 insuring
 rich
 reward
 to
 lie
 and
 deceive
 if
 thereby
 her
 own
 interests
 might
 be
 subserved
 and
 she
 so
 thoroughly
 departed
 from
 the
 original
 plan
 of
 Church
 organization
 as
 to
 make
 of
 herself
 a
 spectacle
 of
 ornate
 display
 fabricated
 by
 the
 caprice
 of
 man
 The
 most
 important
 of
 the
 internal
 causes
 by
 which
 the
 apostasy
 of
 the
 Primitive
 Church
 was
 brought
 about
 may
 be
 thus
 summarized
 
 The
 corrupting
 of
 the
 simple
 doctrines
 of
 the
 gospel
 of
 Christ
 by
 admixture
 with
 socalled
 philosophic
 systems
 
 Unauthorized
 additions
 to
 the
 prescribed
 rites
 of
 the
 Church
 and
 the
 introduction
 of
 vital
 alterations
 in
 essential
 ordinances
 
 Unauthorized
 changes
 in
 Church
 organization
 and
 government
 Under
 the
 tyrannous
 repression
 incident
 to
 usurped
 and
 unrighteous
 domination
 by
 the
 Roman
 church
 civilization
 was
 retarded
 and
 for
 centuries
 was
 practically
 halted
 in
 its
 course
 The
 period
 of
 retrogression
 is
 known
 in
 history
 as
 the
 Dark
 Ages
 The
 fifteenth
 century
 witnessed
 the
 movement
 known
 as
 the
 Renaissance
 or
 Revival
 of
 Learning
 there
 was
 a
 general
 and
 significantly
 rapid
 awakening
 among
 men
 and
 a
 determined
 effort
 to
 shake
 off
 the
 stupor
 of
 indolence
 and
 ignorance
 was
 manifest
 throughout
 the
 civilized
 world
 By
 historians
 and
 philosophers
 the
 revival
 has
 been
 regarded
 as
 an
 unconscious
 and
 spontaneous
 prompting
 of
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 times
 it
 was
 a
 development
 predetermined
 in
 the
 Mind
 of
 God
 to
 illumine
 the
 benighted
 minds
 of
 men
 in
 preparation
 for
 the
 restoration
 of
 the
 gospel
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 which
 was
 appointed
 to
 be
 accomplished
 some
 centuries
 later
 With
 the
 renewal
 of
 intellectual
 activity
 and
 effort
 in
 material
 betterment
 there
 came
 as
 a
 natural
 and
 inevitable
 accompaniment
 protest
 and
 revolt
 against
 the
 ecclesiastical
 tyranny
 of
 the
 age
 The
 Albigenses
 in
 France
 had
 risen
 in
 insurrection
 against
 churchly
 despotism
 during
 the
 thirteenth
 century
 and
 in
 the
 fourteenth
 John
 Wickliffe
 of
 Oxford
 University
 had
 boldly
 denounced
 the
 corruption
 of
 the
 Roman
 church
 and
 clergy
 and
 particularly
 the
 restrictions
 imposed
 by
 the
 papal
 hierarchy
 on
 the
 popular
 study
 of
 the
 scriptures
 Wickliffe
 gave
 to
 the
 world
 a
 version
 of
 the
 Holy
 Bible
 in
 English
 These
 manifestations
 of
 independent
 belief
 and
 action
 the
 papal
 church
 sought
 to
 repress
 and
 punish
 by
 force
 The
 Albigenses
 had
 been
 subjected
 to
 inhuman
 cruelties
 and
 unrestrained
 slaughter
 Wickliffe
 was
 the
 subject
 of
 severe
 and
 persistent
 persecution
 and
 though
 he
 died
 in
 his
 bed
 the
 vindictiveness
 of
 the
 Roman
 church
 was
 unsated
 until
 she
 had
 caused
 his
 body
 to
 be
 exhumed
 and
 burned
 and
 the
 ashes
 scattered
 abroad
 John
 Huss
 and
 Jerome
 of
 Prague
 were
 prominent
 on
 the
 continent
 of
 Europe
 in
 agitation
 against
 papal
 despotism
 and
 both
 fell
 martyrs
 to
 the
 cause
 Though
 the
 church
 had
 become
 apostate
 to
 the
 core
 there
 were
 not
 lacking
 men
 brave
 of
 heart
 and
 righteous
 of
 soul
 ready
 to
 give
 their
 lives
 to
 the
 furtherance
 of
 spiritual
 emancipation
 A
 notable
 revolt
 against
 the
 papacy
 occurred
 in
 the
 sixteenth
 century
 and
 is
 known
 as
 the
 Reformation
 This
 movement
 was
 begun
 in
 
 by
 Martin
 Luther
 a
 German
 monk
 and
 it
 spread
 so
 rapidly
 as
 soon
 to
 involve
 the
 whole
 domain
 of
 popedom
 Formal
 protests
 against
 the
 despotism
 of
 the
 papal
 church
 were
 formulated
 by
 the
 representatives
 of
 certain
 German
 principalities
 and
 other
 delegates
 at
 a
 diet
 or
 general
 council
 held
 at
 Spires
 AD
 
 and
 the
 reformers
 were
 thenceforth
 known
 as
 Protestants
 An
 independent
 church
 was
 proposed
 by
 John
 Elector
 of
 Saxony
 a
 constitution
 for
 which
 was
 prepared
 at
 his
 instance
 by
 Luther
 and
 his
 colleague
 Melanchthon
 The
 Protestants
 were
 discordant
 Being
 devoid
 of
 divine
 authority
 to
 guide
 them
 in
 matters
 of
 church
 organization
 and
 doctrine
 they
 followed
 the
 diverse
 ways
 of
 men
 and
 were
 rent
 within
 while
 assailed
 from
 without
 The
 Roman
 church
 confronted
 by
 determined
 opponents
 hesitated
 at
 no
 extreme
 of
 cruelty
 The
 court
 of
 the
 Inquisition
 which
 had
 been
 established
 in
 the
 latter
 part
 of
 the
 fifteenth
 century
 under
 the
 infamously
 sacrilegious
 name
 of
 the
 Holy
 Office
 became
 intoxicated
 with
 the
 lust
 of
 barbarous
 cruelty
 in
 the
 century
 of
 the
 Reformation
 and
 inflicted
 indescribable
 tortures
 on
 persons
 secretly
 accused
 of
 heresy
 In
 the
 early
 stages
 of
 the
 Reformation
 instigated
 by
 Luther
 the
 king
 of
 England
 Henry
 VIII
 declared
 himself
 a
 supporter
 of
 the
 pope
 and
 was
 rewarded
 by
 a
 papal
 bestowal
 of
 the
 distinguishing
 title
 Defender
 of
 the
 Faith
 Within
 a
 few
 years
 this
 same
 British
 sovereign
 was
 excommunicated
 from
 the
 Roman
 church
 because
 of
 impatient
 disregard
 of
 the
 popes
 authority
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 Henrys
 desire
 to
 divorce
 Queen
 Catherine
 so
 that
 he
 could
 marry
 one
 of
 her
 maids
 The
 British
 parliament
 in
 
 passed
 the
 Act
 of
 Supremacy
 by
 which
 the
 nation
 was
 declared
 free
 from
 all
 allegiance
 to
 papal
 authority
 By
 Act
 of
 Parliament
 the
 king
 was
 made
 the
 head
 of
 the
 church
 within
 his
 own
 dominions
 Thus
 was
 born
 the
 Church
 of
 England
 a
 direct
 result
 of
 the
 licentious
 amours
 of
 a
 debauched
 and
 infamous
 king
 With
 blasphemous
 indifference
 to
 the
 absence
 of
 divine
 commission
 with
 no
 semblance
 of
 priestly
 succession
 an
 adulterous
 sovereign
 created
 a
 church
 provided
 therein
 a
 priesthood
 of
 his
 own
 and
 proclaimed
 himself
 supreme
 administrator
 in
 all
 matters
 spiritual
 With
 the
 conflict
 between
 Catholicism
 and
 Protestantism
 in
 Great
 Britain
 the
 student
 of
 history
 is
 familiar
 Suffice
 it
 here
 to
 say
 that
 the
 mutual
 hatred
 of
 the
 two
 contending
 sects
 the
 zeal
 of
 their
 respective
 adherents
 their
 professed
 love
 of
 God
 and
 devotion
 to
 Christs
 service
 were
 chiefly
 signalized
 by
 the
 sword
 the
 ax
 and
 the
 stake
 Revelling
 in
 the
 realization
 of
 at
 least
 a
 partial
 emancipation
 from
 the
 tyranny
 of
 priestcraft
 men
 and
 nations
 debauched
 their
 newly
 acquired
 liberty
 of
 thought
 speech
 and
 action
 in
 a
 riot
 of
 abhorrent
 excess
 The
 miscalled
 Age
 of
 Reason
 and
 the
 atheistical
 abominations
 culminating
 in
 the
 French
 Revolution
 stand
 as
 ineffaceable
 testimony
 of
 what
 man
 may
 become
 when
 glorying
 in
 his
 denial
 of
 God
 Is
 it
 to
 be
 wondered
 at
 that
 from
 the
 sixteenth
 century
 onward
 churches
 of
 mans
 contriving
 have
 multiplied
 with
 phenomenal
 rapidity
 Churches
 and
 churchly
 organizations
 professing
 Christianity
 as
 their
 creed
 have
 come
 to
 be
 numbered
 by
 hundreds
 On
 every
 side
 is
 heard
 in
 this
 day
 Lo
 here
 is
 Christ
 or
 Lo
 there
 There
 are
 sects
 named
 from
 the
 circumstances
 of
 their
 originas
 the
 Church
 of
 England
 others
 after
 their
 famous
 founders
 or
 promotersas
 Lutheran
 Calvinist
 Wesleyan
 some
 are
 known
 by
 peculiarities
 of
 doctrine
 or
 plan
 of
 administrationas
 Methodist
 Presbyterian
 Baptist
 Congregationalist
 but
 down
 to
 the
 third
 decade
 of
 the
 nineteenth
 century
 there
 was
 no
 church
 on
 earth
 affirming
 name
 or
 title
 as
 the
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 The
 only
 organization
 called
 a
 church
 existing
 at
 that
 time
 and
 venturing
 to
 assert
 claim
 to
 authority
 by
 succession
 was
 the
 Catholic
 church
 which
 for
 centuries
 had
 been
 apostate
 and
 wholly
 bereft
 of
 divine
 authority
 or
 recognition
 If
 the
 mother
 church
 be
 without
 a
 valid
 priesthood
 and
 devoid
 of
 spiritual
 power
 how
 can
 her
 offspring
 derive
 from
 her
 the
 right
 to
 officiate
 in
 the
 things
 of
 God
 Who
 would
 dare
 to
 affirm
 that
 man
 can
 originate
 a
 priesthood
 which
 God
 is
 bound
 to
 honor
 and
 acknowledge
 Granted
 that
 men
 may
 and
 do
 create
 among
 themselves
 societies
 associations
 sects
 and
 even
 churches
 if
 they
 choose
 so
 to
 designate
 their

 granted
 that
 they
 may
 prescribe

 formulate

 and
 devize
 plans
 of
 operation
 discipline
 and
 government
 and
 that
 all
 such
 laws
 rules
 and
 schemes
 of
 administration
 are
 binding
 upon
 those
 who
 assume
 membershipgranted
 all
 these
 rights
 and
 powerswhence
 can
 such
 human
 institutions
 derive
 the
 authority
 of
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 without
 which
 there
 can
 be
 no
 Church
 of
 Christ
 The
 apostate
 condition
 of
 Christendom
 has
 been
 frankly
 admitted
 by
 many
 eminent
 and
 conscientious
 representatives
 of
 the
 several
 churches
 and
 by
 churches
 as
 institutions
 Even
 the
 Church
 of
 England
 acknowledges
 the
 awful
 fact
 in
 her
 official
 declaration
 of
 degeneracy
 as
 set
 forth
 in
 the
 Homily
 Against
 Peril
 of
 Idolatry
 in
 these
 words
 So
 that
 laity
 and
 clergy
 learned
 and
 unlearned
 all
 ages
 sects
 and
 degrees
 of
 men
 women
 and
 children
 of
 whole
 Christendoman
 horrible
 and
 most
 dreadful
 thing
 to
 thinkhave
 been
 at
 once
 drowned
 in
 abominable
 idolatry
 of
 all
 other
 vices
 most
 detested
 of
 God
 and
 most
 damnable
 to
 man
 and
 that
 by
 the
 space
 of
 eight
 hundred
 years
 and
 more
 Let
 it
 not
 be
 concluded
 that
 through
 the
 night
 of
 the
 universal
 apostasy
 long
 and
 dark
 as
 it
 was
 God
 had
 forgotten
 the
 world
 Mankind
 had
 not
 been
 left
 wholly
 to
 itself
 The
 Spirit
 of
 God
 was
 operative
 so
 far
 as
 the
 unbelief
 of
 men
 permitted
 John
 the
 apostle
 and
 the
 Three
 Nephite
 disciples
 were
 ministering
 among
 men
 though
 unknown
 But
 through
 the
 centuries
 of
 spiritual
 darkness
 men
 lived
 and
 died
 without
 the
 administration
 of
 a
 contemporary
 apostle
 prophet
 elder
 bishop
 priest
 teacher
 or
 deacon
 Whatever
 of
 the
 form
 of
 Godliness
 existed
 in
 the
 churches
 of
 human
 establishment
 was
 destitute
 of
 divine
 power
 The
 time
 foreseen
 by
 the
 inspired
 apostle
 had
 fully
 comemankind
 in
 general
 refused
 to
 endure
 sound
 doctrine
 but
 having
 itching
 ears
 did
 they
 heap
 to
 themselves
 teachers
 after
 their
 own
 lusts
 and
 verily
 had
 they
 turned
 away
 their
 ears
 from
 the
 truth
 to
 follow
 after
 fables
 The
 first
 quarter
 of
 the
 nineteenth
 century
 witnessed
 the
 cumulative
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 conditions
 predicted
 through
 the
 prophet
 Amos
 Behold
 the
 days
 come
 saith
 the
 Lord
 God
 that
 I
 will
 send
 a
 famine
 in
 the
 land
 not
 a
 famine
 of
 bread
 nor
 a
 thirst
 for
 water
 but
 of
 hearing
 the
 words
 of
 the
 Lord
 And
 they
 shall
 wander
 from
 sea
 to
 sea
 and
 from
 the
 north
 even
 to
 the
 east
 they
 shall
 run
 to
 and
 fro
 to
 seek
 the
 word
 of
 the
 Lord
 and
 shall
 not
 find
 it
 Throughout
 the
 period
 of
 apostasy
 the
 windows
 of
 heaven
 had
 been
 shut
 toward
 the
 world
 so
 as
 to
 preclude
 all
 direct
 revelation
 from
 God
 and
 particularly
 any
 personal
 ministration
 or
 theophany
 of
 the
 Christ
 Mankind
 had
 ceased
 to
 know
 God
 and
 had
 invested
 the
 utterances
 of
 prophets
 and
 apostles
 of
 old
 who
 had
 known
 Him
 with
 a
 pall
 of
 mystery
 and
 fancy
 so
 that
 the
 True
 and
 the
 Living
 God
 was
 no
 longer
 believed
 to
 exist
 but
 in
 His
 place
 the
 sectaries
 had
 tried
 to
 conceive
 of
 an
 incomprehensible
 being
 devoid
 of
 body
 parts
 or
 passions
 an
 immaterial
 nothing
 But
 it
 had
 been
 determined
 in
 the
 councils
 of
 heaven
 that
 after
 many
 centuries
 of
 benighted
 ignorance
 the
 world
 should
 be
 illumined
 anew
 by
 the
 light
 of
 truth
 Through
 the
 operation
 of
 the
 genius
 of
 intelligence
 which
 is
 the
 Spirit
 of
 Truth
 the
 soul
 of
 the
 race
 had
 been
 undergoing
 a
 preparation
 like
 unto
 the
 deep
 plowing
 of
 a
 field
 for
 the
 planting
 of
 the
 gospel
 afresh
 The
 principle
 of
 the
 mariners
 compass
 was
 revealed
 by
 the
 Spirit
 the
 material
 embodiment
 thereof
 was
 invented
 by
 man
 and
 by
 its
 aid
 the
 unknown
 oceans
 were
 explored
 Toward
 the
 end
 of
 the
 fifteenth
 century
 Columbus
 was
 led
 by
 the
 inspiration
 of
 God
 to
 the
 discovery
 of
 the
 New
 World
 whereon
 dwelt
 the
 degenerate
 posterity
 of
 Lehi
 a
 darkskinned
 remnant
 of
 the
 house
 of
 Israelthe
 American
 Indians
 In
 due
 time
 the
 good
 ships
 Mayflower
 and
 Speedwell
 brought
 to
 the
 western
 world
 the
 Pilgrim
 Fathers
 as
 the
 vanguard
 of
 a
 host
 escaping
 from
 exile
 and
 seeking
 a
 new
 home
 wherein
 they
 could
 worship
 according
 to
 the
 dictates
 of
 their
 consciences
 The
 coming
 of
 Columbus
 and
 the
 later
 immigration
 of
 the
 Puritan
 Pilgrims
 had
 been
 predicted
 nearly
 six
 hundred
 years
 before
 Christ
 their
 respective
 missions
 had
 been
 as
 truly
 appointed
 unto
 them
 as
 has
 been
 the
 sending
 of
 any
 prophet
 with
 a
 message
 to
 deliver
 and
 a
 work
 to
 do
 The
 war
 between
 the
 American
 Colonies
 and
 the
 Mother
 Country
 and
 the
 victorious
 issue
 thereof
 in
 the
 emancipation
 of
 the
 American
 nation
 once
 and
 forever
 from
 monarchial
 rule
 had
 been
 foretold
 as
 further
 steps
 in
 preparation
 for
 the
 restoration
 of
 the
 gospel
 Time
 was
 allowed
 for
 the
 establishment
 of
 a
 stable
 government
 for
 the
 raising
 up
 of
 men
 chosen
 and
 inspired
 to
 frame
 and
 promulgate
 the
 Constitution
 of
 the
 United
 States
 which
 promises
 to
 every
 man
 a
 full
 measure
 of
 political
 and
 religious
 freedom
 It
 was
 not
 meet
 that
 the
 precious
 seed
 of
 the
 restored
 gospel
 be
 thrown
 upon
 unplowed
 soil
 hardened
 by
 intolerance
 and
 fit
 to
 produce
 only
 thorns
 of
 bigotry
 and
 rank
 weeds
 of
 mental
 and
 spiritual
 serfdom
 The
 gospel
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 is
 the
 embodiment
 of
 liberty
 it
 is
 the
 truth
 that
 shall
 make
 free
 every
 man
 and
 every
 nation
 who
 will
 accept
 and
 obey
 its
 precepts
 At
 the
 appointed
 time
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 and
 His
 Son
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 appeared
 to
 man
 upon
 the
 earth
 and
 inaugurated
 the
 Dispensation
 of
 the
 Fulness
 of
 Times

 Cessation
 of
 Revelation
 on
 the
 Western
 HemisphereThe
 eastern
 world
 had
 lost

 Upon
 the
 land
 of
 North
 America
 four
 hundred

 after

 there
 stood
 at

 one

 as
 a

 a

 Results
 of
 the
 Great
 Apostasy
 Divinely
 Overruled
 for
 Eventual
 GoodThe
 thoughtful
 student
 cannot
 fail
 to
 see
 in
 the
 progress
 of
 the
 great
 apostasy
 and
 its
 results
 the
 existence
 of
 an
 overruling
 power
 operating
 toward
 eventual
 good
 however
 mysterious
 its
 methods
 The
 heartrending
 persecutions
 to
 which
 the
 saints
 were
 subjected
 in
 the
 early
 centuries
 of
 our
 era
 the
 anguish
 the
 torture
 the
 bloodshed
 incurred
 in
 defense
 of
 the
 testimony
 of
 Christ
 the
 rise
 of
 an
 apostate
 church
 blighting
 the
 intellect
 and
 leading
 captive
 the
 souls
 of
 menall
 these
 dread
 conditions
 were
 foreknown
 to
 the
 Lord
 While
 we
 cannot
 say
 or
 believe
 that
 such
 exhibitions
 of
 human
 depravity
 and
 blasphemy
 of
 heart
 were
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 divine
 will
 certainly
 God
 willed
 to
 permit
 full
 scope
 to
 the
 free
 agency
 of
 man
 in
 the
 exercize
 of
 which
 agency
 some
 won
 the
 martyrs
 crown
 and
 others
 filled
 the
 flagon
 of
 their
 iniquity
 to

 Not

 marked
 is
 the
 divine
 permission
 in
 the
 revolts
 and

 that

 Declaration
 of
 a
 General
 Apostasy
 by
 the
 Church
 of
 EnglandThe
 Book
 of
 Homilies
 from
 which
 the
 quotation
 given
 in
 the
 text
 is
 taken
 was
 published
 about
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 sixteenth
 century
 The
 official
 proclamation
 of
 a
 universal
 apostasy
 was
 made
 prominently
 current
 for
 the
 Homilies
 were
 appointed
 to
 be
 read
 in
 churches
 in
 lieu
 of
 sermons
 under
 certain
 conditions
 In
 the
 statement
 cited
 the
 Church
 of
 England
 solemnly
 avers
 that
 a
 state
 of
 apostasy
 affecting
 all
 ages
 sects
 and
 degrees
 throughout
 whole
 Christendom
 had
 prevailed
 for
 eight
 hundred
 years
 prior
 to
 the
 establishment
 of
 the
 church
 making
 the
 declaration
 That
 this
 affirmation
 remains
 effective
 today
 as
 both
 confession
 and
 profession
 of
 the
 Church
 of
 England
 appears
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 homily
 Against
 Peril
 of
 Idolatry
 and
 certain
 other
 homilies
 are
 specifically
 ratified
 and
 endorsed
 and
 withal
 prescribed
 to
 be
 read
 in
 Churches
 by
 the
 Ministers
 diligently
 and
 distinctly
 that
 they
 may
 be
 understanded
 of
 the
 people

 The
 Creed
 of
 AthanasiusAt
 the
 Council
 of
 Nice
 convoked
 by
 the
 emperor
 Constantine
 
 AD
 a
 formal
 statement
 of
 belief
 concerning
 the
 Godhead
 was
 adopted
 Later
 a
 modification
 was
 issued
 known
 as
 the
 Creed
 of
 Athanasius
 and
 though
 the
 authorship
 is
 questioned
 the
 creed
 has
 a
 place
 in
 the
 ritual
 of
 some
 of
 the
 Protestant
 churches
 No
 more
 conclusive
 evidence
 that
 men
 had
 ceased
 to
 know
 God
 need
 be
 adduced
 than
 the
 Athanasian
 Creed
 As
 confessed
 by
 the
 Church
 of
 England
 in
 this
 day
 and
 as
 published
 in
 the
 official
 ritual
 see
 Prayer
 Book
 The
 Creed
 of
 Saint
 Athanasius
 is
 this
 We
 worship
 one
 God
 in
 Trinity
 and
 Trinity
 in
 Unity
 neither
 confounding
 the
 Persons
 nor
 dividing
 the
 Substance
 For
 there
 is
 one
 Person
 of
 the
 Father
 another
 of
 the
 Son
 and
 another
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 But
 the
 Godhead
 of
 the
 Father
 of
 the
 Son
 and
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 is
 all
 one
 the
 Glory
 equal
 the
 Majesty
 coeternal
 Such
 as
 the
 Father
 is
 such
 is
 the
 Son
 and
 such
 is
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 The
 Father
 uncreate
 the
 Son
 uncreate
 and
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 uncreate
 The
 Father
 incomprehensible
 the
 Son
 incomprehensible
 and
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 incomprehensible
 The
 Father
 eternal
 the
 Son
 eternal
 and
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 eternal
 And
 yet
 they
 are
 not
 three
 eternals
 but
 one
 eternal
 As
 also
 there
 are
 not
 three
 incomprehensibles
 nor
 three
 uncreated
 but
 one
 uncreated
 and
 one
 incomprehensible
 So
 likewise
 the
 Father
 is
 Almighty
 the
 Son
 Almighty
 and
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 Almighty
 And
 yet
 they
 are
 not
 three
 Almighties
 but
 one
 Almighty
 So
 the
 Father
 is
 God
 the
 Son
 is
 God
 and
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 is
 God
 And
 yet
 they
 are
 not
 three
 Gods
 but
 one
 God
 So
 likewise
 the
 Father
 is
 Lord
 the
 Son
 Lord
 and
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 Lord
 And
 yet
 not
 three
 Lords
 but
 one
 Lord
 Then
 follows
 this
 strange
 confession
 of
 what
 is
 at
 once
 required
 by
 Christian
 verity
 and
 forbidden
 by
 the
 Catholick
 Religion
 For
 like
 as
 we
 are
 compelled
 by
 the
 Christian
 verity
 to
 acknowledge
 every
 Person
 by
 himself
 to
 be
 God
 and
 Lord
 so
 are
 we
 forbidden
 by
 the
 Catholick
 Religion
 to
 say
 There
 be
 three
 Gods
 or
 three
 Lords
 
 The
 Mission

 Columbus

 ResultsUnto
 Nephi
 son
 of

 was
 shown
 the
 future
 of
 his
 people
 including
 the
 degeneracy
 of
 a
 branch
 thereof
 afterward
 known
 as
 Lamanites
 and
 in
 modern
 times
 as
 American
 Indians
 The
 coming
 of
 a
 man
 from
 among
 the
 Gentiles
 across
 the
 deep
 waters
 was
 revealed
 in
 such
 plainness
 as
 to
 positively
 identify
 that
 man
 with
 Columbus
 and
 the
 coming
 of
 other
 Gentiles
 to
 this
 land
 out
 of
 captivity
 is
 equally
 explicit
 The
 revelation
 is
 thus
 recorded
 by

 to
 whom

 And

 came
 to

 that
 I

 and
 beheld
 many
 waters
 and
 they
 divided
 the
 Gentiles
 from
 the
 seed
 of
 my
 brethren
 And
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 that
 the
 angel
 said
 unto
 me
 Behold
 the
 wrath
 of
 God
 is
 upon
 the
 seed
 of
 thy
 brethren
 And
 I
 looked
 and
 beheld
 a
 man
 among
 the
 Gentiles
 who
 was
 separated
 from
 the
 seed
 of
 my
 brethren
 by
 the
 many
 waters
 and
 I
 beheld
 the
 Spirit
 of
 God
 that
 it
 came
 down
 and
 wrought
 upon
 the
 man
 and
 he
 went
 forth
 upon
 the
 many
 waters
 even
 unto
 the
 seed
 of
 my
 brethren
 who
 were
 in
 the
 promised
 land
 And
 it
 came

 that
 I

 PERSONAL
 MANIFESTATIONS
 OF
 GOD
 THE
 ETERNAL
 FATHER
 AND
 OF
 HIS
 SON
 JESUS
 CHRIST
 IN
 MODERN
 TIMES
 A
 NEW
 DISPENSATION
 In
 the
 year
 of
 our
 Lord
 
 there
 lived
 at
 Manchester
 Ontario
 county
 state
 of
 New
 York
 a
 worthy
 citizen
 named
 Joseph
 Smith
 His
 household
 comprized
 his
 wife
 and
 their
 nine
 children
 The
 third
 son
 and
 fourth
 child
 of
 the
 family
 was
 Joseph
 Smith
 Jr
 who
 at
 the
 time
 of
 which
 we
 speak
 was
 in
 his
 fifteenth
 year
 In
 the
 year
 specified
 New
 York
 and
 adjacent
 states
 were
 swept
 by
 a
 wave
 of
 intense
 agitation
 in
 religious
 matters
 and
 unusual
 zeal
 was
 put
 forth
 by
 ministers
 of
 the
 numerous
 rival
 sects
 to
 win
 converts
 to
 their
 respective
 folds
 The
 boy
 Joseph
 was
 profoundly
 affected
 by
 this
 intense
 excitement
 and
 was
 particularly
 puzzled
 and
 troubled
 over
 the
 spirit
 of
 confusion
 and
 contention
 manifest
 through
 it
 all
 As
 our
 present
 subject
 has
 to
 do
 with
 him
 specifically
 and
 in
 view
 of
 the
 transcendent
 importance
 of
 his
 testimony
 to
 the
 world
 his
 own
 account
 of
 what
 ensued
 is
 given
 herewith
 Some
 time
 in
 the
 second
 year
 after
 our
 removal
 to
 Manchester
 there
 was
 in
 the
 place
 where
 we
 lived
 an
 unusual
 excitement
 on
 the
 subject
 of
 religion
 It
 commenced
 with
 the
 Methodists
 but
 soon
 became
 general
 among
 all
 the
 sects
 in
 that
 region
 of
 country
 Indeed
 the
 whole
 district
 of
 country
 seemed
 affected
 by
 it
 and
 great
 multitudes
 united
 themselves
 to
 the
 different
 religious
 parties
 which
 created
 no
 small
 stir
 and
 division
 amongst
 the
 people
 some
 crying
 Lo
 here
 and
 others
 Lo
 there
 Some
 were
 contending
 for
 the
 Methodist
 faith
 some
 for
 the
 Presbyterian
 and
 some
 for
 the
 Baptist
 For
 notwithstanding
 the
 great
 love
 which
 the
 converts
 to
 these
 different
 faiths
 expressed
 at
 the
 time
 of
 their
 conversion
 and
 the
 great
 zeal
 manifested
 by
 the
 respective
 clergy
 who
 were
 active
 in
 getting
 up
 and
 promoting
 this
 extraordinary
 scene
 of
 religious
 feeling
 in
 order
 to
 have
 everybody
 converted
 as
 they
 were
 pleased
 to
 call
 it
 let
 them
 join
 what
 sect
 they
 pleasedyet
 when
 the
 converts
 began
 to
 file
 off
 some
 to
 one
 party
 and
 some
 to
 another
 it
 was
 seen
 that
 the
 seemingly
 good
 feelings
 of
 both
 the
 priests
 and
 the
 converts
 were
 more
 pretended
 than
 real
 for
 a
 scene
 of
 great
 confusion
 and
 bad
 feeling
 ensued
 priest
 contending
 against
 priest
 and
 convert
 against
 convert
 so
 that
 all
 their
 good
 feelings
 one
 for
 another
 if
 they
 ever
 had
 any
 were
 entirely
 lost
 in
 a
 strife
 of
 words
 and
 a
 contest
 about
 opinions
 I
 was
 at
 this
 time
 in
 my
 fifteenth
 year
 My
 fathers
 family
 was
 proselyted
 to
 the
 Presbyterian
 faith
 and
 four
 of
 them
 joined
 that
 church
 namelymy
 mother
 Lucy
 my
 brothers
 Hyrum
 and
 Samuel
 Harrison
 and
 my
 sister
 Sophronia
 During
 this
 time
 of
 great
 excitement
 my
 mind
 was
 called
 up
 to
 serious
 reflection
 and
 great
 uneasiness
 but
 though
 my
 feelings
 were
 deep
 and
 often
 poignant
 still
 I
 kept
 myself
 aloof
 from
 all
 these
 parties
 though
 I
 attended
 their
 several
 meetings
 as
 often
 as
 occasion
 would
 permit
 In
 process
 of
 time
 my
 mind
 became
 somewhat
 partial
 to
 the
 Methodist
 sect
 and
 I
 felt
 some
 desire
 to
 be
 united
 with
 them
 but
 so
 great
 were
 the
 confusion
 and
 strife
 among
 the
 different
 denominations
 that
 it
 was
 impossible
 for
 a
 person
 young
 as
 I
 was
 and
 so
 unacquainted
 with
 men
 and
 things
 to
 come
 to
 any
 certain
 conclusion
 who
 was
 right
 and
 who
 was
 wrong
 My
 mind
 at
 times
 was
 greatly
 excited
 the
 cry
 and
 tumult
 were
 so
 great
 and
 incessant
 The
 Presbyterians
 were
 most
 decided
 against
 the
 Baptists
 and
 Methodists
 and
 used
 all
 the
 powers
 of
 either
 reason
 or
 sophistry
 to
 prove
 their
 errors
 or
 at
 least
 to
 make
 the
 people
 think
 they
 were
 in
 error
 On
 the
 other
 hand
 the
 Baptists
 and
 Methodists
 in
 their
 turn
 were
 equally
 zealous
 in
 endeavoring
 to
 establish
 their
 own
 tenets
 and
 disprove
 all
 others
 In
 the
 midst
 of
 this
 war
 of
 words
 and
 tumult
 of
 opinions
 I
 often
 said
 to
 myself
 What
 is
 to
 be
 done
 Who
 of
 all
 these
 parties
 are
 right
 or
 are
 they
 all
 wrong
 together
 If
 any
 one
 of
 them
 be
 right
 which
 is
 it
 and
 how
 shall
 I
 know
 it
 While
 I
 was
 laboring
 under
 the
 extreme
 difficulties
 caused
 by
 the
 contests
 of
 these
 parties
 of
 religionists
 I
 was
 one
 day
 reading
 the
 Epistle
 of
 James
 first
 chapter
 and
 fifth
 verse
 which
 reads
 If
 any
 of
 you
 lack
 wisdom
 let
 him
 ask
 of
 God
 that
 giveth
 to
 all
 men
 liberally
 and
 upbraideth
 not
 and
 it
 shall
 be
 given
 him
 Never
 did
 any
 passage
 of
 scripture
 come
 with
 more
 power
 to
 the
 heart
 of
 man
 than
 this
 did
 at
 this
 time
 to
 mine
 It
 seemed
 to
 enter
 with
 great
 force
 into
 every
 feeling
 of
 my
 heart
 I
 reflected
 on
 it
 again
 and
 again
 knowing
 that
 if
 any
 person
 needed
 wisdom
 from
 God
 I
 did
 for
 how
 to
 act
 I
 did
 not
 know
 and
 unless
 I
 could
 get
 more
 wisdom
 than
 I
 then
 had
 I
 would
 never
 know
 for
 the
 teachers
 of
 religion
 of
 the
 different
 sects
 understood
 the
 same
 passages
 of
 scripture
 so
 differently
 as
 to
 destroy
 all
 confidence
 in
 settling
 the
 question
 by
 an
 appeal
 to
 the
 Bible
 At
 length
 I
 came
 to
 the
 conclusion
 that
 I
 must
 either
 remain
 in
 darkness
 and
 confusion
 or
 else
 I
 must
 do
 as
 James
 directs
 that
 is
 ask
 of
 God
 I
 at
 length
 came
 to
 the
 determination
 to
 ask
 of
 God
 concluding
 that
 if
 He
 gave
 wisdom
 to
 them
 that
 lacked
 wisdom
 and
 would
 give
 liberally
 and
 not
 upbraid
 I
 might
 venture
 So
 in
 accordance
 with
 this
 my
 determination
 to
 ask
 of
 God
 I
 retired
 to
 the
 woods
 to
 make
 the
 attempt
 It
 was
 on
 the
 morning
 of
 a
 beautiful
 clear
 day
 early
 in
 the
 spring
 of
 eighteen
 hundred
 and
 twenty
 It
 was
 the
 first
 time
 in
 my
 life
 that
 I
 had
 made
 such
 an
 attempt
 for
 amidst
 all
 my
 anxieties
 I
 had
 never
 as
 yet
 made
 the
 attempt
 to
 pray
 vocally
 After
 I
 had
 retired
 to
 the
 place
 where
 I
 had
 previously
 designed
 to
 go
 having
 looked
 around
 me
 and
 finding
 myself
 alone
 I
 kneeled
 down
 and
 began
 to
 offer
 up
 the
 desires
 of
 my
 heart
 to
 God
 I
 had
 scarcely
 done
 so
 when
 immediately
 I
 was
 seized
 upon
 by
 some
 power
 which
 entirely
 overcame
 me
 and
 had
 such
 an
 astonishing
 influence
 over
 me
 as
 to
 bind
 my
 tongue
 so
 that
 I
 could
 not
 speak
 Thick
 darkness
 gathered
 around
 me
 and
 it
 seemed
 to
 me
 for
 a
 time
 as
 if
 I
 were
 doomed
 to
 sudden
 destruction
 But
 exerting
 all
 my
 powers
 to
 call
 upon
 God
 to
 deliver
 me
 out
 of
 the
 power
 of
 this
 enemy
 which
 had
 seized
 upon
 me
 and
 at
 the
 very
 moment
 when
 I
 was
 ready
 to
 sink
 into
 despair
 and
 abandon
 myself
 to
 destructionnot
 to
 an
 imaginary
 ruin
 but
 to
 the
 power
 of
 some
 actual
 being
 from
 the
 unseen
 world
 who
 had
 such
 marvelous
 power
 as
 I
 had
 never
 before
 felt
 in
 any
 beingjust
 at
 this
 moment
 of
 great
 alarm
 I
 saw
 a
 pillar
 of
 light
 exactly
 over
 my
 head
 above
 the
 brightness
 of
 the
 sun
 which
 descended
 gradually
 until
 it
 fell
 upon
 me
 It
 no
 sooner
 appeared
 than
 I
 found
 myself
 delivered
 from
 the
 enemy
 which
 held
 me
 bound
 When
 the
 light
 rested
 upon
 me
 I
 saw
 two
 personages
 whose
 brightness
 and
 glory
 defy
 all
 description
 standing
 above
 me
 in
 the
 air
 One
 of
 them
 spake
 unto
 me
 calling
 me
 by
 name
 and
 said
 pointing
 to
 the
 otherThis
 is
 my
 beloved
 Son
 hear
 him
 My
 object
 in
 going
 to
 inquire
 of
 the
 Lord
 was
 to
 know
 which
 of
 all
 the
 sects
 was
 right
 that
 I
 might
 know
 which
 to
 join
 No
 sooner
 therefore
 did
 I
 get
 possession
 of
 myself
 so
 as
 to
 be
 able
 to
 speak
 than
 I
 asked
 the
 personages
 who
 stood
 above
 me
 in
 the
 light
 which
 of
 all
 the
 sects
 was
 rightand
 which
 I
 should
 join
 I
 was
 answered
 that
 I
 must
 join
 none
 of
 them
 for
 they
 were
 all
 wrong
 and
 the
 personage
 who
 addressed
 me
 said
 that
 all
 their
 creeds
 were
 an
 abomination
 in
 his
 sight
 that
 those
 professors
 were
 all
 corrupt
 that
 they
 draw
 near
 to
 me
 with
 their
 lips
 but
 their
 hearts
 are
 far
 from
 me
 they
 teach
 for
 doctrines
 the
 commandments
 of
 men
 having
 a
 form
 of
 godliness
 but
 they
 deny
 the
 power
 thereof
 He
 again
 forbade
 me
 to
 join
 with
 any
 of
 them
 and
 many
 other
 things
 did
 he
 say
 unto
 me
 which
 I
 cannot
 write
 at
 this
 time
 When
 I
 came
 to
 myself
 again
 I
 found
 myself
 lying
 on
 my
 back
 looking
 up
 into
 heaven
 Some
 few
 days
 after
 I
 had
 this
 vision
 I
 happened
 to
 be
 in
 company
 with
 one
 of
 the
 Methodist
 preachers
 who
 was
 very
 active
 in
 the
 before
 mentioned
 religious
 excitement
 and
 conversing
 with
 him
 on
 the
 subject
 of
 religion
 I
 took
 occasion
 to
 give
 him
 an
 account
 of
 the
 vision
 which
 I
 had
 had
 I
 was
 greatly
 surprised
 at
 his
 behavior
 he
 treated
 my
 communication
 not
 only
 lightly
 but
 with
 great
 contempt
 saying
 it
 was
 all
 of
 the
 devil
 that
 there
 were
 no
 such
 things
 as
 visions
 or
 revelations
 in
 these
 days
 that
 all
 such
 things
 had
 ceased
 with
 the
 apostles
 and
 that
 there
 would
 never
 be
 any
 more
 of
 them
 I
 soon
 found
 however
 that
 my
 telling
 the
 story
 had
 excited
 a
 great
 deal
 of
 prejudice
 against
 me
 among
 professors
 of
 religion
 and
 was
 the
 cause
 of
 great
 persecution
 which
 continued
 to
 increase
 and
 though
 I
 was
 an
 obscure
 boy
 only
 between
 fourteen
 and
 fifteen
 years
 of
 age
 and
 my
 circumstances
 in
 life
 such
 as
 to
 make
 a
 boy
 of
 no
 consequence
 in
 the
 world
 yet
 men
 of
 high
 standing
 would
 take
 notice
 sufficient
 to
 excite
 the
 public
 mind
 against
 me
 and
 create
 a
 bitter
 persecution
 and
 this
 was
 common
 among
 all
 the
 sectsall
 united
 to
 persecute
 me
 It
 caused
 me
 serious
 reflection
 then
 and
 often
 has
 since
 how
 very
 strange
 it
 was
 that
 an
 obscure
 boy
 of
 a
 little
 over
 fourteen
 years
 of
 age
 and
 one
 too
 who
 was
 doomed
 to
 the
 necessity
 of
 obtaining
 a
 scanty
 maintenance
 by
 his
 daily
 labor
 should
 be
 thought
 a
 character
 of
 sufficient
 importance
 to
 attract
 the
 attention
 of
 the
 great
 ones
 of
 the
 most
 popular
 sects
 of
 the
 day
 and
 in
 a
 manner
 to
 create
 in
 them
 a
 spirit
 of
 the
 most
 bitter
 persecution
 and
 reviling
 But
 strange
 or
 not
 so
 it
 was
 and
 it
 was
 often
 the
 cause
 of
 great
 sorrow
 to
 myself
 However
 it
 was
 nevertheless
 a
 fact
 that
 I
 had
 beheld
 a
 vision
 I
 have
 thought
 since
 that
 I
 felt
 much
 like
 Paul
 when
 he
 made
 his
 defense
 before
 King
 Agrippa
 and
 related
 the
 account
 of
 the
 vision
 he
 had
 when
 he
 saw
 a
 light
 and
 heard
 a
 voice
 but
 still
 there
 were
 but
 few
 who
 believed
 him
 some
 said
 he
 was
 dishonest
 others
 said
 he
 was
 mad
 and
 he
 was
 ridiculed
 and
 reviled
 But
 all
 this
 did
 not
 destroy
 the
 reality
 of
 his
 vision
 He
 had
 seen
 a
 vision
 he
 knew
 he
 had
 and
 all
 the
 persecution
 under
 heaven
 could
 not
 make
 it
 otherwise
 and
 though
 they
 should
 persecute
 him
 unto
 death
 yet
 he
 knew
 and
 would
 know
 to
 his
 latest
 breath
 that
 he
 had
 both
 seen
 a
 light
 and
 heard
 a
 voice
 speaking
 unto
 him
 and
 all
 the
 world
 could
 not
 make
 him
 think
 or
 believe
 otherwise
 So
 it
 was
 with
 me
 I
 had
 actually
 seen
 a
 light
 and
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 that
 light
 I
 saw
 two
 personages
 and
 they
 did
 in
 reality
 speak
 to
 me
 and
 though
 I
 was
 hated
 and
 persecuted
 for
 saying
 that
 I
 had
 seen
 a
 vision
 yet
 it
 was
 true
 and
 while
 they
 were
 persecuting
 me
 reviling
 me
 and
 speaking
 all
 manner
 of
 evil
 against
 me
 falsely
 for
 so
 saying
 I
 was
 led
 to
 say
 in
 my
 heart
 Why
 persecute
 me
 for
 telling
 the
 truth
 I
 have
 actually
 seen
 a
 vision
 and
 who
 am
 I
 that
 I
 can
 withstand
 God
 or
 why
 does
 the
 world
 think
 to
 make
 me
 deny
 what
 I
 have
 actually
 seen
 For
 I
 had
 seen
 a
 vision
 I
 knew
 it
 and
 I
 knew
 that
 God
 knew
 it
 and
 I
 could
 not
 deny
 it
 neither
 dared
 I
 do
 it
 at
 least
 I
 knew
 that
 by
 so
 doing
 I
 would
 offend
 God
 and
 come
 under
 condemnation
 I
 had
 now
 got
 my
 mind
 satisfied
 so
 far
 as
 the
 sectarian
 world
 was
 concerned
 that
 it
 was
 not
 my
 duty
 to
 join
 with
 any
 of
 them
 but
 to
 continue
 as
 I
 was
 until
 further
 directed
 I
 had
 found
 the
 testimony
 of
 James
 to
 be
 true
 that
 a
 man
 who
 lacked
 wisdom
 might
 ask
 of
 God
 and
 obtain
 and
 not
 be
 upbraided
 In
 this
 wise
 was
 ushered
 in
 the
 Dispensation
 of
 the
 Fulness
 of
 Times
 The
 darkness
 of
 the
 long
 night
 of
 apostasy
 was
 dispelled
 the
 glory
 of
 the
 heavens
 once
 more
 illumined
 the
 world
 the
 silence
 of
 centuries
 was
 broken
 the
 voice
 of
 God
 was
 heard
 again
 upon
 the
 earth
 In
 the
 spring
 of
 AD
 
 there
 was
 one
 mortal
 a
 boy
 not
 quite
 fifteen
 years
 old
 who
 knew
 as
 well
 as
 that
 he
 lived
 that
 the
 current
 human
 conception
 of
 Deity
 as
 an
 incorporeal
 essence
 of
 something
 possessing
 neither
 definite
 shape
 nor
 tangible
 substance
 was
 as
 devoid
 of
 truth
 in
 respect
 to
 both
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Son
 as
 its
 statement
 in
 formulated
 creeds
 was
 incomprehensible
 The
 boy
 Joseph
 knew
 that
 both
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 and
 His
 glorified
 Son
 Jesus
 Christ
 were
 in
 form
 and
 stature
 perfect
 Men
 and
 that
 in
 Their
 physical
 likeness
 mankind
 had
 been
 created
 in
 the
 flesh
 He
 knew
 further
 that
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Son
 were
 individual
 Personages
 each
 distinct
 from
 the
 othera
 truth
 fully
 attested
 by
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 during
 His
 mortal
 existence
 but
 which
 had
 been
 obscured
 if
 not
 buried
 by
 the
 sophistries
 of
 human
 unbelief
 He
 realized
 that
 the
 unity
 of
 the
 Godhead
 was
 a
 oneness
 of
 perfection
 in
 purpose
 plan
 and
 action
 as
 the
 scriptures
 declare
 it
 to
 be
 and
 not
 an
 impossible
 union
 of
 personalities
 as
 generations
 of
 false
 teachers
 had
 tried
 to
 impress
 This
 resplendent
 theophany
 confirmed
 the
 fact
 of
 a
 universal
 apostasy
 with
 the
 inevitable
 corollarythat
 the
 Church
 of
 Christ
 was
 nowhere
 existent
 upon
 the
 earth
 It
 effectively
 dissipated
 the
 delusion
 that
 direct
 revelation
 from
 the
 heavens
 had
 forever
 ceased
 and
 affirmatively
 proved
 the
 actuality
 of
 personal
 communication
 between
 God
 and
 mortals
 For
 the
 fourth
 time
 since
 the
 Saviors
 birth
 in
 the
 flesh
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 Father
 had
 attested
 the
 Sons
 authority
 in
 matters
 pertaining
 to
 earth
 and
 man
 In
 this
 latterday
 revelation
 of
 Himself
 as
 on
 the
 earlier
 occasions
 the
 Father
 did
 no
 more
 than
 affirm
 the
 fact
 of
 the
 Sons
 identity
 and
 command
 that
 He
 be
 obeyed
 A
 MESSENGER
 SENT
 FROM
 THE
 PRESENCE
 OF
 GOD
 For
 about
 three
 and
 a
 half
 years
 following
 the
 glorious
 appearing
 of
 the
 Father
 and
 the
 Son
 to
 Joseph
 Smith
 the
 youthful
 revelator
 was
 left
 to
 himself
 so
 far
 as
 further
 manifestations
 from
 heaven
 were
 concerned
 The
 period
 was
 one
 of
 probation
 He
 was
 subjected
 to
 the
 sneers
 of
 youths
 of
 his
 age
 and
 to
 aggressive
 persecution
 on
 the
 part
 of
 older
 men
 who
 as
 he
 very
 justly
 and
 somewhat
 accusingly
 remarks
 ought
 to
 have
 been
 my
 friends
 and
 to
 have
 treated
 me
 kindly
 and
 if
 they
 supposed
 me
 to
 be
 deluded
 to
 have
 endeavored
 in
 a
 proper
 and
 affectionate
 manner
 to
 have
 reclaimed
 me
 He
 pursued
 his
 usual
 vocation
 that
 of
 farm
 work
 in
 association
 with
 his
 father
 and
 brothers
 from
 whom
 he
 received
 kindness
 consideration
 and
 sympathy
 and
 in
 spite
 of
 raillery
 abuse
 and
 denunciation
 from
 the
 community
 at
 large
 he
 remained
 firm
 and
 faithful
 in
 his
 solemn
 avouchment
 that
 he
 had
 seen
 and
 heard
 both
 the
 Eternal
 Father
 and
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 and
 that
 he
 had
 been
 instructed
 to
 join
 none
 of
 the
 contending
 sects
 or
 churches
 because
 they
 were
 all
 fundamentally
 wrong
 On
 the
 night
 of
 the
 st
 of
 September
 
 while
 engaged
 in
 fervent
 prayer
 to
 God
 in
 the
 solitude
 of
 his
 chamber
 Joseph
 observed
 the
 room
 become
 illuminated
 until
 the
 light
 exceeded
 that
 of
 a
 cloudless
 noon
 A
 glorious
 personage
 appeared
 within
 the
 room
 standing
 a
 little
 space
 above
 the
 floor
 Both
 the
 body
 of
 the
 visitant
 and
 the
 loose
 robe
 he
 wore
 were
 of
 exquisite
 whiteness
 Calling
 Joseph
 by
 name
 he
 announced
 himself
 as
 Moroni
 a
 messenger
 sent
 from
 the
 presence
 of
 God
 and
 informed
 the
 young
 man
 that
 the
 Lord
 had
 a
 work
 for
 him
 to
 do
 and
 that
 his
 name
 should
 come
 to
 be
 spoken
 of
 both
 for
 good
 and
 for
 evil
 among
 all
 nations
 kindreds
 and
 tongues
 The
 angel
 told
 of
 a
 record
 engraven
 on
 plates
 of
 gold
 which
 contained
 an
 account
 of
 the
 former
 inhabitants
 of
 the
 American
 continent
 and
 the
 fulness
 of
 the
 everlasting
 gospel
 as
 delivered
 by
 the
 Savior
 to
 those
 ancient
 people
 and
 furthermore
 that
 with
 the
 record
 were
 a
 breastplate
 and
 the
 Urim
 and
 Thummim
 which
 had
 been
 prepared
 by
 divine
 instrumentality
 for
 use
 in
 translating
 the
 book
 The
 place
 at
 which
 the
 plates
 and
 the
 other
 sacred
 things
 were
 deposited
 was
 shown
 to
 Joseph
 in
 vision
 and
 so
 clear
 was
 the
 demonstration
 that
 he
 readily
 recognized
 the
 spot
 when
 he
 visited
 it
 next
 day
 The
 angel
 quoted
 several
 passages
 from
 the
 Old
 and
 one
 from
 the
 New
 Testament
 some
 verbatim
 and
 some
 with
 small
 variations
 from
 the
 Biblical
 version
 Josephs
 statement
 concerning
 the
 scriptures
 cited
 by
 Moroni
 is
 as
 follows
 He
 first
 quoted
 part
 of
 the
 third
 chapter
 of
 Malachi
 and
 he
 quoted
 also
 the
 fourth
 or
 last
 chapter
 of
 the
 same
 prophecy
 though
 with
 a
 little
 variation
 from
 the
 way
 it
 reads
 in
 our
 Bibles
 Instead
 of
 quoting
 the
 first
 verse
 as
 it
 reads
 in
 our
 books
 he
 quoted
 it
 thus
 For
 behold
 the
 day
 cometh
 that
 shall
 burn
 as
 an
 oven
 and
 all
 the
 proud
 yea
 and
 all
 that
 do
 wickedly
 shall
 burn
 as
 stubble
 for
 they
 that
 come
 shall
 burn
 them
 saith
 the
 Lord
 of
 Hosts
 that
 it
 shall
 leave
 them
 neither
 root
 nor
 branch
 And
 again
 he
 quoted
 the
 fifth
 verse
 thus
 Behold
 I
 will
 reveal
 unto
 you
 the
 Priesthood
 by
 the
 hand
 of
 Elijah
 the
 prophet
 before
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 great
 and
 dreadful
 day
 of
 the
 Lord
 He
 also
 quoted
 the
 next
 verse
 differently
 And
 he
 shall
 plant
 in
 the
 hearts
 of
 the
 children
 the
 promises
 made
 to
 the
 fathers
 and
 the
 hearts
 of
 the
 children
 shall
 turn
 to
 their
 fathers
 if
 it
 were
 not
 so
 the
 whole
 earth
 would
 be
 utterly
 wasted
 at
 his
 coming
 In
 addition
 to
 these
 he
 quoted
 the
 eleventh
 chapter
 of
 Isaiah
 saying
 that
 it
 was
 about
 to
 be
 fulfilled
 He
 quoted
 also
 the
 third
 chapter
 of
 Acts
 twentysecond
 and
 twentythird
 verses
 precisely
 as
 they
 stand
 in
 our
 New
 Testament
 He
 said
 that
 that
 prophet
 was
 Christ
 but
 the
 day
 had
 not
 yet
 come
 when
 they
 who
 would
 not
 hear
 his
 voice
 should
 be
 cut
 off
 from
 among
 the
 people
 but
 soon
 would
 come
 He
 also
 quoted
 the
 second
 chapter
 of
 Joel
 from
 the
 twentyeighth
 verse
 to
 the
 last
 He
 also
 said
 that
 this
 was
 not
 yet
 fulfilled
 but
 was
 soon
 to
 be
 And
 he
 further
 stated
 that
 the
 fulness
 of
 the
 Gentiles
 was
 soon
 to
 come
 in
 The
 messenger
 departed
 and
 the
 light
 disappeared
 with
 him
 Twice
 during
 the
 same
 night
 however
 the
 angel
 returned
 each
 time
 repeating
 what
 had
 been
 said
 at
 his
 first
 appearing
 and
 adding
 words
 of
 instruction
 and
 caution
 On
 the
 next
 day
 Moroni
 appeared
 to
 the
 young
 man
 again
 and
 directed
 him
 to
 inform
 his
 father
 of
 the
 visitations
 and
 commandments
 he
 had
 received
 Josephs
 father
 instructed
 him
 to
 obey
 the
 messengers
 instructions
 and
 testified
 that
 they
 were
 given
 of
 God
 Joseph
 then
 went
 to
 the
 locality
 specified
 by
 the
 angel
 on
 the
 side
 of
 a
 hill
 called
 in
 the
 record
 Cumorah
 and
 immediately
 identified
 the
 spot
 that
 had
 been
 shown
 him
 in
 vision
 By
 the
 aid
 of
 a
 lever
 he
 removed
 a
 large
 stone
 which
 proved
 to
 be
 the
 cover
 of
 a
 stone
 box
 wherein
 lay
 the
 plates
 and
 other
 articles
 described
 by
 Moroni
 The
 angel
 appeared
 at
 the
 place
 and
 forbade
 Joseph
 to
 remove
 the
 contents
 of
 the
 box
 at
 that
 time
 The
 young
 man
 replaced
 the
 massive
 stone
 lid
 and
 left
 the
 spot
 Four
 years
 later
 the
 plates
 the
 Urim
 and
 Thummim
 and
 the
 breastplate
 were
 delivered
 into
 Josephs
 keeping
 by
 the
 angel
 Moroni
 This
 Moroni
 who
 now
 came
 as
 a
 resurrected
 being
 was
 the
 last
 survivor
 of
 the
 Nephite
 nation
 he
 had
 completed
 the
 record
 and
 then
 shortly
 before
 his
 death
 had
 hidden
 away
 the
 same
 in
 the
 hill
 Cumorah
 whence
 it
 was
 brought
 forth
 through
 his
 instrumentality
 and
 delivered
 to
 the
 modern
 prophet
 and
 seer
 Joseph
 Smith
 September
 
 
 That
 record
 or
 strictly
 speaking
 a
 part
 thereof
 is
 now
 accessible
 to
 all
 it
 has
 been
 translated
 through
 divine
 instrumentality
 and
 is
 now
 published
 in
 many
 languages
 as
 the
 Book
 of
 Mormon
 THE
 AARONIC
 PRIESTHOOD
 CONFERRED
 BY
 JOHN
 THE
 BAPTIST
 On
 the
 th
 of
 May
 
 Joseph
 Smith
 and
 his
 scribe
 in
 the
 work
 of
 translating
 the
 Nephite
 record
 Oliver
 Cowdery
 retired
 to
 a
 secluded
 glade
 to
 pray
 Their
 special
 purpose
 was
 to
 inquire
 of
 the
 Lord
 concerning
 the
 ordinance
 of
 baptism
 for
 the
 remission
 of
 sins
 some
 account
 of
 which
 they
 had
 found
 on
 the
 plates
 Joseph
 writes
 While
 we
 were
 thus
 employed
 praying
 and
 calling
 upon
 the
 Lord
 a
 messenger
 from
 heaven
 descended
 in
 a
 cloud
 of
 light
 and
 having
 laid
 his
 hands
 upon
 us
 he
 ordained
 us
 saying
 Upon
 you
 my
 fellow
 servants
 in
 the
 name
 of
 Messiah
 I
 confer
 the
 Priesthood
 of
 Aaron
 which
 holds
 the
 keys
 of
 the
 ministering
 of
 angels
 and
 of
 the
 Gospel
 of
 repentance
 and
 of
 baptism
 by
 immersion
 for
 the
 remission
 of
 sins
 and
 this
 shall
 never
 be
 taken
 again
 from
 the
 earth
 until
 the
 sons
 of
 Levi
 do
 offer
 again
 an
 offering
 unto
 the
 Lord
 in
 righteousness
 The
 angelic
 visitor
 stated
 that
 his
 name
 was
 John
 the
 same
 who
 is
 designated
 in
 the
 New
 Testament
 John
 the
 Baptist
 and
 that
 he
 had
 acted
 in
 ordaining
 the
 two
 under
 the
 direction
 of
 Peter
 James
 and
 John
 who
 held
 the
 keys
 of
 the
 Higher
 or
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 He
 explained
 that
 the
 Aaronic
 Priesthood
 did
 not
 comprize
 the
 power
 of
 laying
 on
 hands
 for
 the
 gift
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 but
 he
 predicted
 that
 the
 Higher
 Priesthood
 having
 this
 power
 would
 be
 conferred
 later
 By
 his
 express
 direction
 Joseph
 baptized
 Oliver
 and
 the
 latter
 in
 turn
 baptized
 Joseph
 by
 immersion
 in
 water
 THE
 MELCHIZEDEK
 PRIESTHOOD
 CONFERRED
 BY
 PETER
 JAMES
 AND
 JOHN
 Shortly
 after
 their
 ordination
 to
 the
 Lesser
 or
 Aaronic
 Priesthood
 Joseph
 Smith
 and
 Oliver
 Cowdery
 were
 visited
 by
 the
 presiding
 apostles
 of
 old
 Peter
 James
 and
 John
 who
 conferred
 upon
 them
 the
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 and
 ordained
 them
 to
 the
 Holy
 Apostleship
 In
 a
 later
 revelation
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 thus
 specifically
 acknowledges
 the
 respective
 ordinations
 as
 having
 been
 done
 by
 His
 will
 and
 commandment
 Which
 John
 I
 have
 sent
 unto
 you
 my
 servants
 Joseph
 Smith
 jun
 and
 Oliver
 Cowdery
 to
 ordain
 you
 unto
 this
 first
 priesthood
 which
 you
 have
 received
 that
 you
 might
 be
 called
 and
 ordained
 even
 as
 Aaron
 And
 also
 with
 Peter
 and
 James
 and
 John
 whom
 I
 have
 sent
 unto
 you
 by
 whom
 I
 have
 ordained
 you
 and
 confirmed
 you
 to
 be
 apostles
 and
 especial
 witnesses
 of
 my
 name
 and
 bear
 the
 keys
 of
 your
 ministry
 and
 of
 the
 same
 things
 which
 I
 revealed
 unto
 them
 Unto
 whom
 I
 have
 committed
 the
 keys
 of
 my
 kingdom
 and
 a
 dispensation
 of
 the
 gospel
 for
 the
 last
 times
 and
 for
 the
 fulness
 of
 times
 in
 the
 which
 I
 will
 gather
 together
 in
 one
 all
 things
 both
 which
 are
 in
 heaven
 and
 which
 are
 on
 the
 earth
 ESTABLISHMENT
 OF
 THE
 CHURCH
 OF
 JESUS
 CHRIST
 OF
 LATTERDAY
 SAINTS
 On
 the
 sixth
 day
 of
 April
 AD
 
 the
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 of
 Latterday
 Saints
 was
 formally
 organized
 at
 Fayette
 Seneca
 county
 New
 York
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 secular
 law
 governing
 the
 establishment
 of
 religious
 associations
 The
 persons
 actually
 participating
 in
 the
 organization
 numbered
 but
 six
 such
 being
 the
 minimum
 required
 by
 law
 in
 such
 an
 undertaking
 many
 others
 were
 present
 however
 some
 of
 whom
 had
 already
 received
 the
 ordinance
 of
 baptism
 for
 the
 remission
 of
 sins
 By
 revelation
 to
 Joseph
 Smith
 the
 Lord
 had
 previously
 specified
 the
 day
 on
 which
 the
 organization
 was
 to
 be
 effected
 and
 had
 made
 known
 His
 plan
 of
 Church
 governmentwith
 detailed
 instructions
 as
 to
 the
 requisite
 conditions
 for
 membership
 the
 indispensability
 of
 baptism
 by
 immersion
 and
 the
 precise
 manner
 in
 which
 the
 initiatory
 ordinance
 was
 to
 be
 administered
 the
 manner
 of
 confirming
 baptized
 believers
 as
 members
 of
 the
 Church
 the
 duties
 of
 elders
 priests
 teachers
 and
 deacons
 in
 the
 Church
 the
 exact
 procedure
 to
 be
 followed
 in
 the
 administration
 of
 the
 Sacrament
 of
 the
 Lords
 Supper
 the
 order
 of
 Church
 discipline
 and
 the
 method
 of
 transferring
 members
 from
 one
 branch
 to
 another
 The
 baptized
 converts
 present
 at
 the
 organization
 were
 called
 upon
 to
 express
 their
 acceptance
 or
 rejection
 of
 Joseph
 Smith
 and
 Oliver
 Cowdery
 as
 elders
 in
 the
 Church
 and
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 unanimous
 vote
 in
 the
 affirmative
 the
 ordination
 or
 setting
 apart
 of
 these
 two
 men
 as
 respectively
 first
 and
 second
 elder
 in
 the
 new
 organization
 was
 performed
 While
 the
 Book
 of
 Mormon
 had
 been
 in
 course
 of
 translation
 particularly
 during
 the
 two
 years
 immediately
 preceding
 the
 organization
 of
 the
 Church
 several
 revelations
 had
 been
 given
 through
 Joseph
 the
 prophet
 and
 seer
 relating
 to
 the
 work
 of
 translation
 and
 to
 the
 preparatory
 labor
 necessary
 to
 the
 establishment
 of
 the
 Church
 as
 an
 institution
 among
 men
 The
 Author
 of
 these
 several
 revelations
 declared
 Himself
 definitely
 to
 be
 Jesus
 Christ
 God
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 the
 Redeemer
 the
 Light
 and
 Life
 of
 the
 World
 Alpha
 and
 Omega
 Christ
 the
 Lord
 the
 Lord
 and
 Savior
 As
 early
 as
 AD
 
 the
 calling
 of
 the
 Twelve
 Apostles
 was
 indicated
 and
 appointment
 was
 made
 for
 the
 searching
 out
 of
 the
 Twelve
 who
 should
 stand
 before
 the
 world
 as
 special
 witnesses
 of
 the
 Christ
 these
 were
 subsequently
 ordained
 to
 the
 Holy
 Apostleship
 and
 the
 council
 or
 quorum
 of
 the
 Twelve
 has
 been
 recognized
 and
 instructions
 concerning
 their
 exalted
 duties
 have
 been
 given
 in
 numerous
 revelations
 of
 later
 dates
 In
 such
 manner
 has
 the
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 been
 reestablished
 upon
 the
 earth
 with
 all
 the
 powers
 and
 authority
 pertaining
 to
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 as
 committed
 by
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 to
 His
 apostles
 in
 the
 period
 of
 His
 personal
 ministry
 The
 inauguration
 of
 a
 new
 dispensation
 of
 the
 gospel
 with
 a
 restoration
 of
 the
 Priesthood
 was
 absolutely
 necessary
 since
 through
 the
 apostasy
 of
 the
 Primitive
 Church
 there
 lived
 not
 a
 man
 empowered
 to
 speak
 or
 administer
 in
 the
 name
 of
 God
 or
 His
 Christ
 John
 the
 Revelator
 saw
 in
 his
 vision
 of
 the
 last
 days
 an
 angel
 bringing
 anew
 the
 everlasting
 gospel
 to
 preach
 unto
 them
 that
 dwell
 on
 the
 earth
 and
 to
 every
 nation
 and
 kindred
 and
 tongue
 and
 people
 saying
 with
 a
 loud
 voice
 Fear
 God
 and
 give
 glory
 to
 him
 for
 the
 hour
 of
 his
 judgment
 is
 come
 and
 worship
 him
 that
 made
 heaven
 and
 earth
 and
 the
 sea
 and
 the
 fountains
 of
 waters
 Such
 an
 angelic
 embassage
 would
 have
 been
 but
 a
 needless
 and
 empty
 display
 and
 therefore
 an
 impossibility
 had
 the
 everlasting
 gospel
 remained
 upon
 the
 earth
 with
 its
 powers
 of
 priesthood
 perpetuated
 by
 succession
 The
 scriptural
 assurances
 of
 a
 restoration
 in
 the
 last
 days
 through
 direct
 bestowal
 from
 the
 heavens
 is
 conclusive
 proof
 of
 the
 actuality
 of
 the
 universal
 apostasy
 Moroni
 came
 to
 Joseph
 Smith
 as
 a
 messenger
 sent
 from
 the
 presence
 of
 God
 and
 delivered
 a
 record
 containing
 the
 fulness
 of
 the
 everlasting
 gospel
 as
 it
 had
 been
 imparted
 to
 the
 Lords
 people
 in
 ancient
 times
 and
 the
 worldwide
 distribution
 of
 the
 Book
 of
 Mormon
 and
 of
 other
 publications
 embodying
 the
 revealed
 word
 in
 modern
 times
 and
 the
 ministry
 of
 thousands
 who
 labor
 in
 the
 authority
 of
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 combine
 as
 the
 loud
 voice
 addressed
 to
 every
 nation
 crying
 Fear
 God
 and
 give
 glory
 to
 him
 for
 the
 hour
 of
 his
 judgment
 is
 come
 FURTHER
 COMMUNICATIONS
 FROM
 THE
 HEAVENS
 TO
 MAN
 Following
 the
 organization
 of
 the
 Church
 as
 heretofore
 described
 direct
 communication
 between
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 Christ
 and
 His
 prophet
 Joseph
 was
 frequent
 as
 the
 needs
 of
 the
 Church
 required
 Numerous
 revelations
 were
 given
 and
 these
 are
 accessible
 to
 all
 who
 will
 read
 A
 marvelous
 manifestation
 was
 granted
 to
 the
 prophet
 and
 his
 associate
 in
 the
 presidency
 of
 the
 Church
 Sidney
 Rigdon
 the
 record
 of
 which
 appears
 as
 follows
 We
 Joseph
 Smith
 jun
 and
 Sidney
 Rigdon
 being
 in
 the
 Spirit
 on
 the
 sixteenth
 of
 February
 in
 the
 year
 of
 our
 Lord
 one
 thousand
 eight
 hundred
 and
 thirtytwo
 by
 the
 power
 of
 the
 Spirit
 our
 eyes
 were
 opened
 and
 our
 understandings
 were
 enlightened
 so
 as
 to
 see
 and
 understand
 the
 things
 of
 Godeven
 those
 things
 which
 were
 from
 the
 beginning
 before
 the
 world
 was
 which
 were
 ordained
 of
 the
 Father
 through
 his
 Only
 Begotten
 Son
 who
 was
 in
 the
 bosom
 of
 the
 Father
 even
 from
 the
 beginning
 of
 whom
 we
 bear
 record
 and
 the
 record
 which
 we
 bear
 is
 the
 fulness
 of
 the
 gospel
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 who
 is
 the
 Son
 whom
 we
 saw
 and
 with
 whom
 we
 conversed
 in
 the
 heavenly
 vision
 For
 while
 we
 were
 doing
 the
 work
 of
 translation
 which
 the
 Lord
 had
 appointed
 unto
 us
 we
 came
 to
 the
 twentyninth
 verse
 of
 the
 fifth
 chapter
 of
 John
 which
 was
 given
 unto
 us
 as
 follows
 Speaking
 of
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 dead
 concerning
 those
 who
 shall
 hear
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 and
 shall
 come
 forth
 they
 who
 have
 done
 good
 in
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 just
 and
 they
 who
 have
 done
 evil
 in
 the
 resurrection
 of
 the
 unjust
 Now
 this
 caused
 us
 to
 marvel
 for
 it
 was
 given
 unto
 us
 of
 the
 Spirit
 and
 while
 we
 meditated
 upon
 these
 things
 the
 Lord
 touched
 the
 eyes
 of
 our
 understandings
 and
 they
 were
 opened
 and
 the
 glory
 of
 the
 Lord
 shone
 round
 about
 and
 we
 beheld
 the
 glory
 of
 the
 Son
 on
 the
 right
 hand
 of
 the
 Father
 and
 received
 of
 his
 fulness
 and
 saw
 the
 holy
 angels
 and
 they
 who
 are
 sanctified
 before
 his
 throne
 worshiping
 God
 and
 the
 Lamb
 who
 worship
 him
 for
 ever
 and
 ever
 And
 now
 after
 the
 many
 testimonies
 which
 have
 been
 given
 of
 him
 this
 is
 the
 testimony
 last
 of
 all
 which
 we
 give
 of
 him
 that
 he
 lives
 for
 we
 saw
 him
 even
 on
 the
 right
 hand
 of
 God
 and
 we
 heard
 the
 voice
 bearing
 record
 that
 he
 is
 the
 Only
 Begotten
 of
 the
 Fatherthat
 by
 him
 and
 through
 him
 and
 of
 him
 the
 worlds
 are
 and
 were
 created
 and
 the
 inhabitants
 thereof
 are
 begotten
 sons
 and
 daughters
 unto
 God
 The
 vision
 was
 followed
 by
 further
 revelation
 both
 through
 sight
 and
 hearing
 and
 the
 Lord
 showed
 unto
 His
 servants
 and
 proclaimed
 aloud
 the
 fate
 of
 the
 wicked
 and
 the
 characteristic
 features
 of
 the
 varied
 degrees
 of
 glory
 provided
 for
 the
 souls
 of
 mankind
 in
 the
 hereafter
 The
 several
 states
 of
 graded
 honor
 and
 exaltation
 pertaining
 to
 the
 telestial
 the
 terrestrial
 and
 the
 celestial
 kingdoms
 were
 revealed
 and
 the
 ancient
 scriptures
 relating
 thereto
 were
 illumined
 with
 the
 new
 light
 of
 simplicity
 and
 literalness
 PERSONAL
 APPEARING
 OF
 THE
 LORD
 JESUS
 CHRIST
 IN
 THE
 KIRTLAND
 TEMPLE
 In
 less
 than
 three
 and
 a
 half
 years
 after
 its
 organization
 the
 Church
 began
 the
 erection
 of
 the
 first
 temple
 of
 modern
 times
 at
 Kirtland
 Ohio
 The
 work
 was
 undertaken
 in
 compliance
 with
 a
 revelation
 from
 the
 Lord
 requiring
 this
 labor
 at
 the
 hands
 of
 His
 people
 The
 Church
 membership
 was
 small
 the
 people
 were
 in
 poverty
 the
 period
 was
 one
 of
 determined
 opposition
 and
 relentless
 persecution
 Be
 it
 understood
 that
 to
 the
 Latterday
 Saints
 a
 temple
 is
 more
 than
 chapel
 church
 tabernacle
 or
 cathedral
 it
 is
 no
 place
 of
 common
 assembly
 even
 for
 purposes
 of
 congregational
 worship
 but
 an
 edifice
 sacred
 to
 the
 ordinances
 of
 the
 Holy
 Priesthooddistinctively
 and
 essentially
 a
 House
 of
 the
 Lord
 The
 temple
 at
 Kirtland
 stands
 today
 a
 substantial
 and
 stately
 building
 but
 it
 is
 no
 longer
 in
 possession
 of
 the
 people
 who
 reared
 it
 by
 unmeasured
 sacrifice
 of
 time
 substance
 and
 effort
 extending
 through
 years
 of
 selfdenial
 and
 suffering
 Its
 cornerstones
 were
 laid
 July
 
 
 and
 the
 completed
 structure
 was
 dedicated
 March
 
 
 The
 dedicatory
 service
 was
 made
 ever
 memorable
 by
 a
 Pentecostal
 outpouring
 of
 the
 Spirit
 of
 the
 Lord
 accompanied
 by
 the
 visible
 presence
 of
 angels
 In
 the
 evening
 of
 the
 same
 day
 the
 several
 quorums
 of
 priesthood
 assembled
 in
 the
 house
 and
 a
 yet
 greater
 manifestation
 of
 divine
 power
 and
 glory
 was
 witnessed
 On
 the
 succeeding
 SundayApril
 
 after
 a
 service
 of
 solemn
 worship
 including
 the
 administration
 of
 the
 Lords
 Supper
 the
 prophet
 Joseph
 and
 his
 counselor
 Oliver
 Cowdery
 retired
 for
 prayer
 within
 the
 veils
 enclosing
 the
 platform
 and
 pulpit
 reserved
 for
 the
 presiding
 authorities
 of
 the
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 They
 bear
 this
 solemn
 testimony
 to
 the
 personal
 appearing
 of
 the
 Lord
 Jesus
 Christ
 at
 that
 time
 and
 place
 The
 veil
 was
 taken
 from
 our
 minds
 and
 the
 eyes
 of
 our
 understanding
 were
 opened
 We
 saw
 the
 Lord
 standing
 upon
 the
 breast
 work
 of
 the
 pulpit
 before
 us
 and
 under
 his
 feet
 was
 a
 paved
 work
 of
 pure
 gold
 in
 color
 like
 amber
 His
 eyes
 were
 as
 a
 flame
 of
 fire
 the
 hair
 of
 his
 head
 was
 white
 like
 the
 pure
 snow
 his
 countenance
 shone
 above
 the
 brightness
 of
 the
 sun
 and
 his
 voice
 was
 as
 the
 sound
 of
 the
 rushing
 of
 great
 waters
 even
 the
 voice
 of
 Jehovah
 sayingI
 am
 the
 first
 and
 the
 last
 I
 am
 he
 who
 liveth
 I
 am
 he
 who
 was
 slain
 I
 am
 your
 advocate
 with
 the
 Father
 Behold
 your
 sins
 are
 forgiven
 you
 you
 are
 clean
 before
 me
 therefore
 lift
 up
 your
 heads
 and
 rejoice
 let
 the
 hearts
 of
 your
 brethren
 rejoice
 and
 let
 the
 hearts
 of
 all
 my
 people
 rejoice
 who
 have
 with
 their
 might
 built
 this
 house
 to
 my
 name
 For
 behold
 I
 have
 accepted
 this
 house
 and
 my
 name
 shall
 be
 here
 and
 I
 will
 manifest
 myself
 to
 my
 people
 in
 mercy
 in
 this
 house
 Yea
 I
 will
 appear
 unto
 my
 servants
 and
 speak
 unto
 them
 with
 mine
 own
 voice
 if
 my
 people
 will
 keep
 my
 commandments
 and
 do
 not
 pollute
 this
 holy
 house
 Yea
 the
 hearts
 of
 thousands
 and
 tens
 of
 thousands
 shall
 greatly
 rejoice
 in
 consequence
 of
 the
 blessings
 which
 shall
 be
 poured
 out
 and
 the
 endowment
 with
 which
 my
 servants
 have
 been
 endowed
 in
 this
 house
 and
 the
 fame
 of
 this
 house
 shall
 spread
 to
 foreign
 lands
 and
 this
 is
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 blessing
 which
 shall
 be
 poured
 out
 upon
 the
 heads
 of
 my
 people
 Even
 so
 Amen
 After
 the
 Saviors
 withdrawal
 the
 two
 mortal
 prophets
 were
 visited
 by
 glorified
 beings
 each
 of
 whom
 had
 officiated
 on
 earth
 as
 a
 specially
 commissioned
 servant
 of
 Jehovah
 and
 now
 came
 to
 confer
 the
 authority
 of
 his
 particular
 office
 upon
 Joseph
 and
 Oliver
 thus
 uniting
 all
 the
 powers
 and
 authorities
 of
 olden
 dispensations
 in
 the
 restored
 Church
 of
 Christ
 which
 characterizes
 the
 last
 and
 greatest
 dispensation
 of
 history
 This
 is
 the
 record
 After
 this
 vision
 closed
 the
 heavens
 were
 again
 opened
 unto
 us
 and
 Moses
 appeared
 before
 us
 and
 committed
 unto
 us
 the
 keys
 of
 the
 gathering
 of
 Israel
 from
 the
 four
 parts
 of
 the
 earth
 and
 the
 leading
 of
 the
 ten
 tribes
 from
 the
 land
 of
 the
 north
 After
 this
 Elias
 appeared
 and
 committed
 the
 dispensation
 of
 the
 gospel
 of
 Abraham
 saying
 that
 in
 us
 and
 our
 seed
 all
 generations
 after
 us
 should
 be
 blessed
 After
 this
 vision
 had
 closed
 another
 great
 and
 glorious
 vision
 burst
 upon
 us
 for
 Elijah
 the
 prophet
 who
 was
 taken
 to
 heaven
 without
 tasting
 death
 stood
 before
 us
 and
 saidBehold
 the
 time
 has
 fully
 come
 which
 was
 spoken
 of
 by
 the
 mouth
 of
 Malachi
 testifying
 that
 he
 Elijah
 should
 be
 sent
 before
 the
 great
 and
 dreadful
 day
 of
 the
 Lord
 come
 to
 turn
 the
 hearts
 of
 the
 fathers
 to
 the
 children
 and
 the
 children
 to
 the
 fathers
 lest
 the
 whole
 earth
 be
 smitten
 with
 a
 curse
 Therefore
 the
 keys
 of
 this
 dispensation
 are
 committed
 into
 your
 hands
 and
 by
 this
 ye
 may
 know
 that
 the
 great
 and
 dreadful
 day
 of
 the
 Lord
 is
 near
 even
 at
 the
 doors
 JESUS
 THE
 CHRIST
 IS
 WITH
 HIS
 CHURCH
 TODAY
 Right
 gloriously
 has
 the
 Lord
 brought
 about
 a
 fulfilment
 of
 the
 promises
 uttered
 through
 the
 mouths
 of
 His
 holy
 prophets
 in
 bygone
 agesto
 restore
 the
 gospel
 with
 all
 its
 former
 blessings
 and
 privileges
 to
 bestow
 anew
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 with
 authority
 to
 administer
 in
 the
 name
 of
 God
 to
 reestablish
 the
 Church
 bearing
 His
 name
 and
 founded
 upon
 the
 rock
 of
 divine
 revelation
 and
 to
 proclaim
 the
 message
 of
 salvation
 to
 all
 nations
 kindreds
 tongues
 and
 peoples
 In
 spite
 of
 persecution
 both
 mobocratic
 and
 judicially
 sanctioned
 in
 spite
 of
 assaults
 drivings
 and
 slaughter
 the
 Church
 has
 developed
 with
 marvelous
 rapidity
 and
 strength
 since
 the
 day
 of
 its
 organization
 Joseph
 the
 prophet
 and
 his
 brother
 Hyrum
 the
 patriarch
 of
 the
 Church
 were
 brutally
 slain
 as
 martyrs
 to
 the
 truth
 at
 Carthage
 Illinois
 June
 
 
 But
 the
 Lord
 raised
 up
 others
 to
 succeed
 them
 and
 the
 world
 learned
 in
 part
 and
 yet
 shall
 know
 beyond
 all
 question
 that
 the
 Church
 so
 miraculously
 established
 in
 the
 last
 days
 is
 not
 the
 church
 of
 Joseph
 Smith
 nor
 of
 any
 other
 man
 but
 in
 literal
 verity
 the
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 The
 Lord
 has
 continued
 to
 make
 known
 His
 mind
 and
 will
 through
 prophets
 seers
 and
 revelators
 whom
 He
 has
 successively
 chosen
 and
 appointed
 to
 lead
 His
 people
 and
 the
 voice
 of
 divine
 revelation
 is
 heard
 in
 the
 Church
 today
 As
 provided
 for
 in
 its
 revealed
 plan
 and
 constitution
 the
 Church
 is
 blessed
 by
 the
 ministry
 of
 prophets
 apostles
 high
 priests
 patriarchs
 seventies
 elders
 bishops
 priests
 teachers
 and
 deacons
 The
 spiritual
 gifts
 and
 blessings
 of
 old
 are
 again
 enjoyed
 in
 rich
 abundance
 New
 scriptures
 primarily
 directed
 to
 present
 duties
 and
 current
 developments
 in
 the
 purposes
 of
 God
 yet
 which
 illuminate
 and
 make
 plain
 in
 simplicity
 the
 scriptures
 of
 old
 have
 been
 given
 to
 the
 world
 through
 the
 channel
 of
 the
 restored
 priesthood
 and
 other
 scriptures
 shall
 yet
 be
 written
 The
 united
 membership
 of
 the
 Church
 proclaims
 We
 believe
 all
 that
 God
 has
 revealed
 all
 that
 He
 does
 now
 reveal
 and
 we
 believe
 that
 He
 will
 yet
 reveal
 many
 great
 and
 important
 things
 pertaining
 to
 the
 Kingdom
 of
 God
 The
 predicted
 gathering
 of
 Israel
 from
 their
 long
 dispersion
 is
 in
 progress
 under
 the
 commission
 given
 by
 the
 Lord
 through
 Moses
 The
 mountain
 of
 the
 Lords
 house
 is
 already
 established
 in
 the
 top
 of
 the
 mountains
 and
 all
 peoples
 flow
 unto
 it
 while
 the
 elders
 of
 the
 Church
 go
 forth
 among
 the
 nations
 saying
 Come
 ye
 and
 let
 us
 go
 up
 to
 the
 mountain
 of
 the
 Lord
 to
 the
 house
 of
 the
 God
 of
 Jacob
 and
 he
 will
 teach
 us
 of
 his
 ways
 and
 we
 will
 walk
 in
 his
 paths
 for
 out
 of
 Zion
 shall
 go
 forth
 the
 law
 and
 the
 word
 of
 the
 Lord
 from
 Jerusalem
 Within
 sacred
 temples
 the
 living
 are
 officiating
 vicariously
 in
 behalf
 of
 the
 dead
 and
 the
 hearts
 of
 mortal
 children
 are
 turned
 with
 affectionate
 concern
 toward
 their
 departed
 ancestors
 while
 disembodied
 hosts
 are
 praying
 for
 the
 success
 of
 their
 posterity
 yet
 in
 the
 flesh
 in
 the
 service
 of
 salvation
 The
 saving
 gospel
 is
 offered
 freely
 to
 all
 for
 so
 hath
 its
 Author
 commanded
 Through
 the
 medium
 of
 the
 press
 and
 by
 the
 personal
 ministrations
 of
 men
 invested
 with
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 whom
 the
 Church
 sends
 out
 by
 thousands
 this
 Gospel
 of
 the
 Kingdom
 is
 today
 preached
 throughout
 the
 world
 When
 such
 witness
 among
 the
 nations
 is
 made
 complete
 then
 shall
 the
 end
 come
 and
 the
 nations
 shall
 see
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 coming
 in
 the
 clouds
 of
 heaven
 with
 power
 and
 great
 glory

 CHAPTER
 
 
 The
 Dispensation
 of
 the
 Fulness
 of
 TimesNow
 the
 thing
 to
 be
 known
 is
 what
 the
 fulness
 of
 times
 means
 or
 the
 extent
 and
 authority
 thereof
 It
 means
 this
 that
 the
 dispensation
 of
 the
 fulness
 of
 times
 is
 made
 up
 of
 all
 the
 dispensations
 that
 ever
 have
 been
 given
 since
 the
 world
 began
 until
 this
 time
 Unto
 Adam
 first
 was
 given
 a
 dispensation
 It
 is
 well
 known
 that
 God
 spake
 to
 him
 with
 His
 own
 voice
 in
 the
 garden
 and
 gave
 him
 the
 promise
 of
 the
 Messiah
 And
 unto
 Noah
 also
 was
 a
 dispensation
 given
 for
 Jesus
 said
 As
 it
 was
 in
 the
 days
 of
 Noah
 so
 shall
 it
 be
 also
 in
 the
 days
 of
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 and
 as
 the
 righteous
 were
 saved
 then
 and
 the
 wicked
 destroyed
 so
 it
 will
 be
 now
 And
 from
 Noah
 to
 Abraham
 and
 from
 Abraham
 to
 Moses
 and
 from
 Moses
 to
 Elias
 and
 from
 Elias
 to
 John
 the
 Baptist
 and
 from
 then
 to
 Jesus
 Christ
 and
 from
 Jesus
 Christ
 to
 Peter
 James
 and
 John
 the
 Apostles
 all
 having
 received
 in
 their
 dispensation
 by
 revelation
 from
 God
 to
 accomplish
 the
 great
 scheme
 of
 restitution
 spoken
 by
 all
 the
 holy
 Prophets
 since
 the
 world
 began

 which
 is
 the
 dispensation

 Limitations
 of
 the
 Aaronic
 PriesthoodAfter
 conferring
 the
 Lesser
 or
 Aaronic
 Priesthood
 upon
 Joseph
 Smith
 and
 Oliver
 Cowdery
 the
 officiating
 angel
 who
 had
 been
 known
 while
 a
 mortal
 being
 as
 John
 the
 Baptist
 explained
 that
 the
 authority
 he
 had
 imparted
 did
 not
 extend
 to
 the
 layingon
 of
 hands
 for
 the
 bestowal
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 the
 latter
 ordinance
 being
 a
 function
 of
 the
 Higher
 or
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 Consider
 the
 instance
 of
 Philip
 not
 the
 apostle
 Philip
 whose
 ordination
 empowered
 him
 to
 baptize
 though
 a
 higher
 authority
 than
 his
 was
 requisite
 for
 the
 conferring
 of
 the
 Holy
 Ghost
 and
 consequently
 the
 apostles
 Peter
 and
 John
 went
 down
 to
 Samaria
 to
 officiate

 Priesthood
 and
 Office
 ThereinIt
 is
 important
 to
 know
 that
 although
 Joseph
 Smith
 and
 Oliver
 Cowdery
 had
 been
 ordained
 to
 the
 Holy
 Apostleship
 and
 therefore
 to
 a
 fulness
 of
 the
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 by
 Peter
 James
 and
 John
 it
 was
 necessary
 that
 they
 be
 ordained
 as
 elders
 in
 the
 Church
 When
 they
 received
 the
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 from
 the
 three
 ancient
 apostles
 there
 was
 no
 organized
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 and
 consequently
 no
 need
 of
 Church
 officers
 such
 as
 elders
 priests
 teachers
 or
 deacons
 As
 soon
 as
 the
 Church
 was
 established
 officers
 were
 chosen
 therein
 and
 these
 were
 ordained
 to
 the
 requisite
 office
 or
 grade
 in
 the
 Priesthood
 Moreover
 the
 principle
 of
 common
 consent
 in
 the
 conduct
 of
 Church
 affairs
 was
 observed
 in
 this
 early
 action
 of
 the
 members
 in
 voting
 to
 sustain
 the
 men
 nominated
 for
 official
 positions
 and
 has
 continued
 to
 be
 the
 rule
 of
 the
 Church
 to
 this
 day
 It
 is
 pertinent
 to
 point
 out
 further
 that
 in
 conferring
 upon
 Joseph
 and
 Oliver
 the
 Aaronic
 Priesthood
 John
 the
 Baptist
 did
 not
 ordain
 them
 to
 the
 office
 of
 priest
 teacher
 or
 deacon
 These
 three
 offices
 are
 included
 in
 the
 Aaronic
 as
 are
 the
 offices
 of

 seventy

 priest

 the

 Priesthood

 Lords
 gracious
 promise
 given
 in

 Kirtland
 Templeto
 appear
 unto
 His
 servants
 at
 times
 then
 future
 and
 to
 speak
 unto
 them
 with
 His
 own
 voice
 provided
 the
 people
 would
 keep
 His
 commandments
 and
 not
 pollute
 that
 holy
 househas
 been
 in
 no
 wise
 abrogated
 nor
 forfeited
 through
 the
 enforced
 relinquishment
 of
 the
 Kirtland
 Temple
 by
 the
 Latterday
 Saints
 The
 people
 were
 compelled
 to
 flee
 before
 the
 fury
 of
 mobocratic
 persecution
 but
 they
 hastened
 to
 erect
 another
 and
 yet
 more
 splendid
 sanctuary
 at
 Nauvoo
 Illinois
 and
 were
 again
 dispossessed
 by
 lawless
 mobs
 In
 the
 valleys
 of
 Utah
 the
 Church
 has
 erected
 four
 great
 temples
 each
 more
 stately
 than
 the
 last
 and
 in
 these
 holy
 houses
 the
 sacred
 ordinances
 pertaining
 to
 salvation
 and
 exaltation
 of
 both
 the
 living
 and
 the
 dead
 are
 in
 uninterrupted
 progress
 The
 temples

 Consistency
 of
 the
 Churchs
 Claim
 to
 AuthorityThe
 proofs
 of
 order
 and
 system
 in
 the
 restoration
 of
 authority
 to
 officiate
 in
 particular
 functions
 pertaining
 to
 the
 priesthood
 are
 striking
 and
 go
 to
 prove
 the
 continued
 validity
 beyond
 the
 grave
 of
 authoritative
 ordination
 on
 earth
 The
 keys
 of
 the
 Aaronic
 order
 comprizing
 authority
 to
 baptize
 for
 the
 remission
 of
 sins
 were
 brought
 by
 John
 the
 Baptist
 who
 had
 been
 especially
 commissioned
 in
 that
 order
 of
 priesthood
 in
 the
 time
 of
 Christ
 The
 apostleship
 comprizing
 all
 powers
 inherent
 in
 the
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 was
 restored
 by
 the
 presiding
 apostles
 of
 old
 Peter
 James
 and
 John
 Then
 as
 has
 been
 seen
 Moses
 conferred
 the
 authority
 to
 prosecute
 the
 work
 of
 gathering
 and
 Elijah
 who
 not
 having
 tasted
 death
 held
 a
 peculiar
 relation
 to
 both
 the
 living
 and
 the
 dead
 delivered
 the
 authority
 of
 vicarious
 ministry
 for
 the
 departed
 To
 these
 appointments
 by
 heavenly
 authority
 should
 be
 added
 that
 given
 by
 Elias
 who
 appeared
 to
 Joseph
 Smith
 and
 Oliver
 Cowdery
 and
 committed
 the
 dispensation
 of
 the
 gospel
 of
 Abraham
 It
 is
 evident
 then
 that
 the
 claims
 made
 by
 the
 Church
 with
 respect
 to
 its
 authority
 are
 complete
 and
 consistent
 as
 to
 the
 source
 of
 the
 powers
 professed
 and
 the
 channels
 through
 which
 such
 have
 been
 delivered
 again
 to
 earth
 Scripture
 and
 revelation
 both
 ancient
 and
 modern
 support
 as
 an
 unalterable
 law
 the
 principle
 that
 no
 one
 can
 delegate
 to
 another
 an
 authority
 which
 the
 giver
 does
 not
 possess
 
 Cessation
 of
 the
 Melchizedek
 Administration
 in
 Ancient
 TimesThe
 Higher
 or
 Melchizedek
 Priesthood
 was
 held
 by
 the
 patriarchs
 from
 Adam
 to
 Moses
 Aaron
 was
 ordained
 to
 the
 priests
 office
 as
 were
 his
 sons
 but
 that
 Moses
 held
 superior
 authority
 is
 abundantly
 shown
 Numb
 
 After
 Aarons
 death
 his
 son
 Eleazar
 officiated
 in
 the
 authority
 of
 the
 Lesser
 Priesthood
 and
 even
 Joshua
 had
 to
 take
 counsel
 and
 authority
 from
 him
 Numb
 
 From
 the
 ministry
 of
 Moses
 to
 that
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 the
 Lesser
 Priesthood
 alone
 was
 operative
 upon
 the
 earth
 excepting
 only
 the
 instances
 of
 specially
 delegated
 authority
 of
 the
 higher
 order
 such
 as
 is
 manifest
 in
 the
 ministrations
 of
 certain
 chosen
 prophets
 Isaiah
 Jeremiah
 Ezekiel
 and
 others
 It
 is
 evident
 that
 these
 prophets
 seers
 and
 revelators
 were
 individually
 and
 specially
 commissioned
 but
 it
 appears
 that
 they
 had
 not
 authority
 to
 call
 and
 ordain
 successors
 for
 in
 their
 time
 the
 Higher
 Priesthood
 was
 not
 existent
 on
 earth
 in
 an
 organized
 state
 with
 duly
 officered
 quorums
 Not
 so
 with
 the
 Aaronic
 and
 Levitical
 Priesthood
 however
 The
 matter
 is
 made
 particularly
 plain
 through
 latterday
 revelation

 CHAPTER
 
 JESUS
 THE
 CHRIST
 TO
 RETURN
 THE
 LORDS
 SECOND
 ADVENT
 PREDICTED
 IN
 ANCIENT
 SCRIPTURE
 Ye
 men
 of
 Galilee
 why
 stand
 ye
 gazing
 up
 into
 heaven
 this
 same
 Jesus
 which
 is
 taken
 up
 from
 you
 into
 heaven
 shall
 so
 come
 in
 like
 manner
 as
 ye
 have
 seen
 him
 go
 into
 heaven
 So
 spake
 the
 whiterobed
 angels
 to
 the
 eleven
 apostles
 as
 the
 resurrected
 Christ
 ascended
 from
 their
 midst
 on
 Olivet
 The
 scriptures
 abound
 in
 predictions
 of
 the
 Lords
 return
 By
 the
 second
 advent
 we
 understand
 not
 the
 personal
 appearing
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 God
 to
 a
 few
 such
 as
 His
 visitation
 to
 Saul
 of
 Tarsus
 to
 Joseph
 Smith
 in
 
 and
 again
 in
 the
 Kirtland
 Temple
 in
 
 nor
 later
 manifestations
 to
 His
 worthy
 servants
 as
 specifically
 promised
 but
 His
 yet
 future
 coming
 in
 power
 and
 great
 glory
 accompanied
 by
 hosts
 of
 resurrected
 and
 glorified
 beings
 to
 execute
 judgment
 upon
 the
 earth
 and
 to
 inaugurate
 a
 reign
 of
 righteousness
 The
 prophets
 of
 both
 hemispheres
 who
 lived
 prior
 to
 the
 meridian
 of
 time
 said
 comparatively
 little
 concerning
 the
 Lords
 second
 coming
 their
 souls
 were
 too
 full
 of
 the
 merciful
 plan
 of
 redemption
 associated
 with
 the
 Saviors
 birth
 into
 mortality
 to
 permit
 them
 to
 dwell
 upon
 the
 yet
 more
 distant
 consummation
 appointed
 for
 the
 last
 days
 Certain
 of
 them
 however
 were
 permitted
 to
 behold
 in
 vision
 the
 working
 out
 of
 the
 divine
 purposes
 even
 to
 the
 end
 of
 time
 and
 these
 testified
 with
 unsurpassed
 fervency
 concerning
 the
 glorious
 coming
 of
 Christ
 in
 the
 final
 dispensation
 Enoch
 the
 seventh
 from
 Adam
 prophesied
 saying
 Behold
 the
 Lord
 cometh
 with
 ten
 thousands
 of
 his
 saints
 to
 execute
 judgment
 upon
 all
 In
 a
 more
 extended
 account
 of
 the
 Lords
 revelations
 to
 Enoch
 than
 is
 included
 in
 the
 Bible
 we
 read
 that
 after
 this
 righteous
 prophet
 had
 been
 shown
 the
 scenes
 of
 Israels
 history
 down
 to
 and
 beyond
 the
 death
 resurrection
 and
 ascension
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 he
 pleaded
 with
 God
 saying
 I
 ask
 thee
 if
 thou
 wilt
 not
 come
 again
 on
 the
 earth
 And
 the
 Lord
 said
 unto
 Enoch
 As
 I
 live
 even
 so
 will
 I
 come
 in
 the
 last
 days
 in
 the
 days
 of
 wickedness
 and
 vengeance
 to
 fulfil
 the
 oath
 which
 I
 have
 made
 unto
 you
 concerning
 the
 children
 of
 Noah
 And
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 that
 Enoch
 saw
 the
 day
 of
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 in
 the
 last
 days
 to
 dwell
 on
 the
 earth
 in
 righteousness
 for
 the
 space
 of
 a
 thousand
 years
 Isaiah
 in
 rapturous
 contemplation
 of
 the
 eventual
 triumph
 of
 righteousness
 exclaimed
 Say
 to
 them
 that
 are
 of
 a
 fearful
 heart
 Be
 strong
 fear
 not
 behold
 your
 God
 will
 come
 with
 vengeance
 even
 God
 with
 a
 recompence
 he
 will
 come
 and
 save
 you
 and
 again
 Behold
 the
 Lord
 God
 will
 come
 with
 strong
 hand
 and
 his
 arm
 shall
 rule
 for
 him
 behold
 his
 reward
 is
 with
 him
 and
 his
 work
 before
 him
 The
 conditions
 specified
 were
 not
 realized
 in
 the
 earthly
 life
 of
 the
 Redeemer
 moreover
 the
 context
 clearly
 shows
 that
 the
 prophets
 words
 are
 applicable
 to
 the
 last
 days
 onlythe
 time
 of
 the
 ransomed
 of
 the
 Lord
 the
 time
 of
 restitution
 and
 of
 the
 triumph
 of
 Zion
 Of
 all
 Biblical
 scriptures
 relating
 to
 our
 subject
 the
 utterances
 of
 the
 Christ
 Himself
 in
 the
 course
 of
 His
 earthly
 ministry
 are
 most
 direct
 and
 certain
 Many
 of
 these
 we
 have
 already
 considered
 in
 the
 narrative
 of
 the
 Saviors
 life
 the
 few
 following
 are
 sufficient
 for
 present
 demonstration
 For
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 shall
 come
 in
 the
 glory
 of
 his
 Father
 with
 his
 angels
 and
 then
 he
 shall
 reward
 every
 man
 according
 to
 his
 works
 To
 the
 apostles
 and
 the
 people
 generally
 He
 proclaimed
 Whosoever
 therefore
 shall
 be
 ashamed
 of
 me
 and
 of
 my
 words
 in
 this
 adulterous
 and
 sinful
 generation
 of
 him
 also
 shall
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 be
 ashamed
 when
 he
 cometh
 in
 the
 glory
 of
 his
 Father
 with
 the
 holy
 angels
 When
 a
 bound
 prisoner
 before
 proud
 Caiaphas
 Jesus
 answered
 the
 unlawful
 adjuration
 of
 the
 corrupt
 high
 priest
 by
 affirming
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 Hereafter
 shall
 ye
 see
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 sitting
 on
 the
 right
 hand
 of
 power
 and
 coming
 in
 the
 clouds
 of
 heaven
 The
 apostles
 had
 been
 so
 impressed
 with
 the
 Masters
 assurance
 that
 He
 would
 return
 to
 earth
 in
 power
 and
 glory
 that
 they
 eagerly
 questioned
 as
 to
 the
 time
 and
 signs
 of
 His
 coming
 He
 stated
 explicitly
 though
 at
 the
 time
 they
 failed
 to
 comprehend
 Him
 that
 many
 great
 events
 would
 intervene
 between
 His
 departure
 and
 return
 including
 the
 long
 era
 of
 darkness
 associated
 with
 the
 apostasy
 But
 as
 to
 the
 certainty
 of
 His
 advent
 in
 glory
 as
 Judge
 and
 Lord
 and
 King
 Jesus
 left
 no
 excuse
 for
 dubiety
 in
 the
 minds
 of
 His
 apostles
 After
 the
 ascension
 throughout
 the
 course
 of
 apostolic
 administration
 the
 future
 coming
 of
 the
 Lord
 was
 preached
 with
 earnest
 emphasis
 Book
 of
 Mormon
 prophecies
 concerning
 the
 advent
 of
 the
 Lord
 in
 the
 last
 days
 are
 specific
 and
 definite
 On
 the
 occasion
 of
 His
 appearing
 to
 the
 Nephites
 on
 the
 American
 continent
 shortly
 after
 His
 ascension
 from
 the
 Mount
 of
 Olives
 Christ
 preached
 the
 gospel
 to
 assembled
 multitudes
 And
 he
 did
 expound
 all
 things
 even
 from
 the
 beginning
 until
 the
 time
 that
 he
 should
 come
 in
 his
 glory
 and
 the
 events
 to
 follow
 even
 unto
 the
 great
 and
 last
 day
 In
 granting
 the
 wish
 of
 the
 three
 Nephite
 disciples
 who
 desired
 to
 continue
 their
 ministry
 in
 the
 flesh
 throughout
 the
 generations
 to
 come
 the
 Lord
 said
 unto
 them
 Ye
 shall
 live
 to
 behold
 all
 the
 doings
 of
 the
 Father
 unto
 the
 children
 of
 men
 even
 until
 all
 things
 shall
 be
 fulfilled
 according
 to
 the
 will
 of
 the
 Father
 when
 I
 shall
 come
 in
 my
 glory
 with
 the
 powers
 of
 heaven
 And
 ye
 shall
 never
 endure
 the
 pains
 of
 death
 but
 when
 I
 shall
 come
 in
 my
 glory
 ye
 shall
 be
 changed
 in
 the
 twinkling
 of
 an
 eye
 from
 mortality
 to
 immortality
 and
 then
 shall
 ye
 be
 blessed
 in
 the
 kingdom
 of
 my
 Father
 THE
 COMING
 OF
 THE
 LORD
 PROCLAIMED
 THROUGH
 MODERN
 REVELATION
 To
 the
 Church
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 restored
 and
 reestablished
 in
 these
 the
 last
 days
 the
 word
 of
 the
 Lord
 has
 come
 repeatedly
 declaring
 the
 actuality
 of
 His
 second
 advent
 and
 the
 nearness
 of
 that
 glorious
 yet
 dreadful
 event
 But
 a
 few
 months
 after
 the
 Church
 was
 organized
 the
 voice
 of
 Jesus
 Christ
 was
 heard
 admonishing
 the
 elders
 to
 vigilance
 and
 proclaiming
 as
 follows
 For
 the
 hour
 is
 nigh
 and
 the
 day
 soon
 at
 hand
 when
 the
 earth
 is
 ripe
 and
 all
 the
 proud
 and
 they
 that
 do
 wickedly
 shall
 be
 as
 stubble
 and
 I
 will
 burn
 them
 up
 saith
 the
 Lord
 of
 Hosts
 that
 wickedness
 shall
 not
 be
 upon
 the
 earth
 for
 the
 hour
 is
 nigh
 and
 that
 which
 was
 spoken
 by
 mine
 apostles
 must
 be
 fulfilled
 for
 as
 they
 spoke
 so
 shall
 it
 come
 to
 pass
 for
 I
 will
 reveal
 myself
 from
 heaven
 with
 power
 and
 great
 glory
 with
 all
 the
 hosts
 thereof
 and
 dwell
 in
 righteousness
 with
 men
 on
 earth
 a
 thousand
 years
 and
 the
 wicked
 shall
 not
 stand
 In
 the
 month
 following
 the
 Lord
 gave
 instructions
 to
 certain
 elders
 concluding
 with
 these
 portentous
 words
 Wherefore
 be
 faithful
 praying
 always
 having
 your
 lamps
 trimmed
 and
 burning
 and
 oil
 with
 you
 that
 you
 may
 be
 ready
 at
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Bridegroom
 for
 behold
 verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 that
 I
 come
 quickly
 Even
 so
 Amen
 Again
 we
 read
 in
 a
 later
 revelation
 And
 blessed
 are
 you
 because
 you
 have
 believed
 and
 more
 blessed
 are
 you
 because
 you
 are
 called
 of
 me
 to
 preach
 my
 gospel
 to
 lift
 up
 your
 voice
 as
 with
 the
 sound
 of
 a
 trump
 both
 long
 and
 loud
 and
 cry
 repentance
 unto
 a
 crooked
 and
 perverse
 generation
 preparing
 the
 way
 of
 the
 Lord
 for
 his
 second
 coming
 for
 behold
 verily
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 the
 time
 is
 soon
 at
 hand
 that
 I
 shall
 come
 in
 a
 cloud
 with
 power
 and
 great
 glory
 and
 it
 shall
 be
 a
 great
 day
 at
 the
 time
 of
 my
 coming
 for
 all
 nations
 shall
 tremble
 The
 Lord
 Jesus
 addressed
 a
 general
 revelation
 to
 His
 Church
 in
 March
 
 through
 which
 His
 earlier
 predictions
 uttered
 to
 the
 Twelve
 shortly
 before
 His
 betrayal
 were
 made
 plain
 and
 the
 assurances
 of
 His
 glorious
 coming
 were
 thus
 reiterated
 Ye
 look
 and
 behold
 the
 figtrees
 and
 ye
 see
 them
 with
 your
 eyes
 and
 ye
 say
 when
 they
 begin
 to
 shoot
 forth
 and
 their
 leaves
 are
 yet
 tender
 that
 summer
 is
 now
 nigh
 at
 hand
 even
 so
 it
 shall
 be
 in
 that
 day
 when
 they
 shall
 see
 all
 these
 things
 then
 shall
 they
 know
 that
 the
 hour
 is
 nigh
 And
 it
 shall
 come
 to
 pass
 that
 he
 that
 feareth
 me
 shall
 be
 looking
 forth
 for
 the
 great
 day
 of
 the
 Lord
 to
 come
 even
 for
 the
 signs
 of
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 And
 they
 shall
 see
 signs
 and
 wonders
 for
 they
 shall
 be
 shown
 forth
 in
 the
 heavens
 above
 and
 in
 the
 earth
 beneath
 and
 they
 shall
 behold
 blood
 and
 fire
 and
 vapors
 of
 smoke
 and
 before
 the
 day
 of
 the
 Lord
 shall
 come
 the
 sun
 shall
 be
 darkened
 and
 the
 moon
 be
 turned
 into
 blood
 and
 stars
 fall
 from
 heaven
 and
 the
 remnant
 shall
 be
 gathered
 unto
 this
 place
 and
 then
 they
 shall
 look
 for
 me
 and
 behold
 I
 will
 come
 and
 they
 shall
 see
 me
 in
 the
 clouds
 of
 heaven
 clothed
 with
 power
 and
 great
 glory
 with
 all
 the
 holy
 angels
 and
 he
 that
 watches
 not
 for
 me
 shall
 be
 cut
 off
 So
 near
 is
 the
 consummation
 that
 the
 intervening
 period
 is
 called
 today
 and
 in
 applying
 this
 time
 designation
 in
 the
 year
 
 the
 Lord
 said
 Behold
 now
 it
 is
 called
 today
 until
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 man
 and
 verily
 it
 is
 a
 day
 of
 sacrifice
 and
 a
 day
 for
 the
 tithing
 of
 my
 people
 for
 he
 that
 is
 tithed
 shall
 not
 be
 burned
 at
 his
 coming
 For
 after
 today
 cometh
 the
 burning
 this
 is
 speaking
 after
 the
 manner
 of
 the
 Lord
 for
 verily
 I
 say
 tomorrow
 all
 the
 proud
 and
 they
 that
 do
 wickedly
 shall
 be
 as
 stubble
 and
 I
 will
 burn
 them
 up
 for
 I
 am
 the
 Lord
 of
 hosts
 and
 I
 will
 not
 spare
 any
 that
 remain
 in
 Babylon
 Wherefore
 if
 ye
 believe
 me
 ye
 will
 labor
 while
 it
 is
 called
 today
 THE
 TIME
 AND
 ACCOMPANIMENTS
 OF
 THE
 LORDS
 COMING
 The
 date
 of
 the
 future
 advent
 of
 Christ
 has
 never
 been
 revealed
 to
 man
 To
 the
 inquiring
 apostles
 who
 labored
 with
 the
 Master
 He
 said
 But
 of
 that
 day
 and
 hour
 knoweth
 no
 man
 no
 not
 the
 angels
 of
 heaven
 but
 my
 Father
 only
 In
 the
 present
 age
 a
 similar
 declaration
 has
 been
 made
 by
 the
 Father
 I
 the
 Lord
 God
 have
 spoken
 it
 but
 the
 hour
 and
 the
 day
 no
 man
 knoweth
 neither
 the
 angels
 in
 heaven
 nor
 shall
 they
 know
 until
 he
 comes
 Only
 through
 watchfulness
 and
 prayer
 may
 the
 signs
 of
 the
 times
 be
 correctly
 interpreted
 and
 the
 imminence
 of
 the
 Lords
 appearing
 be
 apprehended
 To
 the
 unwatchful
 and
 the
 wicked
 the
 event
 will
 be
 as
 sudden
 and
 unexpected
 as
 the
 coming
 of
 a
 thief
 in
 the
 night
 But
 we
 are
 not
 left
 without
 definite
 information
 as
 to
 precedent
 signs
 Biblical
 prophecies
 bearing
 upon
 this
 subject
 we
 have
 heretofore
 considered
 As
 later
 scriptures
 affirm
 Before
 the
 great
 day
 of
 the
 Lord
 shall
 come
 Jacob
 shall
 flourish
 in
 the
 wilderness
 and
 the
 Lamanites
 shall
 blossom
 as
 the
 rose
 Zion
 shall
 flourish
 upon
 the
 hills
 and
 rejoice
 upon
 the
 mountains
 and
 shall
 be
 assembled
 together
 unto
 the
 place
 which
 I
 have
 appointed
 War
 shall
 become
 so
 general
 that
 every
 man
 who
 will
 not
 take
 arms
 against
 his
 neighbor
 must
 of
 necessity
 flee
 to
 the
 land
 of
 Zion
 for
 safety
 Ephraim
 shall
 assemble
 in
 Zion
 on
 the
 western
 continent
 and
 Judah
 shall
 be
 again
 established
 in
 the
 east
 and
 the
 cities
 of
 Zion
 and
 Jerusalem
 shall
 be
 the
 capitals
 of
 the
 world
 empire
 over
 which
 Messiah
 shall
 reign
 in
 undisputed
 authority
 The
 Lost
 Tribes
 shall
 be
 brought
 forth
 from
 the
 place
 where
 God
 has
 hidden
 them
 through
 the
 centuries
 and
 receive
 their
 long
 deferred
 blessings
 at
 the
 hands
 of
 Ephraim
 The
 people
 of
 Israel
 shall
 be
 restored
 from
 their
 scattered
 condition
 In
 addressing
 the
 elders
 of
 His
 Church
 in
 
 the
 Lord
 urged
 upon
 them
 the
 imperative
 need
 of
 devoted
 diligence
 and
 said
 Abide
 ye
 in
 the
 liberty
 wherewith
 ye
 are
 made
 free
 entangle
 not
 yourselves
 in
 sin
 but
 let
 your
 hands
 be
 clean
 until
 the
 Lord
 come
 For
 not
 many
 days
 hence
 and
 the
 earth
 shall
 tremble
 and
 reel
 to
 and
 fro
 as
 a
 drunken
 man
 and
 the
 sun
 shall
 hide
 his
 face
 and
 shall
 refuse
 to
 give
 light
 and
 the
 moon
 shall
 be
 bathed
 in
 blood
 and
 the
 stars
 shall
 become
 exceeding
 angry
 and
 shall
 cast
 themselves
 down
 as
 a
 fig
 that
 falleth
 from
 off
 a
 fig
 tree
 And
 after
 your
 testimony
 cometh
 wrath
 and
 indignation
 upon
 the
 people
 For
 after
 your
 testimony
 cometh
 the
 testimony
 of
 earthquakes
 that
 shall
 cause
 groanings
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 her
 and
 men
 shall
 fall
 upon
 the
 ground
 and
 shall
 not
 be
 able
 to
 stand
 And
 also
 cometh
 the
 testimony
 of
 the
 voice
 of
 thunderings
 and
 the
 voice
 of
 lightnings
 and
 the
 voice
 of
 tempests
 and
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 waves
 of
 the
 sea
 heaving
 themselves
 beyond
 their
 bounds
 And
 all
 things
 shall
 be
 in
 commotion
 and
 surely
 mens
 hearts
 shall
 fail
 them
 for
 fear
 shall
 come
 upon
 all
 people
 And
 angels
 shall
 fly
 through
 the
 midst
 of
 heaven
 crying
 with
 a
 loud
 voice
 sounding
 the
 trump
 of
 God
 saying
 Prepare
 ye
 prepare
 ye
 O
 inhabitants
 of
 the
 earth
 for
 the
 judgment
 of
 our
 God
 is
 come
 behold
 and
 lo
 the
 Bridegroom
 cometh
 go
 ye
 out
 to
 meet
 him
 A
 characteristic
 of
 presentday
 revelation
 is
 the
 reiteration
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 event
 is
 nigh
 at
 hand
 even
 at
 the
 doors
 The
 fateful
 time
 is
 repeatedly
 designated
 in
 scripture
 the
 great
 and
 dreadful
 day
 of
 the
 Lord
 Fearful
 indeed
 will
 it
 be
 to
 individuals
 families
 and
 nations
 who
 have
 so
 far
 sunk
 into
 sin
 as
 to
 have
 forfeited
 their
 claim
 to
 mercy
 The
 time
 is
 not
 that
 of
 the
 final
 judgmentwhen
 the
 whole
 race
 of
 mankind
 shall
 stand
 in
 the
 resurrected
 state
 before
 the
 bar
 of
 Godnevertheless
 it
 shall
 be
 a
 time
 of
 unprecedented
 blessing
 unto
 the
 righteous
 and
 of
 condemnation
 and
 vengeance
 upon
 the
 wicked
 With
 Christ
 shall
 come
 those
 who
 have
 already
 been
 resurrected
 and
 His
 approach
 shall
 be
 the
 means
 of
 inaugurating
 a
 general
 resurrection
 of
 the
 righteous
 dead
 while
 the
 pure
 and
 just
 who
 are
 still
 in
 the
 flesh
 shall
 be
 instantaneously
 changed
 from
 the
 mortal
 to
 the
 immortal
 state
 and
 shall
 be
 caught
 up
 with
 the
 newly
 resurrected
 to
 meet
 the
 Lord
 and
 His
 celestial
 company
 and
 shall
 descend
 with
 Him
 To
 this
 effect
 did
 Paul
 prophesy
 Even
 so
 them
 also
 which
 sleep
 in
 Jesus
 will
 God
 bring
 with
 him
 For
 the
 Lord
 himself
 shall
 descend
 from
 heaven
 with
 a
 shout
 with
 the
 voice
 of
 the
 archangel
 and
 with
 the
 trump
 of
 God
 and
 the
 dead
 in
 Christ
 shall
 rise
 first
 Then
 we
 which
 are
 alive
 and
 remain
 shall
 be
 caught
 up
 together
 with
 them
 in
 the
 clouds
 to
 meet
 the
 Lord
 in
 the
 air
 Compare
 the
 promise
 made
 to
 the
 Three
 Nephites
 And
 ye
 shall
 never
 endure
 the
 pains
 of
 death
 but
 when
 I
 shall
 come
 in
 my
 glory
 ye
 shall
 be
 changed
 in
 the
 twinkling
 of
 an
 eye
 from
 mortality
 to
 immortality
 Of
 the
 superlative
 glories
 awaiting
 the
 righteous
 when
 the
 Lord
 shall
 come
 we
 have
 received
 in
 this
 day
 a
 partial
 description
 as
 follows
 And
 the
 face
 of
 the
 Lord
 shall
 be
 unveiled
 and
 the
 saints
 that
 are
 upon
 the
 earth
 who
 are
 alive
 shall
 be
 quickened
 and
 be
 caught
 up
 to
 meet
 him
 The
 heathen
 nations
 shall
 be
 redeemed
 and
 have
 part
 in
 the
 first
 resurrection
 THE
 KINGDOM
 OF
 HEAVEN
 TO
 COME
 The
 coming
 of
 Christ
 in
 the
 last
 days
 accompanied
 by
 the
 apostles
 of
 old
 and
 by
 the
 resurrected
 saints
 is
 to
 mark
 the
 establishment
 of
 the
 Kingdom
 of
 Heaven
 upon
 earth
 The
 faithful
 apostles
 who
 were
 with
 Jesus
 in
 His
 earthly
 ministry
 are
 to
 be
 enthroned
 as
 judges
 of
 the
 whole
 house
 of
 Israel
 they
 will
 judge
 the
 Nephite
 Twelve
 who
 in
 turn
 will
 be
 empowered
 to
 judge
 the
 descendants
 of
 Lehi
 or
 that
 branch
 of
 the
 Israelitish
 nation
 which
 was
 established
 upon
 the
 western
 continent
 While
 the
 expressions
 Kingdom
 of
 God
 and
 Kingdom
 of
 Heaven
 are
 used
 in
 the
 Bible
 synonymously
 or
 interchangeably
 later
 revelation
 gives
 to
 each
 a
 distinctive
 meaning
 The
 Kingdom
 of
 God
 is
 the
 Church
 established
 by
 divine
 authority
 upon
 the
 earth
 this
 institution
 asserts
 no
 claim
 to
 temporal
 rule
 over
 nations
 its
 sceptre
 of
 power
 is
 that
 of
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 to
 be
 used
 in
 the
 preaching
 of
 the
 gospel
 and
 in
 administering
 its
 ordinances
 for
 the
 salvation
 of
 mankind
 living
 and
 dead
 The
 Kingdom
 of
 Heaven
 is
 the
 divinely
 ordained
 system
 of
 government
 and
 dominion
 in
 all
 matters
 temporal
 and
 spiritual
 this
 will
 be
 established
 on
 earth
 only
 when
 its
 rightful
 Head
 the
 King
 of
 kings
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 comes
 to
 reign
 His
 administration
 will
 be
 one
 of
 order
 operated
 through
 the
 agency
 of
 His
 commissioned
 representatives
 invested
 with
 the
 Holy
 Priesthood
 When
 Christ
 appears
 in
 His
 glory
 and
 not
 before
 will
 be
 realized
 a
 complete
 fulfilment
 of
 the

 The
 Kingdom
 of
 God
 has

 among

 prepare
 them

 the
 Kingdom
 of
 Heaven
 which

 THE
 MILLENNIUM
 The
 inauguration
 of
 Christs
 reign
 on
 earth
 is
 to
 be
 the
 beginning
 of
 a
 period
 that
 shall
 be
 distinct
 in
 many
 important
 particulars
 from
 all
 precedent
 and
 subsequent
 time
 and
 the
 Lord
 shall
 reign
 with
 His
 people
 a
 thousand
 years
 The
 government
 of
 individuals
 communities
 and
 nations
 throughout
 this
 Millennium
 is
 to
 be
 that
 of
 a
 perfect
 theocracy
 with
 Jesus
 the
 Christ
 as
 Lord
 and
 King
 The
 more
 wicked
 part
 of
 the
 race
 shall
 have
 been
 destroyed
 and
 during
 the
 period
 Satan
 shall
 be
 bound
 that
 he
 should
 deceive
 the
 nations
 no
 more
 till
 the
 thousand
 years
 should
 be
 fulfilled
 while
 the
 just
 shall
 share
 with
 Christ
 in
 rightful
 rule
 and
 dominion
 The
 righteous
 dead
 shall
 have
 come
 forth
 from
 their
 graves
 while
 the
 wicked
 shall
 remain
 unresurrected
 until
 the
 thousand
 years
 be
 past
 Men
 yet
 in
 the
 flesh
 shall
 mingle
 with
 immortalized
 beings
 children
 shall
 grow
 to
 maturity
 and
 then
 die
 in
 peace
 or
 be
 changed
 to
 immortality
 in
 the
 twinkling
 of
 an
 eye
 There
 shall
 be
 surcease
 of
 enmity
 between
 man
 and
 beast
 the
 venom
 of
 serpents
 and
 the
 ferocity
 of
 the
 brute
 creation
 shall
 be
 done
 away
 and
 love
 shall
 be
 the
 dominant
 power
 of
 control
 Among
 the
 earliest
 revelations
 on
 the
 subject
 is
 that
 given
 to
 Enoch
 and
 in
 this
 the
 return
 of
 that
 prophet
 and
 his
 righteous
 people
 with
 Christ
 in
 the
 last
 days
 was
 thus
 assured
 And
 the
 Lord
 said
 unto
 Enoch
 Then
 shalt
 thou
 and
 all
 thy
 city
 meet
 them
 there
 and
 we
 will
 receive
 them
 into
 our
 bosom
 and
 they
 shall
 see
 us
 and
 we
 will
 fall
 upon
 their
 necks
 and
 they
 shall
 fall
 upon
 our
 necks
 and
 we
 will
 kiss
 each
 other
 And
 there
 shall
 be
 mine
 abode
 and
 it
 shall
 be
 Zion
 which
 shall
 come
 forth
 out
 of
 all
 the
 creations
 which
 I
 have
 made
 and
 for
 the
 space
 of
 a
 thousand
 years
 the
 earth
 shall
 rest
 And
 it
 came
 to
 pass
 that
 Enoch
 saw
 the
 day
 of
 the
 coming
 of
 the
 Son
 of
 Man
 in
 the
 last
 days
 to
 dwell
 on
 the
 earth
 in
 righteousness
 for
 the
 space
 of
 a
 thousand
 years
 In
 these
 latter
 days
 the
 Lord
 has
 thus
 spoken
 requiring
 preparation
 for
 the
 Millennial
 era
 and
 describing
 in
 part
 the
 glories
 thereof
 And
 prepare
 for
 the
 revelation
 which
 is
 to
 come
 when
 the
 veil
 of
 the
 covering
 of
 my
 temple
 in
 my
 tabernacle
 which
 hideth
 the
 earth
 shall
 be
 taken
 off
 and
 all
 flesh
 shall
 see
 me
 together
 And
 every
 corruptible
 thing
 both
 of
 man
 or
 of
 the
 beasts
 of
 the
 field
 or
 of
 the
 fowls
 of
 the
 heavens
 or
 of
 the
 fish
 of
 the
 sea
 that
 dwell
 upon
 all
 the
 face
 of
 the
 earth
 shall
 be
 consumed
 And
 also
 that
 of
 element
 shall
 melt
 with
 fervent
 heat
 and
 all
 things
 shall
 become
 new
 that
 my
 knowledge
 and
 glory
 may
 dwell
 upon
 all
 the
 earth
 And
 in
 that
 day
 the
 enmity
 of
 man
 and
 the
 enmity
 of
 beasts
 yea
 the
 enmity
 of
 all
 flesh
 shall
 cease
 from
 before
 my
 face
 And
 in
 that
 day
 whatsoever
 any
 man
 shall
 ask
 it
 shall
 be
 given
 unto
 him
 And
 in
 that
 day
 Satan
 shall
 not
 have
 power
 to
 tempt
 any
 man
 And
 there
 shall
 be
 no
 sorrow
 because
 there
 is
 no
 death
 In
 that
 day
 an
 infant
 shall
 not
 die
 until
 he
 is
 old
 and
 his
 life
 shall
 be
 as
 the
 age
 of
 a
 tree
 and
 when
 he
 dies
 he
 shall
 not
 sleep
 that
 is
 to
 say
 in
 the
 earth
 but
 shall
 be
 changed
 in
 the
 twinkling
 of
 an
 eye
 and
 shall
 be
 caught
 up
 and
 his
 rest
 shall
 be
 glorious
 Yea
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 in
 that
 day
 when
 the
 Lord
 shall
 come
 he
 shall
 reveal
 all
 things
 The
 Millennium
 is
 to
 precede
 the
 time
 designated
 in
 scriptural
 phrase
 the
 end
 of
 the
 world
 When
 the
 thousand
 years
 are
 passed
 Satan
 shall
 be
 loosed
 for
 a
 little
 season
 and
 the
 final
 test
 of
 mans
 integrity
 to
 God
 shall
 ensue
 Such
 as
 are
 prone
 to
 impurity
 of
 heart
 shall
 yield
 to
 temptation
 while
 the
 righteous
 shall
 endure
 to
 the
 end
 A
 revelation
 to
 this
 effect
 was
 given
 the
 Church
 in
 
 in
 part
 as
 follows
 For
 the
 great
 Millennium
 of
 which
 I
 have
 spoken
 by
 the
 mouth
 of
 my
 servants
 shall
 come
 For
 Satan
 shall
 be
 bound
 and
 when
 he
 is
 loosed
 again
 he
 shall
 only
 reign
 for
 a
 little
 season
 and
 then
 cometh
 the
 end
 of
 the
 earth
 And
 he
 that
 liveth
 in
 righteousness
 shall
 be
 changed
 in
 the
 twinkling
 of
 an
 eye
 and
 the
 earth
 shall
 pass
 away
 so
 as
 by
 fire
 And
 the
 wicked
 shall
 go
 away
 into
 unquenchable
 fire
 and
 their
 end
 no
 man
 knoweth
 on
 earth
 nor
 ever
 shall
 know
 until
 they
 come
 before
 me
 in
 judgment
 Hearken
 ye
 to
 these
 words
 Behold
 I
 am
 Jesus
 Christ
 the
 Saviour
 of
 the
 world
 Treasure
 these
 things
 up
 in
 your
 hearts
 and
 let
 the
 solemnities
 of
 eternity
 rest
 upon
 your
 minds
 THE
 CELESTIAL
 CONSUMMATION
 The
 vanquishment
 of
 Satan
 and
 his
 hosts

 be
 complete
 The

 shall

 God

 to
 the
 record
 as
 written
 in
 the
 books
 So
 shall
 be
 brought
 to
 glorious
 consummation
 the
 mission
 of
 the
 Christ
 Then
 cometh
 the
 end
 when
 he
 shall
 have
 delivered
 up
 the
 kingdom
 to
 God
 even
 the
 Father
 when
 he
 shall
 have
 put
 down

 all

 For
 he
 must
 reign
 till
 he
 hath
 put
 all
 enemies
 under

 feet
 The
 last
 enemy
 that
 shall
 be
 destroyed
 is
 death
 For
 he
 hath
 put
 all
 things
 under
 his
 feet
 Then
 shall
 the
 Lord

 up

 it

 NOTES
 TO
 CHAPTER
 
 
 Enoch
 spoken
 of
 by
 Jude
 as
 the
 seventh
 from
 Adam
 was
 the
 father
 of
 Methuselah
 In
 Genesis
 
 we
 read
 And
 Enoch
 walked
 with
 God
 and
 he
 was
 not
 for
 God
 took
 him
 From
 the
 Lords
 revelation
 to
 Moses
 we
 learn
 that
 Enoch
 was
 a
 mighty
 man
 favored
 of
 God
 because
 of
 his
 righteousness
 and
 a
 leader
 of
 and
 revelator
 to
 his
 people
 Through
 his
 agency
 a
 city
 was
 built
 the
 inhabitants
 of
 which
 excelled
 in
 righteous
 living
 to
 such
 an
 extent
 that
 they
 were
 of
 one
 heart
 and
 one
 mind
 and
 had
 no
 poor
 among
 them
 It
 was
 called
 the
 City
 of
 Holiness
 or
 Zion
 The
 residue
 of
 the
 race
 were
 all
 corrupt
 in
 the
 sight
 of
 the
 Lord
 Enoch
 and
 his
 people
 were
 taken
 from
 the
 earth
 and
 are
 to
 return
 with
 Christ
 at
 His
 coming
 P

 compare

 and
 Cov
 
 
 
 Heathen
 in
 the
 First
 ResurrectionAnd
 then
 shall
 the
 heathen
 nations
 be
 redeemed
 and
 they
 that
 knew
 no
 law
 shall
 have
 part
 in
 the
 first
 resurrection
 and
 it
 shall
 be
 tolerable
 for
 them
 Doc
 and
 Cov
 
 Such
 is
 the
 word
 of
 the
 Lord
 with
 respect
 to
 those
 benighted
 peoples
 who
 live
 and
 die
 in
 ignorance
 of
 the
 laws
 of
 the
 gospel
 This
 affirmation
 is
 sustained
 by
 other
 scriptures
 and
 by
 a
 consideration
 of
 the
 principles
 of
 true
 justice
 according
 to
 which
 humanity
 is
 to
 be
 judged
 Man
 shall
 be
 accounted
 blameless
 or
 guilty
 according
 to
 his
 deeds
 as
 interpreted
 in
 the
 light
 of
 the
 law
 under
 which
 he
 is
 required
 to
 live
 It
 is
 inconsistent
 with
 our
 conception
 of
 a
 just
 God
 to
 believe
 Him
 capable
 of
 inflicting
 condemnation
 upon
 any
 one
 for
 noncompliance
 with
 a
 requirement
 of
 which
 the
 person
 had
 no
 knowledge
 Nevertheless
 the
 laws
 of
 the
 gospel
 cannot
 be
 suspended
 even
 in
 the
 case
 of
 those
 who
 have
 sinned
 in
 darkness
 and
 ignorance
 but
 it
 is
 reasonable
 to
 believe
 that
 the
 plan
 of
 redemption
 shall
 afford
 such
 benighted
 ones
 an
 opportunity
 of
 learning
 the
 laws
 of
 God
 and
 as
 fast
 as
 they
 so
 learn
 will
 obedience
 be
 required
 on
 pain
 of
 the
 penalty

 Regeneration
 of
 the
 EarthIn
 speaking
 of
 the
 graded
 and
 progressive
 glories
 provided
 for
 His
 creations
 and
 of
 the
 laws
 of
 regeneration
 and
 sanctification
 the
 Lord
 has
 thus
 spoken
 through
 revelation
 in
 the
 present
 dispensation
 And
 again
 verily
 I
 say
 unto
 you
 the
 earth
 abideth
 the
 law
 of
 a
 celestial
 kingdom
 for
 it
 filleth
 the
 measure
 of
 its
 creation
 and
 transgresseth
 not
 the
 law
 Wherefore
 it
 shall
 be
 sanctified
 yea
 notwithstanding
 it
 shall
 die
 it
 shall
 be
 quickened
 again
 and
 shall
 abide
 the
 power
 by
 which
 it
 is
 quickened
 and
 the
 righteous
 shall
 inherit
 it

 Cov
 
 
 This
 appointed
 change
 by
 which
 the
 earth
 shall
 pass
 to
 the
 condition
 of
 a
 celestialized
 world
 is
 referred
 to
 in
 numerous
 scriptures
 as
 the
 institution
 of
 a
 new
 heaven

 new
